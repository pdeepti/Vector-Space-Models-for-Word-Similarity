the law makes it illegal to incite terrorism abroad and was introduced following complaints that several foreign groups have been using london as a base .
the list includes the greek group , november 17 , which murdered the uk diplomat , brigadier stephen saunders , in athens last year and has killed 24 other people in 80 attacks .
some people may argue that this is an attack on muslims .
that would be entirely wrong charles clarke also listed is the basque separatist group eta , four palestinian organisations , three kashmiri and two turkish groups .
previously only organisations involved in violence in northern ireland had been proscribed .
no further uk groups have been added .
more more than half of the 21 names listed are muslim in origin , but home office minister charles clarke insisted this should not be seen as an attack on individual communities .
he said : " i am aware that there are some people who may argue within the muslim community that this is an attack on muslims .
that would be entirely wrong . "
organisations with middle eastern links now facing a ban include the hezbollah external security organisation , palestinian islamic jihad , the abu nibal organisation and mujaheddin e khalq .
also on the list is al-qa 'iba , which was set up by the renegade saudi millionaire , osama bin laden , and has been blamed for the bombing of two american embassies in africa .
under the new law , police have powers to seize assets and arrest those who use violence or the threat of it " for the purpose of advancing a political , religious or ideological cause " .
even fund-raising or openly supporting a banned organisation could lead to arrest .
the new powers redefine terrorist violence to include attacks on property as well as people .
liberty fears civil liberties campaigners have accused mr straw of potentially criminalising environmental campaigners as well as exiles fighting to topple dictatorial regimes in their homeland .
and they claim he is trying to placate governments abroad , including saudi arabia , which accuse the uk of being a haven for people regarded by some ruling regimes as terrorists .
the new names will be added to a list of proscribed organisations , which currently includes irish groups such as the ira and the ulster volunteer force .
the draft order listing proscribed organisations must be approved by both houses of parliament before it becomes law .

the horizon vanishes in a haze of sand .
the ubiquitous black , white , green and red flags of the saharawi arab democratic republic -lrb- sadr -rrb- flutter from their masts .
the tents are maintained to give our people the sense that we are not going to be here forever brahim moktar , polisario spokesman it is one of the harshest and most inhospitable environments on earth , yet more than 150,000 people have had to live here for the past 25 years , while dreaming of independence for their homeland , the disputed territory of western sahara .
life in tents metou mustafa is a symbol of the struggle .
refugees fear that the un may abandon its support for a referendum on independence she was born in the refugee camps 25 years ago and has known no other life .
" i have never seen my country .
i listen to people describing it as a beautiful place full of rich customs , but i have been deprived of this , " metou says .
" living here in the algerian desert has become routine , but it is also very hard .
what keeps us going day after day and year after year , is the hope of eventually returning to western sahara . "
the refugees are almost entirely dependent upon aid for their survival .
polisario leaders are under pressure to return to war food is imported and the four huge camps near tindouf do not even have adequate local water supplies .
tankers ferry water continuously .
the mud-brick homes that have been built convey an air of permanence , but even after 25 years , some refugees still live in tents .
" the tents are maintained to give our people the sense that we are not going to be here forever , " explains brahim moktar , a polisario spokesman .
visitors to the saharawi refugee camps are overwhelmed by the conditions .
the 1991 ceasefire has not yet resulted in a referendum in summer , temperatures are said to reach 50 ° c. among the participants in the sahara marathon , a special event to mark the 25th anniversary of the sadr , was the former commonwealth games champion , ron hill , who has completed marathons in 67 different countries .
" i can not imagine what it is like to live here , " he says .
" just coming for four days is a thing in itself , and this was one of the toughest places in which i have ever run . "
the forgotten conflict on 27 february 1976 the polisario front set up the sadr , essentially a government-in-exile .
victory sign conceals distant dream of independence for the next 15 years , polisario fought a guerrilla war against morocco which occupies most of western sahara and lays claim to the territory .
a ceasefire in 1991 offered the promise of a political settlement .
however , a united nations-sponsored referendum to decide whether western sahara should become independent or integrated into morocco has never been held , nine years after it was planned .
the refugee community is dependent on outside aid the process has become bogged down by continuing disagreement over who should be allowed to vote and an appeals process .
polisario 's supporters now fear that the un and other key western nations want to abandon the referendum and pursue " a third way " , allowing the saharawis a degree of autonomy in western sahara , but not full independence .
back to war ?
the mood in the refugee camps is one of impatience , frustration and anger at the years of diplomatic deadlock .
people live for the hope of return the polisario front says it is under pressure from its supporters to return to war .
" the resumption of the conflict could be at any time , " says meloud said , polisario 's representative in washington .
" we have been taken for a ride for the last nine years , and if we go back to war , it is because we have already gone the extra mile for peace and there is nothing else we can do , " he adds .
the resumption of the conflict could be at any time meloud said , polisario 's representative in washington it is difficult to assess the seriousness of the polisario front 's threats .
some observers believe that , without the backing of its long-time sponsor , algeria , the polisario front would be unlikely to abandon the ceasefire .
however , the sadr president , mohamed abdelaziz , who presided over a huge military parade at this week 's 25th anniversary celebrations in the laayoune refugee camp , warned that " peace is in jeopardy " and that his people should be ready to make " further sacrifices " .
polisario say they keep people in tents to give them hope of return the un , which has a military observer mission -lrb- minurso -rrb- in western sahara , is worried .
in his latest report , the un secretary-general , kofi annan , says " a climate of increased mistrust and bitterness has set in between morocco and the polisario front and this is undermining the ceasefire regime " .
in spite of the traditional display of support for the polisario front at this week 's celebrations , the saharawis have little to celebrate .
in the present climate , their dreams of an independent western sahara appear to be as far away as ever .

it was earlier this week that the first of the householders involved started moving out of their moredun park homes .
similar underground conditions had been detected there as in neighbouring ferniehill , where a number of properties collapsed last autumn and subsequently had to be demolished .
subsidence in old quarry workings has been blamed , for a situation described by a local councillor as unprecedented in scotland .
according to city housing officials , 30 individuals and families are already out of the moredun park buildings .
fourteen more , they say , will be leaving on thursday and the final 10 on friday .
all are joining relatives or switching to alternative accommodation .
guards started patrolling the area on wednesday night and security fencing is being erected .
on monday examination of the site will start , with bore holes being drilled and sonar probes used .
it was disclosed on wednesday that investigators are also to check about 12 more spots in edinburgh as a precaution .
the scottish executive has said it will consider providing financial aid for the residents who have to move home .
an executive spokeswoman said it had set up a co-ordination group to provide support for edinburgh city council .
