the parliament 's presiding officer sir david steel said he was concerned that several members appeared to be encouraging the demonstrators .
the scottish national party msp for the lothians margo macdonald , who joined the demonstrators in the public gallery , said she shares their frustration because democracy is letting them down .
sir david told msps he was concerned that some members applauded the demonstrators .
he said that it is a serious matter to encourage the disruption of parliament .
about 11 protesters chanted and sang as first minister 's questions - led by deputy first minister jim wallace - got underway .
they tied themselves to the railings in the public gallery with plastic ties .
the presiding officer suspended the sitting for about 15 minutes to allow security staff to clear the protesters from the chamber .
the demonstrators - most of whom were women - unfurled banners , shouted and sung out protests and threw pieces of paper down onto the ranks of msps below .
sir david 's investigation should be completed by the time msps return from the easter recess in two weeks .
it is not clear what measures he could take against the msps concerned .
afterwards margo macdonald said she supported the reasons for the protesters to be there .
she said she would not normally encourage disruption of the democratic process - but she shares the frustration of the demonstrators that democracy and the parliament is letting them down by refusing to debate nuclear weapons because it is a reserved matter to westminster .
trident ploughshares group protester ellen moxley , 66 , who described herself as an observer to the protest , was not arrested .
she said : " the aim of today was to highlight in our own people 's parliament the fact that we have genocidal nuclear weapons on scottish soil and that we are not able to debate it because it is a reserved issue .
nuclear weapons " this is extremely important because 51 % of people in scotland do n't want trident submarines in scotland . "
she said the decision for the protest was taken after last week 's " perverse " judgement at the high court which found that nuclear weapons were not illegal .
lothian and borders police said 11 people had been arrested for breach or the peace and a report was being sent to the procurator fiscal .
scottish socialist msp tommy sheridan praised the protesters , saying : " these peace campaigners acted with dignity and deserve the support of msps for bringing the whole issue of trident and the need for disarmament into the chamber . "

children with higher than average iqs at the age of 11 are more likely to live into their seventies , the study found .
its author says more research is needed into the issue to establish possible links between social deprivation , mental ability and lifespans .
experts are not sure why intelligence is linked to longevity , but say genetic and economic factors , childhood illness and diet may be part of the reason .
both sexes with high iqs were found to live past the age of 60 researchers used details of iq tests taken by 2,792 children in aberdeen at the age of 11 in 1932 and then followed them up to see who was still alive in 1997 .
they found that both men and women with higher iq scores as youngsters were much more likely to be alive 60 years later .
the researchers took an average iq in the group as 100 .
those still living at the age of 76 had an average iq score of 102 at the age of 11 , while those who had died by 1997 had an average 97.7 score .
a 15-point lower score meant people had a fifth less chance of seeing their 76th birthday , while those with a 30-point disadvantage were 37 % less likely than those with a higher iq to live that long .
the link was weaker in men , but this could be because the second world war increased the male death rate .
' adds to our knowledge ' interestingly , men who died during active service in the war had a relatively high iq .
study author professor lawrence whalley of the university of edinburgh said : " our data show that high mental ability in late childhood reduces the chances of death up to age 76 .
" the effect is not caused by a single factor and may even be reversed , as was found for men during the second world war .
" this result adds to our knowledge of the traits in youth that contribute to survival in subsequent decades . "
he called for more research into the issue , addressing the links between social deprivation , mental ability and lifespans .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- apec 's free trade struggle low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 6 april , 2001 , 07:22 gmt 08:22 uk apec 's free trade struggle president clinton said the next century would be the pacific century the asia-pacific economic cooperation forum was set up as an attempt to forge a free trade pact in the pacific - but so far that goal has proved elusive .
it was to be based on voluntary cooperation , rather than the binding agreements of the world trade organisation .
the idea was to link the world 's biggest exporters in asia with the world 's biggest importer - the united states .
however , the diverse nature of its membership - which includes developed countries like japan along with developing countries like china , indonesia and singapore - meant that progress towards trade liberalisation has been slower than hoped .
and the asian crisis of 1997-98 , when many asian countries devalued their currencies in the face of a financial crisis , has also increased tensions in the region .
but apec is still potentially a huge trade bloc , making up half the world 's gdp and 43 % of its trade .
but the dynamic economic growth in the region has slowed , weakening the impetus to implement a trade agreement .
voluntary codes apec had its origin in the fears of the big exporting nations of asia that they might be at a disadvantage , as the world formed into trade blocs , such as the european union and nafta .
in particular , south korea and taiwan , two big trading nations with fast-expanding exports , wanted to ensure that they could participate in regional trade liberalisation .
in 1989 , they joined forces with the asean countries of south-east asia - who were already trying to form a regional free-trade pact - as well as australia , usa , canada and japan .
a key element in the early development of apec was the fact that the rival regimes of china , taiwan and hong kong -lrb- which was still a british colony -rrb- all joined in 1991 .
as apec become more successful , a number of other countries , especially in latin america , sought membership , as did russia which was admitted in 1998 .
both hong kong and china joined apec in 1991 a formal secretariat was established in singapore in 1991 , and apec began organising a series of yearly meetings which culminate in a heads-of-state summit each autumn .
apec now has 21 members , namely australia , brunei , canada , chile , china , hong kong , indonesia , japan , south korea , malaysia , mexico , new zealand , papua new guinea , peru , philippines , russia , singapore , taiwan , thailand , united states , and vietnam .
boost by clinton apec was initially seen as just a talking shop for trade ministers .
but it was given a boost by the new us president bill clinton in 1993 when he invited apec heads of state to meet him in washington state .
he proclaimed that the next century would be the pacific century , and that us had a vital interest in the development of free trade and democracy in the apec region .
the next year , apec agreed a goal of creating an open trading system in the pacific , with a target of 2010 for full trade liberalisation by the rich countries , and 2020 for its developing countries .
in 1997 , apec agreed a plan to liberalise trade in 15 key sectors , including chemicals , fish , forest products , gems , medical equipment , and toys .
asian crisis but already the trade liberalisation agenda was under threat from the asian crisis , which led to open disagreement between the apec 's two largest economies , the usa and japan .
as the currencies of most of apec 's members faced dramatic devaluation 's , differences emerged over how to deal with the crisis .
japan wanted to set up a yen-based rescue fund to bail out the south-east asian economies that it was closely linked to , administered through apec or on a regional basis .
the united states , however , was strongly opposed to what was seen as early steps towards the creation of a " yen bloc " .
instead , it favoured bilateral , country-by-country negotiations with the imf for rescue packages , accompanied by further liberalisation of the financial sector in apec countries .
in the end , the us view prevailed - but the heavy-handed nature of some of the imf rescue packages , and the continuing economic weaknesses of some apec members , have slowed progress towards voluntary trade liberalisation .
china 's challenge now the biggest challenge faced by apec is the rapid rise in the economic power of china , which is in the process of joining the world trade organisation .
apec is holding its annual summit in shanghai this year in recognition of china 's new place in the world economic order .
but increased tensions between the us and china are making life in apec more difficult .
as well as the tensions over military matters , the us is growing increasingly sceptical that china will end its subsidies to its state-run industries , as provided for by the wto agreement .
and china wants an expanded role in the region , challenging japan as its economic leader and offering trade deals and financial support to other apec countries .
meanwhile , sub-regional trade blocs - for example , in the asean countries of south-east asia - are growing , as countries try to end their dependence on japan .
the recession in the united states has increased protectionist pressures - and the bush administration is moving towards a free trade pact in the americas .
so as the new century begins , the vision of an integrated pacific trade zone seems to be more of a pipe-dream than a reality .

it was to be based on voluntary cooperation , rather than the binding agreements of the world trade organisation .
the idea was to link the world 's biggest exporters in asia with the world 's biggest importer - the united states .
however , the diverse nature of its membership - which includes developed countries like japan along with developing countries like china , indonesia and singapore - meant that progress towards trade liberalisation has been slower than hoped .
and the asian crisis of 1997-98 , when many asian countries devalued their currencies in the face of a financial crisis , has also increased tensions in the region .
but apec is still potentially a huge trade bloc , making up half the world 's gdp and 43 % of its trade .
but the dynamic economic growth in the region has slowed , weakening the impetus to implement a trade agreement .
voluntary codes apec had its origin in the fears of the big exporting nations of asia that they might be at a disadvantage , as the world formed into trade blocs , such as the european union and nafta .
in particular , south korea and taiwan , two big trading nations with fast-expanding exports , wanted to ensure that they could participate in regional trade liberalisation .
in 1989 , they joined forces with the asean countries of south-east asia - who were already trying to form a regional free-trade pact - as well as australia , usa , canada and japan .
a key element in the early development of apec was the fact that the rival regimes of china , taiwan and hong kong -lrb- which was still a british colony -rrb- all joined in 1991 .
as apec become more successful , a number of other countries , especially in latin america , sought membership , as did russia which was admitted in 1998 .
a formal secretariat was established in singapore in 1991 , and apec began organising a series of yearly meetings which culminate in a heads-of-state summit each autumn .
apec now has 21 members , namely australia , brunei , canada , chile , china , hong kong , indonesia , japan , south korea , malaysia , mexico , new zealand , papua new guinea , peru , philippines , russia , singapore , taiwan , thailand , united states , and vietnam .
boost by clinton apec was initially seen as just a talking shop for trade ministers .
but it was given a boost by the new us president bill clinton in 1993 when he invited apec heads of state to meet him in washington state .
he proclaimed that the next century would be the pacific century , and that us had a vital interest in the development of free trade and democracy in the apec region .
the next year , apec agreed a goal of creating an open trading system in the pacific , with a target of 2010 for full trade liberalisation by the rich countries , and 2020 for its developing countries .
in 1997 , apec agreed a plan to liberalise trade in 15 key sectors , including chemicals , fish , forest products , gems , medical equipment , and toys .
asian crisis but already the trade liberalisation agenda was under threat from the asian crisis , which led to open disagreement between the apec 's two largest economies , the usa and japan .
as the currencies of most of apec 's members faced dramatic devaluation 's , differences emerged over how to deal with the crisis .
japan wanted to set up a yen-based rescue fund to bail out the south-east asian economies that it was closely linked to , administered through apec or on a regional basis .
the united states , however , was strongly opposed to what was seen as early steps towards the creation of a " yen bloc " .
instead , it favoured bilateral , country-by-country negotiations with the imf for rescue packages , accompanied by further liberalisation of the financial sector in apec countries .
in the end , the us view prevailed - but the heavy-handed nature of some of the imf rescue packages , and the continuing economic weaknesses of some apec members , have slowed progress towards voluntary trade liberalisation .
china 's challenge now the biggest challenge faced by apec is the rapid rise in the economic power of china , which is in the process of joining the world trade organisation .
apec is holding its annual summit in shanghai this year in recognition of china 's new place in the world economic order .
but increased tensions between the us and china are making life in apec more difficult .
as well as the tensions over military matters , the us is growing increasingly sceptical that china will end its subsidies to its state-run industries , as provided for by the wto agreement .
and china wants an expanded role in the region , challenging japan as its economic leader and offering trade deals and financial support to other apec countries .
meanwhile , sub-regional trade blocs - for example , in the asean countries of south-east asia - are growing , as countries try to end their dependence on japan .
the recession in the united states has increased protectionist pressures - and the bush administration is moving towards a free trade pact in the americas .
so as the new century begins , the vision of an integrated pacific trade zone seems to be more of a pipe-dream than a reality .

in addition , he faces challenges in the us congress , where democrats may seek to withhold fast-track authority from mr bush if he fails to include environmental and labour standards in any free-trade negotiations .
despite the success of the north american free trade agreement , or nafta , which came into effect seven years ago , the lack of a coherent us trade policy has left other countries , including those in central and south america , wondering which way to turn .
in the absence of a substantial broadly based free-trade pact -lrb- and us leadership -rrb- , western hemisphere countries have either signed or are negotiating over 50 regional trade pacts .
one goal for mr bush in attending the summit of americas is to finish up where mr clinton - and mr bush 's own father - left off by implementing the free trade area of the americas -lrb- ftaa -rrb- , which would link all the western hemisphere 's economies -lrb- except cuba -rrb- .
the elder mr bush , when he was president , dreamed of such a free-trade agreement that would stretch from anchorage to tierra del fuego .
history of nafta the precursor to the ftaa is , of course , nafta , which created the world 's largest free-trade zone between the us , canada and mexico .
it was implement in 1994 and promised , among other things , to bring prosperity to mexico , cheaper goods to the us and ignite job growth in all three countries .
nafta began in earnest in december 1992 when then-us president bush , mexican president salinas and canadian prime minister mulroney signed the north american free trade agreement in three separate ceremonies in each nation 's capital .
in the us , the congress approved the trade deal less than a year later , and newly elected president clinton signed the bill , public law 103-182 into law on 8 december 1993 , which then took effect the following 1 january .
under nafta , the us , canada , and mexico became a single , giant , integrated market of 400 million people with $ 6.5 trillion worth of goods and services annually .
mexico is the world 's second largest importer of us manufactured goods and the third largest importer of us agricultural products .
prior to nafta , mexican tariffs averaged about 250 % , compared to us duties .
after the pact , about half of the tariffs on trade between mexico and the united states were eliminated .
the united states and canada have had a free-trade agreement since 1989 .
the treaty provides full protection of intellectual property rights -lrb- patents , copyrights and trademarks -rrb- and also includes provisions covering trade rules and dispute settlement .
nafta fallout since its inception , critics of nafta have stepped up their efforts to halt what they feel are the failures of free trade .
among them : job losses , environmental degradation and a burgeoning trade deficit .
that could not have been more evident than at last year 's world trade organization meeting in seattle , which saw scores of protestors beaten and arrested in rallying against the perceived injustices of free trade .
those opposed to a free trade area for the americas intend to make their voices heard in quebec city , even as ftaa is but one topic that is to be discussed at the conference .
job losses depending on to whom you talk , nafta has either been a resounding success or an incredible failure .
public citizen , a government and business watchdog group founded by ralph nader , gave nafta a failing grade in 1999 , saying the treaty failed the most conservative of all tests - to do no harm .
public citizen blames nafta for the loss of hundreds of thousands of full-time , high-wage manufacturing jobs in the us and noted that of the 67 companies it surveyed , 60 had not created any jobs .
but others see the free-trade pact as a success .
economics professor j. bradford delong at the university of california at berkeley credits nafta for moving mexico toward democracy and prosperity and has argued that us has both a strong interest and a neighbourly duty to try to help mexican political and economic development .
by that yardstick , professor delong says , nafta is a qualified success .
nafta has helped mexico economically and in doing so has brought with it political reform with a shift toward more democratic institutions .
