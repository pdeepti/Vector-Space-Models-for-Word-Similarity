the draft law , which is designed to end a quarter of a century of separatist violence , gives the island limited law-making powers and extends corsican language teaching .
the reforms , which were brokered by prime minister lionel jospin , have been extremely controversial .
the violence has far from died out , and has even gained momentum opposition mp nicolas dupont-aignan the conservative opposition opposes the bill arguing that it is unconstitutional and that it would undermine the french state by paving the way to full corsican independence .
it plans to take its two most contentious articles to france 's constitutional council - the body that rules on new laws - and ask it to strike them out .
the bill was narrowly passed by the combined votes of the ruling socialists and their green party allies , with the communists - who are also in government - abstaining .
four corsican deputies in the national assembly also declined to support the bill .
the bill is the product of months of talks between mr jospin and local leaders last year .
on monday the corsican national liberation front -lrb- flnc -rrb- claimed responsibility for 17 recent armed attacks on police barracks and ministry buildings , and blamed paris ' " lack of political courage " for an increase in tension .
corsica , which has a population of 260,000 , has been prey to sporadic separatist violence since the mid-1970s , but the main paramilitary groups have in theory maintained a ceasefire since the start of last year .
the proposed devolution would mark an important break with the centralising tradition of french politics .

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- nhs trusts sink deeper into the red categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 19 december , 2001 , 06:29 gmt nhs trusts sink deeper into the red budget deficits among nhs trusts have risen sharply nhs trusts north of the border are £ 24m more in the red than last year , it has been revealed .
the deficits were highlighted in a report by scotland 's auditor general , robert black who monitors spending across the public sector .
his findings show that eight trusts failed to break even in 2000/2001 and many more , particularly acute hospital trusts , faced growing financial pressures .
ministers said the figures referred to " historic deficits " which were being cleared but opposition parties cited them as evidence that the nhs was declining under the labour dominated scottish executive .
trust deficits tayside - £ 15.9m lanarkshire - £ 12.7m north glasgow - £ 9.5m grampian - £ 4.9m south glasgow - £ 4.1m argyll and clyde - £ 3m highland - £ 2.7m renfrewshire and inverclyde - £ 1.1m the report , overview of the national health service in scotland , shows that the accumulated deficits among scottish nhs trusts have risen by around 44 % to £ 54m .
in his report mr black said that financial stewardship of the nhs 's £ 6bn scottish budget continued to be of a high standard .
he also acknowledged the additional £ 90m allocated by ministers in september to alleviate the financial pressures on trusts but pointed out that it was a " one-off " injection .
mr black said : " it is clear that many trusts - particularly acute hospital trusts - faced mounting financial pressures in 2000/01 .
" indications are that these pressures are continuing .
many trusts will be challenged by new and continuing pressures on budgets if they are to achieve financial balance . "
' reducing waiting times ' the report says that factors such as changing populations , technological advances and rising service costs will cause increased financial pressures in future .
it also expresses concerns about the rate of progress in developing procedures for checking the £ 1.3bn in payments made to doctors , dentists , pharmacists and opticians .
mr black added : " the setting up of an fraud investigation unit is an important development but all the initiatives need to be pursued urgently to ensure that there is a robust and consistent approach to payment verification across scotland . "
auditor general : " financial pressures " health minister malcolm chisholm said the overall financial position of the nhs in scotland had improved over the last three years and that it had begun this financial year debt-free .
" the deficit figures refer to historic trust deficits at the year end 2000-01 , " he said .
" these were all completely cleared by an additional £ 79m we invested in september to free up the nhs to concentrate on reducing waiting times and other key targets . "
the scottish national party said the figures proved that the nhs was no longer safe in the hands of labour ministers .
the party 's health spokeswoman nicola sturgeon said : " the reality is that under labour the nhs is struggling to make ends meet and patients are suffering as a result .
' financial mis-management ' " the latest figures show that 107,000 people in scotland are currently waiting for treatment and that the average waiting time is 91 days - two weeks longer than when labour came to power .
" and when we consider that north glasgow university hospitals nhs trust alone accumulated a deficit of £ 9.5m , it becomes much easier to understand why the beatson oncology centre is in such a state of crisis . "
scottish conservative health spokesman mary scanlon said the executive had sent out a message that it was willing to bail out overspending public bodies when it announced a one-off lump sum to clear the deficits of nhs trusts .
mary scanlon : " appalling figures " " the executive must ensure it does not make a habit of bailing out health trust overspending , " she said .
" it must not give the green light to financial mis-management .
" as jack mcconnell stressed on becoming first minister , throwing money at a problem is unlikely to provide the solution .
" reform , and not necessarily more money , is the answer to the ills of our health care system .
" the executive must shoulder its responsibilities for these appalling figures and come to terms with the need for radical reform of the nhs . "
