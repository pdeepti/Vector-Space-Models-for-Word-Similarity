parents whose babies with down 's syndrome were referred to the royal brompton hospital in london had claimed that they were unjustly refused lifesaving heart surgery .
the inquiry report , to be published on monday morning , says it has found evidence of discriminatory attitudes , and makes dozens of recommendations aimed at stamping this out .
however , it said that doctors did act in " good faith " , believing that what they were doing was in the best interests of the patient , and did not intentionally discriminate against the down 's patients .
however , it reports , " that was , in our opinion , the effect of their approach . "
we are pleased that the parents who have been through such a lot have been totally vindicated spokesman , down 's syndrome association and the report clears surgeons at the hospital of more general allegations that their death rates were too high .
the " whistleblower " who made the claims about death rates is criticised in the report .
the inquiry panel , chaired by ruth evans , head of the national consumer council , has taken 18 months to produce the 400 page document , and taken evidence from dozens of parents .
many claimed similar experiences - that the hospital was unwilling to carry out corrective surgery on the heart defects of down 's syndrome babies .
delight over report some have accused the hospital of placing less value on the lives of down 's syndrome babies than other infants .
penny green , from the down 's heart group , which advises parents of down 's children with heart problems , said : " it has caused an incredible amount of distress among families .
" living with the death of a child is very difficult , but i ca n't imagine how these families feel , seeing their child deteriorate , knowing that if they had gone somewhere else , their child may have had a chance .
" you have to accept that there was a problem in the past , and put things into place so it ca n't happen in the future . "
a spokesman for the down 's syndrome association said she was " delighted " with the report .
she said : " broadly , we would welcome all the recommendations made in the report .
we are pleased that the parents who have been through such a lot have been totally vindicated . "
the association said it was looking forward to working with the hospital to ensure all children with heart defects received the correct care in future .
one of the parents who contacted the inquiry was maxine hanson , whose son ben was operated on at great ormond street hospital after doctors at the brompton had recommended he wait five years for a similar operation there .
she said : " hopefully the recommendations they have put forward will be a good thing .
we have got our goal , which is to put the spotlight on this sort of discrimination . "
children with down 's can do well after heart surgery while , in the 1970s and early 1980s , when success rates in paediatric cardiac surgery were generally much lower , there was a genuine debate about the merits of surgery on down 's syndrome children , subsequent improvements in techniques have made the issue more clear-cut .
there is no particular reason why a child with down 's syndrome and a heart defect should fare any worse either during or after a complex operation .
the down 's syndrome association spokesman said : " the debate over whether or not children with down 's syndrome were suitable for heart operations has been over for some time .
" the tide began to turn by the early 1990s .
discrimination is more through ignorance and lack of information . "
the report makes it clear that when down 's syndrome patients did receive treatment at the brompton , it was of equal quality to that received by any other patient .
the report has disappointed those who believe that , as a whole , the hospital 's death rates in paediatric cardiac care were poor .
a review carried out by expert professor stewart hunter has found no evidence to support this .
results at the unit were as good , if not better , than at many other uk heart hospitals , he says .
however , josephine ocloo , who is convinced that poor care contributed to the death of her 17-year-old daughter krista , denounced this finding as a " sham " , and called on brompton chief executive mark taylor to resign .
approximately 40 % of all children born with down 's syndrome , a genetic defect , have a heart problem , such as a " hole in the heart " , and they make a large proportion of the children referred to paediatric cardiologists in the uk .

the bank of japan 's quarterly " tankan " index has fallen to -5 this month , from a figure of + 10 last december as more firms take a negative view of economic prospects .
the stock market fell after the report was released the bbc tokyo correspondent says the fall is the latest indication that the japanese slow-down may be heading towards a recession .
the bank of japan has recently cut interest rates in response to slowing economic growth , a declining stock market and fears of deflation .
the tankan survey is one of the bank of japan 's main sources of data about the health of the economy .
big drop it subtracts the percentage of companies reporting unfavourable conditions from those with a more positive outlook .
the index of minus five from january to march was worse than some economists had predicted and a big drop from last december 's figure of plus ten .
the survey also found that big companies were planning to cut capital spending , with further negative consequences .
japanese companies have been hit hard by the slow-down in the united states economy .
drastic action healthy exports were an important ingredient in the country 's tentative recovery last year .
the bank of japan took drastic action last month in a bid to revive the economy and stave off the threat of deflation .
it effectively reduced interest rates to zero by pumping extra money into the financial system .
that led to some gains on the stock market in recent days but much will now depend on follow-up action by the government and its efforts to force banks to write off their heavy burden of bad loans .
a further fall in the value of the yen could also give hope to japanese exporters by making their products more competitive in overseas markets .
