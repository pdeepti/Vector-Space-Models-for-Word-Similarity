he is the first former head of state to stand accused of crimes against humanity in an international court .
when the hearing begins at 0800 gmt on tuesday , he will be asked to plead guilty or not guilty of crimes arising from the killing and deportation of ethnic albanians in kosovo in 1999 .
mr milosevic has already said he does not recognise the authority of the tribunal in the hague , and has described the charges - which carry a possible life sentence - as political .
he has declined to appoint a defence counsel , despite meeting two lawyers on monday , who had been representing him before his extradition from belgrade .
one of them , zdenko tomanovic , said because mr milosevic did not recognise the tribunal he would not allow lawyers to appear before it .
political statement mr milosevic will attend tuesday morning 's hearing to hear the indictment against him read out .
but his lawyers seemed to indicate that instead of entering a plea he may try to make a political statement .
the bbc 's angus roxburgh in the hague says tribunal judges have in the past clamped down on any such attempts to make speeches .
if mr milosevic refuses to enter a plea within 30 days of the initial hearing , a plea of " not guilty " will automatically be entered for him under the rules of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia .
visa considered following the arraignment , both sides are expected to spend months preparing their cases for a trial which could take years .
the dutch authorities are considering whether to allow mr milosevic 's wife , mira markovic , an entry visa so that she can be present at her husband 's court appearance .
charges against milosevic deportation , a crime against humanity murder , a crime against humanity murder , a violation of the laws or customs of war persecutions on political , racial and religious grounds , a crime against humanity as part of remaining european union sanctions against mr milosevic 's regime , members of his family are not allowed access to eu member states .
meanwhile , politicians in belgrade are struggling to deal with the aftermath of the extradition , which set serbian prime minister zoran djindjic against the incumbent yugoslav president , vojislav kostunica , and brought down the yugoslav government .
talks on forming a new government have been postponed for 10 days .
milosevic supporters have pledged to continue demonstrating against his handover - 15,000 marched through the centre of belgrade on monday .
suicide watch the un tribunal is keeping mr milosevic in isolation , away from the 38 other war crimes suspects from the former yugoslavia .
he is under 24-hour observation to ensure he does not attempt to kill himself - as both his parents did .
mr milosevic is accused of having ultimate responsibility for the mass deportation of 740,000 kosovo albanians and for the murder of hundreds of individually named albanians , said to have been committed by serb soldiers and militias .
further charges are also being drawn up against him relating to the wars in croatia and bosnia in the early 1990s which led to the break-up of the former yugoslavia .

heart disease claims around 10,000 lives every year .
heart disease in wales 10,000 deaths per year 20 % of the adult population need treatment for heart disease at some stage of their lives 75 % of patients who die from heart attacks do so before they reach hospital welsh health minister jane hutt will outline the national strategic framework at the welsh assembly in cardiff bay on tuesday , with a simultaneous launch taking place in mold in north wales .
however , both gps and hospital doctors fear staff shortages and a lack of resources could endanger the strategy before it gets off the ground .
prevention is seen as the key to tackling heart disease and doctors across wales are being asked to monitor patients .
the strategy provides five standards to improve patient care .
they will have to provide patients with a plan to reduce the risk themselves , using drugs , exercise , dieting and stopping smoking .
treatment needs to be faster for those who have a heart attack , with clot-busting drugs administered more quickly .

as a result , hospitals are struggling to acheive the targets ' inadequate resources ' family doctors have also said adequate resources must be provided if they are to play a crurial role in reducing the number of people who develop heart problems .
dr andrew jones of the saltmead medical centre in grangetown , cardiff , said : " the strategy is very nice and the ideals are very honourable , but in the real world we are struggling to cope with the pressures we face .
" the strategy will require us to look in to heart conditions with a much greater degree of detail .

this strategy requires extra staff on top of the basic sservice and if we ca n't recruit , that does cause concerns . "

the idea of the group came to morrison , born in florida in 1943 , when he was a student of theatre arts at the university of california in the early 1960s .
he sang a rudimentary composition to a college friend , the keyboardist ray manzarek , who was impressed enough to invite him to join the band rick and the ravens .
the group rehearsed half a dozen morrison compositions - alienating two of the musicians , who left - and started a residency in los angeles ' sunset strip under the name the doors .
morrison , characteristically , had found the name in aldous huxley 's account of drug experiences the doors of perception .
fired the group 's music was an experience , too - it ranged from the catchiness of light my fire to the chilling and dramatic the end .
it was the latter song that got the group fired from the whisky-a-go-go club , but they soon clinched a record deal thanks to the goods offices of fellow californian band love , who recommended them to elektra records .
their first album , released in 1967 , showed off the excellent musicianship of keyboardist manzarek and guitarist robbie krieger , and found morrison developing his unique vocal persona - half withdrawn , half menacing , wholly unforgettable .
the album 's light my fire was a number 1 hit in the us , though only grazed the british charts .
their following albums strange days and waiting for the sun , provided further american hits and , in hello i love you , a british number 15 .
but commercial success was decidedly double-edged for morrison .
intoxication the band was losing some of its credibility in the rock underground , which may have led the singer to feel obliged to behave more outrageously .
he was drinking and using drugs heavily and in 1969 he was arrested for indecent exposure , lewd conduct and public intoxication after a concert in miami 's dinner key auditorium .
though some of the charges were later dropped , the scandal made it hard for the band to work live for some time .
morrison used the crisis as a spur to creativity and produced one of the group 's best albums , morrison hotel , in 1970 .
literary career but morrison 's mind was elsewhere .
he had already published two volumes of poetry , the lords and the new creatures , and planned to begin a literary career once his contractual obligations to elektra were fulfilled .
his last record with the doors , la woman , was quite possibly their finest , and contained another defining track , the haunting riders on the storm .
but morrison himself was now in a steep physical decline .
escaping to paris while the band was still mixing la woman , he spoke of dropping music altogether and becoming a writer - but died in his bathtub - officially of a heart attack - on 3 july 1971 .
only his common law wife pamela courson -lrb- later a suicide -rrb- and an anonymous doctor saw the body , leaving the way clear for rock 's rumour machine to create the legend that morrison had faked his own death .
he is buried at père lachaise cemetery in paris , where his grave has become a shrine for successive generations of fans .
eerie since morrison 's death his records have never been out of print and his influence has been heard on a great many rock artists , including britain 's echo and the bunnymen , simple minds and the stranglers .
hollywood , too , has found the doors ' eerie music attractive .
the end was memorably used in francis ford coppola 's apocalypse now , and in 1991 oliver stone helped cement the morrison legend with his film biography the doors starring val kilmer .
the mainstream acceptance which had so disturbed morrison had arrived , and , so far at least , it has not gone away .
