lawyers for the herrera family from florida in the united states say the tyres caused the deaths of two members of the family a year ago .
the lawyers say ford , which made the explorer that they were driving , will also be sued .
it is the latest twist in the row between the two big companies over what caused a series of crashes involving the vehicles and the tyres .
' bad design ' firestone and ford have fallen out very publicly over a series of crashes which claimed 174 lives .
firestone said the cause was the bad design of ford 's popular explorer sports off-road vehicles , which the tyre company claimed had a greater tendency to turn over when tyres burst than did other vehicles .
ford , for its part , blamed the firestone tyres .
the result of the row is that a century-old trading relationship has been broken , with firestone refusing to sell tyres to ford - and ford saying it did not want to use them anyway .
now the lawyers and the politicians are involved .
the herrera family from fort lauderdale says firestone should be punished for the crash which claimed the lives of edelio herrera and his wife norma .
their son evelio said he felt angry with firestone because it killed his parents .
the family lawyers say ford will also be brought into the litigation .
congressional hearing the suit comes as ford 's chief excutive , jacques nasser , and firestone 's chief executive , john lampe , prepare to be questioned in congress .
the two men will not appear together at the hearing but one after the other .
that may diminish the theatre of the event , but not the importance .
firestone and ford are each trying to pin the blame on the other .
the cost of losing the public relations and the legal battle could run into billions of dollars .

the scottish parliament 's environment and transport committee has heard concerns that the publicly-owned caledonian macbrayne company might have to reduce its workforce .
there are also fears that safety could be compromised if more competition led to cheaper ferry crews being brought in .
the claims came when the committee took evidence on scottish executive proposals to put out ferry services in the highlands and islands to tender , a move made necessary by european rules on state aid for sea transport .
thousands rely on calmac services the scottish executive wants the service tendered as one package of routes , for which calmac and others would be able to bid .
unions and local authorities have warned of the danger of rival bidders " cherry-picking " lucrative services if the routes were split into several bundles .
tom kennedy of the transport and salaried staffs association told msps : " we have a real concern that the present terms and conditions of employment , never mind the jobs , will be under threat . "
he said calmac provided good services for its present level of subsidy and compared the prospect of putting the services out to tender with the reality of what had happened with rail privatisation .
his union represents 100 shore-based jobs in the western isles and it has fears for employment if caledonian macbrayne comes under more competitive pressure .
unions also voiced fears that the increased competition could lead to moves to bring in cheaper ferry crews unfamiliar with local sea conditions .
extraordinarily difficult norman martin , of the numast union and a calmac officer , told the inquiry he had worked for the company for more than 20 years and had never been asked to compromise on safety .
he said : " that is the sort of thing you ca n't quantify , but in the commercial world it 's a different ball game . "
he said waters in which the company operated were " extraordinarily difficult " and the ferry services were operated by crews who had long experience of dealing with them .
" i do n't suggest we are cleverer than anyone else , we are just exposed to it more . "
more competition calmac chairman dr harold mills told msps the company had wanted to be allowed to bid for the services as the operator , and was " delighted " this was the proposal which has been put to brussels by the executive .
he told the committee that what was being proposed for the ferry services was more competition , but not the " classic " model of privatisation .

wales suffers from higher than average levels of obesity , with the rates of heart disease correspondingly high and poor levels of general health .
the latest research carried out for the welsh consumer council uncovered what it called " startling evidence " about the amount of exercise and physical activity undertaken .
exercise in wales almost 70 % of people take some form of exercise only 29 % exercise enough to benefit health 31 % never take any exercise at all and while standards of public facilities vary greatly , the high cost of private health clubs was putting many people off taking up a more active lifestyle .
two thirds of people in wales take part in some form of physical recreation - but less than a third do enough exercise to benefit their health .
almost a third of the population never take part in any form of exercise - one of the reasons why half the population is classed as obese .
the council 's figures also show huge variation in the provision of leisure facilities across wales .
lack of information the council concluded that public leisure centres varied significantly with regard to opening times , prices , and the provision of activities and equipment .
it also found that , while private health clubs were on the increase , there was little information provided about them .
the survey indicated that private clubs were only used by a small percentage of the population .
more than one of five of those who did exercise said the main reason they did not use private facilities was because they were too expensive .
partnership the consumer council 's dr chris llewellyn said the provision of affordable facilities across wales needed to be reviewed .
" we ca n't have a situation where people 's access to facilities depends on the money they have at their disposal , " he said .
the council criticised the lack of any clear policy to promote individual exercise in wales it said there was a gap in health promotion policy that excluded those who were not already " sporty and fit " or who were not " sick and vulnerable . "
the council recommended that strategies to improve health through promoting increased exercise needed to take in place in partnership with the health authorities and social services as well as the leisure and fitness industry .
it called for a complete audit of both private and public leisure facilities to provide a breakdown of the nature and type of current exercise levels .
it also hoped to discover where and when exercise took place .
