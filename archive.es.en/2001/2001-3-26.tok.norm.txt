the meeting in edinburgh saw education conveners from all of scotland 's 32 local authorities pledging their support to the group and swapping ideas about how to beat the problem .
the meeting was part of the scottish executive 's attempt to improve behaviour among school pupils .
mr mcconnell has convened a task force to tackle the problem .
in its first meeting in january , the task force targeted primary school pupils in an effort to improve behaviour among the next generation of secondary school pupils .
mr mcconnell wants an improvement in secondary school pupils ' discipline - by targeting children in primary schools .
the task force is to form a long term strategy of promoting better self discipline among primary children - both inside and outside the classroom .
parents will also be encouraged to take greater responsibility for promoting good behaviour .
and in the shorter term , higher standards of behaviour will be set for secondary schools .
there will also be extra help to enable the schools and local authorities to meet these targets .
violent attacks teachers have been claiming for years that a small but disruptive minority has created a rising tide of indiscipline in scotland 's classrooms .
figures produced last month showed a significant rise in the number of reported violent attacks against teachers at scottish schools .
a total of 3,083 attacks on teachers , 1,880 of them violent , were recorded between august 1999 and august 2000 .
that represents a rise of 1,185 on the previous year - or more than 50 % .
more than 1,000 incidents involved primary school children and there were also 30 recorded attacks by under-fives .
the violence ranged from physical attacks , verbal abuse and damage to personal property .
almost 200 pupils were reported to the police as a result of all the incidents .
repeatedly disruptive more than one in 20 teachers were involved in an incident during the year , with 83.5 working days being recorded as lost as a result .
the minister said the discipline task group which he has set up would use the figures to inform their work .
scotland 's largest teaching union said pupil discipline in schools must be tackled if the new deal on teachers ' pay and conditions is to have any chance of success .
the educational institute of scotland -lrb- eis -rrb- said the mccrone agreement will only work if teachers are given the right to exclude repeatedly disruptive children .

the demonstrators have set up so-called resistance camps close to the railway line and are threatening to attack the tracks and stage sit-ins at strategic points .
a 17,000-strong police force is on high alert for potentially violent clashes with the anti-nuclear campaigners .
it is the first such shipment since 1997 , when pitched battles raged for days between riot police and protesters .
over the weekend , peaceful demonstrations were held along the route to the storage site .
the shipment left by rail from la hague in france at first light , and will cross the german border on monday night .
this normally quiet , rural corner of germany is now swarming with battle-ready police - their aim , to prevent thousands of anti-nuclear protesters from blocking the railway line leading to the town of dannenberg .
that is where the train from france is expected to deposit its cargo of six nuclear fuel containers late on tuesday .
the radioactive waste must then be loaded on to trucks for transfer by road to gorleben .
heated debate the well-organised activists face what is almost certainly the biggest post-war police operation mounted on german soil .
the looming battle at gorleben is the consequence of a highly-charged debate in germany about nuclear power .
last year , the coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a deal to phase out nuclear energy .
but the compromise reached with industry would allow some reactors to remain in service for more than 20 years - far too long for anti-nuclear hardliners .
while the government argues that germany has a moral duty to take back its reprocessed nuclear waste , opponents see disrupting the shipments as the most effective way of forcing an early shutdown of the industry .
it is thought germany will need to take back two shipments a year for at least the next decade .

bbc news online takes a look at his career .
there seems to be nothing to stop the rise of russell crowe .
less than a year after walking away with the best actor oscar for gladiator , he is again the toast of hollywood - and looks firmly on course for another academy award .
in just a few years , the new zealand-born actor has gone from a virtual unknown to becoming one of the hottest properties in the film-making world .
crowe 's talent would seem to lie in his professional versatility and courage .
in recent times , each role he has taken on has been in vast contrast to the last .
a beautiful mind 's central character - nobel prize-winning mathematician john nash - could not be further from gladiator 's steely hero maximus .
as maximus , crowe was allowed to be charismatic in the truly macho sense .
as nash , crowe proves he is not afraid to appear in a less glamorous guise .
in 2000 , crowe won an oscar nomination for the dignity with which he acted out his role in the insider .
he played middle-aged tobacco industry whistleblower jeffrey wigand , a role for which he piled on the pounds and made his hair grey .
but though crowe 's star is very much in the ascendancy he is not an overnight sensation .
now aged 37 , crowe has done his time .
before he came to prominence , he had been in a rock band , worked on stage and in tv and appeared in 20 films .
a glance at his full career shows his depth and versatility , from playing a brutal thug in romper stomper to a gentler character in proof of life .
rock ' n ' roll russell crowe was born in auckland , new zealand on 7 april 1964 , descended from a norwegian and maori ancestry .
his family moved to sydney , australia , when he was four .
his parents , jocelyn and alex crowe , did the catering on movie sets and often took their young son with them to work .
russell crowe films blood oath - 1990 proof - 1991 romper stomper - 1992 sum of us - 1994 virtuosity - 1995 the insider - 1999 gladiator - 2000 proof of life - 2001 crowe was bitten with the acting bug from an early age and made his debut as a child extra at the age of six .
his first professional acting role was in an episode of the tv series spyforce .
but at 14 , crowe decided to leave both acting and australia behind .
he finished high school and returned to new zealand where he formed the band roman antix with friend dean cochran .
at 16 , he called himself russ le roq and recorded several songs , including the prophetic i want to be like marlon brando .
his band eventually evolved into the rock ' n ' roll outfit 30 odd foot of grunts , for which he still writes and performs .
during his time as a young musician , crowe took on several odd jobs , including that of waiter and bingo caller .
but the acting bug bit again and crowe won a role in a stage version of grease and then the rocky horror show .
after moving back to australia , he also appeared in soap opera neighbours .
awards crowe 's first movie was blood oath in 1990 .
he continued to gain momentum with films such as the crossing when he was 25 .
he then went on give an australian film institute award-winning performance in black comedy proof , playing the friend of a blind man .
this was followed by the critically acclaimed romper stomper , in which he played neo-nazi hondo and won another australian film institute award .
crowe was now on a roll since this performance got him noticed - particularly by hollywood actress sharon stone .
basic instinct star stone was adamant that crowe could play alongside her in the western the quick and the dead as the priest cort .
the movie was a flop but it got crowe into hollywood , and onwards and upwards to greater things .
virtuosity with denzel washington followed , as well as smaller films with equally big names such as salma hayek and bridget fonda .
versatility but it was the box office hit la confidential in 1997 that made the difference .
crowe played the complex bud white , described by crowe as " racist , self-righteous and foul-mouthed but who does n't realise how much he 's looking for love " .
the film won its star kim basinger an oscar and crowe was rewarded with an abundance of offers and scripts .
one of these was michael mann 's tense thriller the insider .
as wigand , crowe played a man who informed on the corrupt practices of his tobacco firm .
but if the insider showed crowe 's maturity and conviction as a serious actor , it was gladiator that created the " cult " of russell crowe as action hero .
it was followed by proof of life with meg ryan .
again crowe played a tough ex-sas soldier turned kidnap-negotiator .
it is was another tense thriller but one combining one of the strongest sides of crowe 's on-screen persona - action hero and strategist .
in a beautiful mind , crowe develops his skills in playing characters with mental , more than physical , strength .
future projects include circus drama flora plum , directed by jodie foster , which again should stretch his capability and range .
