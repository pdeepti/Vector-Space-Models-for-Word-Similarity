the three , named as former generals mehmed alagic and enver hadzihasanovic , and a serving brigadier , amir kubura , were arrested on thursday at the tribunal 's request .
there are no details as yet of the charges they will face , but a government statement said the indictments related to their " command responsibility in the war period " .
earlier , icty spokeswoman florence hartmann said that un chief war crimes prosecutors had presented the bosnian government with several sealed indictments , but refused to reveal their number or the identities of those concerned .
the arrests came as bosnian serb general radislav krstic was convicted of genocide for his role in the 1995 murder of almost 8,000 muslim men and boys in srebrenica .
' delicate ' operation the three men were arrested at their homes by plain-clothes police , mr alagic in the northern town of sanski most and the other two in the capital sarajevo .
this is the first time local police in bosnia have arrested their own people .
the commander-in-chief of the bosnian army , atif dudakovic , described the operation as delicate and painful .
the bosnian government has consistently promised full co-operation with the tribunal , including the handover of suspects .
' isolated incidents ' bosnian muslim commentators say that some war crimes were committed by the majority muslim bosnian army during the war .
but they say that these were isolated incidents and not the planned genocide of which they have accused the bosnian serb and bosnian croat armies .
correspondents say generals hadzihasanovic and alagic are the highest-ranking bosnian muslims to be transferred to the hague .
two others , hazim delic and esad landzo , have already been convicted by the tribunal .
they were sentenced to 20 years and 15 years respectively for crimes against bosnian serbs in celebici , in central bosnia .
handover call parliament in the other entity in bosnia , the serb republic , recently approved the first draft of a law on co-operation , but the authorities there have yet to arrest any of the indictees believed to be living on their territory .
on thursday un prosecutors called for the immediate handover of the former bosnian serb leader , radovan karadzic , and his military commander , ratko mladic - both indicted by the tribunal but still at large .
the call followed general krstic 's sentencing to 46 years for his part in the srebrenica massacre .
during his trial , krstic said he was acting on the orders of other generals .
he plans to appeal against the decision .
it was the court 's first conviction for genocide - the most serious of war crimes - in connection with the bosnia war , and the toughest sentence it has passed so far .
the massacre in the muslim enclave of srebrenica - a designated un safe haven - is regarded as europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii .
krstic , 53 , is the first senior official linked with the massacre to be tried by the tribunal in the hague .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- gold teeth are a gold mine categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 3 august , 2001 , 04:51 gmt 05:51 uk gold teeth are a gold mine removable gold teeth are " the style " for followers of hip-hop culture by bbc news online 's north america business reporter , david schepp with cable television 's music television -lrb- mtv -rrb- celebrating its 20th anniversary , there is perhaps no better time to examine the latest fad influenced by music videos .
diamond-encrusted removable teeth have also proven popular gold teeth - specifically removable gold teeth - have emerged as the latest fashion trend among devotees to hip-hop and rap , styles of music common among 20-somethings across urban america .
worn by legions of rap stars and their fans , gold teeth , or " fronts " as they are called can be as simple or as ornate as the wearer desires .
long a statement within black culture , gold teeth have moved beyond their depression-era southern roots into mainstream american society .
ground zero along fulton mall in brooklyn - what some consider to be ground zero for this latest craze - several shops , including golden sparkle and lora 's fine jewellery cater to an ever-growing number of people who want to be noticed for their dazzling smiles .
shoppers along fulton mall in brooklyn can shop for gold teeth , too one young man told the bbc he liked wearing his gold teeth because it is " cool " and because everyone else is doing it .
" right now , i 'm in the best shape of my life , " he said .
" i got to wear my fronts to attract the girls .
i got to have my mouth shining . "
others see it merely as a style choice .
another young man , sporting four lower gold-capped teeth said the fad said something about fashion in the new century .
" everybody 's dress code is strange .
we wear big hats , big pants , " he said , adding that he paid about $ 130 for his teeth .
today 's gold teeth are far more sophisticated then the ones worn to replace missing or damaged teeth in the past .
while some rap-music stars have gone so far as to have their gold teeth permanently attached to existing teeth , most folks opt for removable gold teeth .
off-hours statement for soccer moms and professionals who want to sport a hip-hop look for clubbing but a more reserved look for work or social functions , removable gold teeth provide a workable medium , providing them gold-lined smiles when they feel comfortable displaying them .
the ability to put on and take out gold teeth at-will is key to the success of ventures such as bridgeport international , a georgia manufacturer of removable gold teeth .
" what 's nice , " bridgeport contends , " is that you can insert the caps and remove them as you wish . "
bridgeport makes caps that are custom made to fit an individual 's teeth .
the caps are guaranteed to fit and give the appearance of permanent teeth .
the average cost runs around $ 50 a tooth .
but a set of diamond encrusted fronts can cost $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 .
bridgeport has seen its business explode in recent years as the gold-tooth phenomenon has taken hold .
surge in popularity david baldwin , a designer for bridgeport , says he has seen orders rise from about 15 to 45 sets a week to 300 to 500 sets a day - all attributable to current fads in popular music .
" rap music has definitely played a major part in gold teeth , " mr baldwin said , adding that gold teeth have been around for eons .
" but the removable and diamond-encrusted teeth are the thing . "
in addition he said he could trace a surge in request for gold vampire teeth to a video by the hip hop band wu tang clan , in which one of the performers wore the gold-toned fangs .
shortly after the debut of the video , requests for fang teeth went through the roof , he said .
mr baldwin , who calls his products " jewellery for teeth " , said his clientele , too , have changed over the years to include suburbanites .
white rap artist eminem 's appeal to suburban youth has further encouraged the general acceptance of the gold-tooth craze .
as mr baldwin said , " it 's definitely mainstream now . "

a report from the national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- said the bill 's proposed consumer panel should be " proactive and empowered " .
the report - plugging the panel - was issued on friday and aims to put " flesh on the bones " of the panel proposed by the government 's paper , published in december .
in the paper , the government set out its plans for the digital age of broadcasting and telecommunications , principally streamlining the media watchdogs into one body called ofcom .
in respect of those areas where ofcom does cover the bbc , it will of course look at what the panel says bbc spokeswoman with regards to the bbc , it said governors should continue to act as a watchdog for the corporation 's activities .
the consumer panel would then be able to put their complaints to ofcom if they felt the bbc had not done enough .
a spokesman for the bbc said : " we are constantly looking at improving our contact with different audiences and ensuring that the organisation is externally , consumer focused .
" in respect of those areas where ofcom does cover the bbc , it will of course look at what the panel says . "
ofcom could have a say in some of the bbc 's content and production obligations like news in peak periods , independent programming quota and regional production quota .
' narrow ' december 's white paper said the consumer panel , set up by the government , should report to ofcom - due to be set up by 2003 .
it would be independently appointed , and publish its findings and advice .
but the ncc 's director anna bradley said the ncc considered the proposed remit of the panel too " narrow " .
she added : " to do its job properly , it -lrb- the panel -rrb- must be able to comment on broad content issues .
" the communications revolution is offering exciting new services for consumers .
" a strong consumer voice is needed to influence developments in this crucial area .
" the panel should seek to influence all the players in the market who impact on consumers .
its remit should certainly extend to the bbc . "
' helpful ' in plugging the panel , the ncc said it wanted the consumer panel to be well resourced .
this would allow it access to high quality panel members and staff , and regulatory and industry information .
it added that the panel should also be able to set its own agenda .
the report was welcomed by the department of culture , media and sport -lrb- dcms -rrb- .
a dcms spokeswoman said : " this is a helpful contribution to the public debate on the communications white paper .
" we shall consider the report carefully as we prepare the draft communications bill for publication later this year or early next year . "
she added the panel would act as a sounding-board for issues concerning broadcasters , including the bbc .

general krstic : the hague tribunal 's first genocide conviction by south-east europe analyst gabriel partos the trial of general radislav krstic has been by far the most important case to have been heard by the hague tribunal so far - and for several reasons .
it has dealt with the 1995 srebrenica massacre - the killings of more than 7,000 muslim men and boys - which is widely regarded as the worst single atrocity in europe since the end of world war ii .
it may well be that the tribunal wants to keep life imprisonment in reserve it involved a general - only the second to have been put in the dock up to now .
and it secured the hague tribunal 's first conviction of a defendant for genocide - a charge the united nations geneva convention of 1948 defines as " acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group " .
previous convictions by the tribunal have involved charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
those charges arose out of ethnic cleansing in its many forms - killings , torture , systematic rape and forcible expulsions .
handful but this time the three-member panel of judges ruled that at srebrenica ethnic cleansing became genocide .
the judges took the view that , in deciding to kill all muslim men of fighting age - while deporting the entire population of women , old people and children - general krstic and his associates intended to make it impossible for muslims , as a community , to survive in srebrenica .
in srebrenica , ethnic cleansing became genocide six years after the srebrenica killings - and five-and-a-half after the dayton peace accords which specified that refugees must be allowed to return to their homes - only a handful of muslim survivors have been able to go back to srebrenica .
the scale of the srebrenica tragedy - and the first-ever genocide conviction at the hague - account for the 46-year prison term the judges have imposed on general krstic .
it is the longest sentence meted out to any of the defendants .
previously , the harshest punishment - 45 years - had been given to general tihomir blaskic , a bosnian croat commander .
he had been convicted of the killings of bosnian muslims in central bosnia - atrocities , which though horrific , had produced hundreds , rather than thousands of victims .
so the tribunal now appears to have wanted to make it clear that general krstic 's guilt was even greater than that of general blaskic .
life imprisonment at the same time the judges have not accepted the prosecution 's demand for consecutive terms of life imprisonment on each of the charges - which is the tribunal 's most severe penalty in the absence of capital punishment .
ratko mladic : the tribunal may be saving a life term for those who allegedly gave the orders it may well be that the tribunal wants to keep life imprisonment in reserve for those considered ultimately most responsible for the worst crimes .
in the case of srebrenica , that is expected to be kept in reserve for the bosnian serbs ' wartime military commander , general ratko mladic and his political master , radovan karadzic - if they are found guilty at trial .
with the guilty verdicts on the genocide charges , the hague tribunal has now followed its counterpart in arusha which has already convicted several rwandan officials involved in the massacres of 1994 .
the question that remains for the tribunal is just how long it will take before general mladic and mr karadzic are brought to trial .
until that happens , many bosnian survivors of ethnic cleansing will find it difficult to come to terms with their tragedy - even if some now find it reassuring that at least one war crimes suspect has been found guilty of genocide .

anderson , who wrote futuristic tales with a moral edge , was a former president of the science fiction and fantasy writers of america and winner of three nebula awards and seven hugo awards .
many scientists have told him that they got their start by reading not just science fiction , but his science fiction karen anderson last month his novel genesis won the john w campbell award for the best science fiction novel of the year for 2000 .
he was remembered by his wife karen anderson , who wrote with him , as a writer of books that expanded from simple observation of the world .
" they showed the importance of honour and courage , the wonder of the universe and knowing about it through science , " she said .
" many scientists have told him that they got their start by reading not just science fiction , but his science fiction . "
he was known for his scientific accuracy , but had not embraced technology himself , according to his wife .
" he used a typewriter up until last fall , always being too busy on the next story to learn how to use computers , " she said .
anderson developed story sequences over the year , exploring future histories for the earth in the aftermath of nuclear war or the first forays into time travel and space exploration .
one of his first efforts , the novel brain wave , imagined what would happen on earth if humans and animals all experienced a sudden evolution in intelligence .
other noted works included tao zero , midsummer tempest , the boat of a million years and the enemy stars .
in a 1997 interview anderson said he sought to push the notion of what is possible .
" so much american science fiction is parochial - not as true now as it was years ago , but the assumption is one culture in the future , more or less like ours and with the same ideals , the same notions of how to do things , just bigger and flashier technology , " he said .
" well you know darn well it does n't work that way . "
anderson was born in pennsylvania in 1926 , grew up in minnesota and texas and published his first story in 1947 which a student at the university of minnesota .
he moved to the san francisco area in the 1950s and has since been a prolific writer of novels and short stories .
