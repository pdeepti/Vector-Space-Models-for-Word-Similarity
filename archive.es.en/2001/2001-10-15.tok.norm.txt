trustees of the pension fund of unilever , the consumer products giant , want £ 130m in compensation from the us-owned investment house merrill lynch .
they claim merrill lynch was negligent in the way it managed more than £ 1bn from unilever 's pension fund between 1996 and 1998 .
merrill lynch has said the claim is groundless .
the battle has caught the city 's imagination because it pits two of the city 's most powerful women against each other .
inherited dispute merrill lynch inherited the dispute when it bought mercury asset management -lrb- mam -rrb- for £ 3.1bn in 1997 - a takeover that made millions for the two executives who then ran mercury 's hugely successful investment operation , stephen zimmerman and carol galley .
since the 1970s , most of the country 's biggest pension funds entrusted their assets to mam , which built a reputation for excellence in making high returns .
by the late 1990s , mam was managing around £ 100bn of assets and exercised considerable power as a major shareholder in britain 's leading companies .
ms galley was nicknamed " the ice queen " of the city after using mam 's shareholdings to clinch granada 's hostile takeover bid for the forte hotels group .
earlier this year , she departed from merrill lynch to pursue other interests .
below target in 1996 unilever 's pension fund - whose chief operating officer wendy mayall is another of the city 's most successful female executives - negotiated terms for mam to manage more than £ 1bn .
mam 's success at investing the money would be measured against an agreed " benchmark " based on the growth of a basket of uk and us shares .
the fund manager agreed to try to beat the benchmark by 1 % and to avoid under-performing it by more than 3 % .
in 1997 , mam fell way behind its target .
it had invested the money defensively in sectors such as building materials when other asset managers had more of their money on banks , insurers and pharmaceuticals .
after a few months it was more than 10 % beneath its target .
in spite of attempts to correct its performance , mam finished by undershooting its target by 8 % .
sacked in early 1998 , unilever sacked mam as a fund manager .
and in 1999 , unilever announced its intention to pursue its claim against mam .
unilever claims mam took on too much risk in its investment decisions - more than its contract with the pension fund would imply - and is claiming negligence .
mam denies the claim .
if unilever wins , further legal actions will be launched , with serious implications for the city 's highly-paid fund managers .
they are already under fire for their lack of success in beating the performance of passive " tracker funds " which use computers to mimic the movements of the ftse-100 and ftse all share indices .
mam and other fund managers point out that it is in the nature of fund management for successful fund managers to go through periods of under-performance .
they also believe it is unfair to judge a fund managers performance over a short period - especially when they are expected to take a long-term view of prospects .
ramifications lawyers believe that if fund managers can be sued for poor investment decisions - as well as sacked - it may boost the coffers of pension funds , but would ultimately force fund managers to charge more .
robin ellison , a prominent pensions lawyer with the city legal firm eversheds , says : " if this battle goes to the bitter end then it will change the way city fund managers operate .
" if they think they can be sued then pension funds might benefit in the short term .
but fund managers will be more reluctant to take the sort of risks in their investment decisions that they have to take to perform well .
" and their charges may go up because they 'll have to cover legal costs when they did n't have to before . "
the two parties may ask the high court to adjourn the case if they believe an out-of-court settlement is possible .
but so far , all attempts at settlement have failed .
if a settlement involves a substantial sum - tens of millions of pounds - then other pension funds may still feel obliged to follow with their own legal actions .

crossair - a regional airline operating small commuter planes - now owns 70 % of swissair .
the crossair board is weighing its options , while swiss government officials have been meeting bankers to round up financial backing for any rescue deal .
crossair executives have warned that up to 27,000 jobs could go , and outlined the need for multi-billion dollar subsidies .
at the beginning of the month , swissair was forced to file for bankruptcy , overwhelmed by the weight of debt accumulated during a disastrous expansion programme .
the global slump in air travel following the terror attacks in the united states in september finally pushed swissair over the brink .
three options swissair is still flying for now .
a 450m swiss franc aid package provided by the government will keep its planes in the air until 28 october .
but under a rescue deal backed by two swiss banks - ubs and credit suisse - crossair was taken away from swissair and is now set to take over its former parent company .
it will keep some of swissair 's planes and staff , and rebrand what remains of the airline under its own name .
meeting bankers and government officials on sunday , crossair chairman andre dose outlined three options for swissair : option 1 : crossair takes over 52 of swissair 's plane - half flying european routes , the other half serving intercontinental services .
mr dose believes he would need 4bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 2.4bn -rrb- to make this work .
9,400 jobs would be lost .
option 2 : crossair keeps 26 short-haul jets to fly european routes , and 15 intercontinental planes .
14,500 jobs would be lost .
the carrier would require financial backing to the tune of about 2.85bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 1.65bn -rrb- .
option 3 : crossair does not take over swiss air , leaving 27,000 workers without a job at a cost of 2.7bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 1.65bn -rrb- in severance payments .
crossair will now investigate all three options , and its decision will depend on how much money it can raise from investors and the swiss government .
swiss government officials are hesitant to stump up more money , fearing that they might end up footing much of a bill that could add to as much as 4bn swiss franc .
the government will be meeting on wednesday to weigh the options laid out by crossair .
the bank consortium led by ubs and swissair has put up 1.4bn swiss franc so far , but this money has mainly gone to extricate crossair from the collapse of swissair group .
but swissair needs about $ 120m every month just to keep going , and some of its key subsidiaries responsible for things like plane maintenance and ground handling are running out of cash fast .
rights to routes in doubt the situation has been complicated by switzerland 's federal civil aviation authority , which has warned that crossair may not be allowed to take over swissair 's long-haul routes immediately .
the licences could not be re-assigned to another carrier before march next year , the regulator said .
mr dose has already said that crossair is unlikely to take on swissair 's intercontinental flights for at least five months , which would make government funding even more urgent .

crossair - a regional airline operating small commuter planes - now owns 70 % of swissair .
the crossair board is weighing its options , while swiss government officials have been meeting bankers to round up financial backing for any rescue deal .
crossair executives have warned that up to 27,000 jobs could go , and outlined the need for multi-billion dollar subsidies .
at the beginning of the month , swissair was forced to file for bankruptcy , overwhelmed by the weight of debt accumulated during a disastrous expansion programme .
the global slump in air travel following the terror attacks in the united states in september finally pushed swissair over the brink .
three options swissair is still flying for now .
a 450m swiss franc aid package provided by the government will keep its planes in the air until 28 october .
but under a rescue deal backed by two swiss banks - ubs and credit suisse - crossair was taken away from swissair and is now set to take over its former parent company .
it will keep some of swissair 's planes and staff , and rebrand what remains of the airline under its own name .

a multi-million pound experiment with summer literacy and numeracy lessons for pupils lagging behind at secondary schools led to less than half reaching level 4 , according to a study by academics at king 's college , london -lrb- kcl -rrb- .
professor margaret brown , who led the research , said that the figures were estimates and the actual proportion could have been as low as 15 % .
she said the problem was the targets set by ministers , not the classes themselves .
programme extended the lessons were piloted in 200 schools which were each given £ 10,000 to run summer sessions as part of the government 's drive to ensure that children do not regress between the ages of 11 and 14 .
the programme is now being extended to all comprehensives in england .
but the kcl research , based on an evaluation of 30 of the schools in 17 english local education authorities , showed that less than half the pupils reached the required standard even with the extra help .
those who did tended to be near the top of the level 3 band in national tests for 11-year-olds or reached level 4 by improving their writing .
professor brown said the children obliged to attend the catch-up classes were likely to have been those singled out for remedial work earlier in their school careers .
by the age of 11 , their motivation was likely to drop after years of being identified as low achievers , she said .
but instead of concentrating on what they could realistically achieve , teachers had been forced by the targets to try to boost attainment beyond what was possible .
' scrap targets ' " all our figures show that there 's a seven-year spread in the attainment range and it is quite unrealistic to expect most of them to suddenly get up to level 4 .
" scrapping some of the targets would help because some of the teachers felt frustrated that they were going to be judged on not getting children up to level 4 when they had worked terribly hard with them . "
professor brown , a former member of the task force that helped draw up the national numeracy strategy , said it would be better to measure the improvement in each child 's points scores for english and maths .
a spokesman for the department for education and employment said : " supporting children who need extra help in the first year of secondary education is a central priority .
" catch-up provision has been trialled and we have refined it in the light of this for the national introduction . "

peter finlay , 51 , from bristol , denies the manslaughter of jonathan attwell , 10 , two years ago .
mr finlay is accused of failing to ensure the safety of the boy , who died during a trek on the mountain in october 1999 .
jonathan , who was also from bristol , fell 500 feet to his death while descending snowdon 's difficult east ridge .
the trial has heard the scout was left at the back of the group to pick his way down alone , although he was the youngest of 12 on the trip .
when he lost contact with the others , it is alleged , he took a wrong turn which led to a steep drop .
earlier in the trial peter finlay told the jury the trip was one of many he had organised since becoming involved with the scouts in 1986 .
he rejected claims that jonathan fell because he had been left alone .
mr finlay has also told the court of his " panic and shock " when he realised a member of the group had gone missing .
he said he could not believe a young boy " could have vanished and fallen off the edge " .
mr finlay described the troop as " full of life " when they reached the summit of snowdon during the expedition .
in earlier evidence , the court heard from a snowdonia national park senior warden , who claimed the route was unsuitable for inexperienced walkers .
sam roberts , who was on the mountain when the incident happened , said attempting the east ridge descent with inexperienced climbers was akin to throwing someone learning to swim into the deep end of a pool .

the south armagh farmers ' and residents ' committee -lrb- safrc -rrb- said its case had been strengthened by a european ruling aimed at grounding flights overnight between 1800 bst and 1000 bst at london 's heathrow airport .
anti-noise campaigners who live near the airport won the case in the european court of human rights , which ruled that their rights were being violated by night flights to and from the airport - one of the busiest in the world .
now the south armagh residents are to petition newry and mourne district council for financial backing to bring a similar case over military helicopters .
" of late , we have received numerous complaints about day and night-time flying from residents throughout the south armagh area , " said the group .
" particular concern is voiced over the amount of helicopters ferrying cargo from bessbrook military barracks to the bases and joint british army / ruc barracks in crossmaglen and forkhill .
" it is believed that building supplies are being brought into the bases as construction work and refurbishment is visible . "
safrc was established in 1997 to campaign for the withdrawal of british troops and removal of observation posts from south armagh .
the heliport in bessbrook in south armagh is thought to be one of the busiest in europe .
the committee is expected to hand its petition to councillors on monday .

the central bank 's bleak assessment was its fifth downgrading of the country 's economic prospects in as many months .
corporate bankruptcies , meanwhile , are surging , while exports are plummeting according to data published on monday .
japan is in a severe recession , with the rate of unemployment at a record 5 % .
the bank predicted the " the substantial decline in production " would have " a negative influence on employment and income conditions " .
corporate debt quadruples as the economy stays mired in the worst of economic nightmares - no or little growth and falling prices - japanese companies are going bust in ever larger numbers .
according to research firm teikoku databank , bankruptcy cases rose 4.4 % during september .
corporate debt surged to 3.13 trillion yen -lrb- $ 26bn -rrb- , four times the sum recorded a year ago .
the figures were inflated by the collapse of mycal , one of japan 's largest supermarket chains .
according to teikoku , these data do not yet take into account any impact of the us attacks .
trade surplus plummets japan 's export industry , meanwhile , is finding it more and more difficult to compete .
the country 's current account surplus - which measures the flow of goods , services and financial transfers - fell 27.1 % compared to september last year .
and compared to august this year , the surplus dropped 37 % .
according to the bank of japan , " net exports -lrb- real exports minus real imports -rrb- continue to decline , reflecting not only a slowdown in overseas economies but also sluggish demand for it-related goods " .
but it is not only exporters who are suffering .
imports are down as well , hit by a weakening yen and slowing domestic demand , according to officials at the finance ministry .
once the economic slowdown in the united states has spread to asia , things are likely to get worse , economists predict .
" production activities in asia are mainly supported by us demand ...

the central bank 's bleak assessment was its fifth downgrading of the country 's economic prospects in as many months .
corporate bankruptcies , meanwhile , are surging , while exports are plummeting according to data published on monday .
japan is in a severe recession , with the rate of unemployment at a record 5 % .
the bank predicted the " the substantial decline in production " would have " a negative influence on employment and income conditions " .
corporate debt quadruples as the economy stays mired in the worst of economic nightmares - no or little growth and falling prices - japanese companies are going bust in ever larger numbers .
according to research firm teikoku databank , bankruptcy cases rose 4.4 % during september .
corporate debt surged to 3.13 trillion yen -lrb- $ 26bn -rrb- , four times the sum recorded a year ago .
the figures were inflated by the collapse of mycal , one of japan 's largest supermarket chains .
according to teikoku , these data do not yet take into account any impact of the us attacks .
trade surplus plummets japan 's export industry , meanwhile , is finding it more and more difficult to compete .
the country 's current account surplus - which measures the flow of goods , services and financial transfers - fell 27.1 % compared to september last year .
and compared to august this year , the surplus dropped 37 % .
according to the bank of japan , " net exports -lrb- real exports minus real imports -rrb- continue to decline , reflecting not only a slowdown in overseas economies but also sluggish demand for it-related goods " .
but it is not only exporters who are suffering .
imports are down as well , hit by a weakening yen and slowing domestic demand , according to officials at the finance ministry .
once the economic slowdown in the united states has spread to asia , things are likely to get worse , economists predict .
" production activities in asia are mainly supported by us demand ...
i imagine the current account figures in september and october will be impacted by the attacks ... in the united states , " said makoto ishikawa at japan research institute .

but the report argues that there remain plentiful opportunities for corrupt behaviour , and some of the prevailing economic policies of recent years may well have made things worse .
the survey - the global corruption report 2001 - is published by transparency international , a private anti-corruption watchdog body set up in 1993 .
it says that increasingly , and in many countries around the world , corrupt behaviour is being dragged out of the shadows .
steps forward in india , high-level military and governmental officials have been caught on camera allegedly soliciting and accepting bribes for arms contracts .
in france , top-level politicians are in court facing criminal charges over the elf aquitaine scandal .

and in mexico , 70 years of corrupt rule by the institutional revolutionary party -lrb- pri -rrb- was ended by a new president , vicente fox .
new commitments according to ti , these developments and others have come about because of an increasing public commitment by some politicians and international bodies to fighting corruption , as well as by increased efforts by the media to spotlight the problem .
that has impacted the private sector in a big way , ti says .
where before the payment of bribes by firms was glossed over , and banks ' tacit connivance in money laundering - a vital part of getting the proceeds of corruption out of the country concerned - ignored , the pressure is now growing .
ti points to the movement towards a labelling system to cut down on the number of " conflict diamonds " from places like sierra leone and angola making their way unheeded onto the market .
the oecd 's anti-bribery convention has helped , ti says , although some countries - notably the uk - have yet to bring its stipulations into domestic law .
and civil society in some countries is gaining strength .
stumbling blocks but much more work is needed , the report says , particularly in areas such as party funding , institutional development and government procurement .
in germany , the scandals of the past two years involving the christian democrat party - in power throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s - demonstrate the insidious tendency of political parties to fund themselves through favour-broking and kickbacks .
thailand 's prime minister , thaksin shinawatra , only narrowly avoided a court probe into alleged corruption and vote-buying .
and in the us , the whirlwind - if ultimately unsuccessful - presidential campaign of senator john mccain was largely built on opposition to what many americans see as graft by much of the political class .
worse , where anti-corruption efforts are instituted , they can be undermined either through insufficient independence or by being used to settle political scores .
it is only in the past few weeks that south african anti-corruption investigators have been able to penetrate ruling party opposition and question senior government figures about a huge alleged arms procurement scandal .
procurement is a universal problem , ti points out , and similar cases can be found across the world .
kenya 's anti-corruption force was declared unconstitutional by the supreme court .
and in vietnam , most accusations of corruption have come from the prime minister , and most of the accused are his political opponents .
private sector responsibility businesses , too , need to do more , ti says , quoting its own " bribe payers ' index " which shows that numerous multinational firms are still happy to bribe foreign officials to get what they want .
and the wholesale liberalisation and privatisation required of developing countries as a condition for receiving aid has often exacerbated the problem .
without proper oversight , privatisations have too often been decided on the basis of whose sweeteners are best , not who provides the best deal for the country and its population .

his latest challenge is bringing the comic book superhero spider-man to life in a film due out next may .
as visual effects supervisor for columbia pictures , mr dykstra says he has to always push the boundaries of what is possible .
" you have to promise the producer more than you know how to produce , " he says .
" because , by the time you do the film , if your promises were laid on a foundation of known technology , you 're already obsolete . "
