the government 's disaster response centre said the victims had either drowned , been buried under landslides or been electrocuted by fallen power lines .
at least 20 other people are missing after the typhoon turned the roads of the taiwanese capital , taipei , into torrents of water .
president chen shui-bian toured the worst affected areas on an amphibious armoured vehicle as more than 10,000 people were evacuated from sections of northern and central taiwan .
most of the victims were in the north of the island where nari struck on monday .
the typhoon is moving but heavy rainfall is still expected over southern taiwan .
rescuers are continuing to dig through mud and rocks which crashed into houses and more bodies are expected to be found .
mr chen said : " the search must not stop until all the people classed as missing are found . "
about 8,000 soldiers have been deployed to help with the rescue and clean-up operations .
more than 650,000 households suffered power and water cuts , and telephone lines to about 360,000 households in northern taiwan were also hit , it said .
the central weather bureau said there had been up to 1,255 millimetres -lrb- about 50 inches -rrb- of rainfall in some areas in the past two days .
swollen rivers officials said rainfall on monday of up to 800 millimetres in some places was the most in a single day since records began 70 years ago .
that is more rain than normally falls in four months .
the floods hit a slowing economy already likely to suffer fallout from the disruption caused to the us economy by last week 's terror strikes .
taiwan is traditionally typhoon prone but has been particularly hard hit this year .
two months ago typhoon toraji struck central taiwan causing landslides and flash floods which killed more than 100 people .
it also caused widespread damage to agriculture and property .

devon county council 's school travel plan co-ordinator , alison mcgregor , said : " it will allow us to see just how many children walk to school , how many cycle and how many come by car or public transport .
" that will allow us to target our resources more effectively . "
as well as reshaping the approach to school transport , devon county council hopes to address parents ' concerns about their children 's journey to school .
" many parents cite safety and security as reasons why they drive their children to school but there are ways of overcoming their fears , " said alison mcgregor .
" for example , a ' walking bus ' allows children to walk to school in a group , supervised by parents , in a safe way .
" we will also be highlighting the health benefits of walking and cycling .
" hopefully , this whole exercise will have educational , health and environmental benefits . "
john stocker middle school in exeter is one of the schools that will be conducting the survey .
all 400 pupils will be asked to raise their hands in answer to questions at the school 's morning assembly .

the news came as boeing , the world 's biggest jet maker , announced it would be slashing 20,000-30,000 jobs by the end of next year as airlines cut flight schedules and aircraft orders .

" we anticipate that in the next few days , revenue would probably be operating at no more than 40 % to 50 % of normal , " mr mullin said .

taiwan 's entry terms were agreed in 1999 but the island has had to wait for china to complete its entry talks to the international trade body .
this is a major victory in the 12-year taiwanese campaign to join the group that sets rules for global commerce lin hsin-yi taiwan 's application received approval on tuesday , a day after china 's admission to the wto was cleared .
taiwan 's economics minister , lin hsin-yi , greeted the decision as the " great hope of the nation 's people " .
beijing and taipei will now have to adopt wto rules stipulating that all members must treat each other 's goods and services equally .
however within the wto , taiwan will be known as " chinese taipei " and described as a " separate customs territory " to accomodate beijing 's view that taiwan is part of china .
unlike china , taiwan 's economy will be classified as that of a developed country .
both china and taiwan are expected to be formally approved for membership at a wto ministerial conference in qatar in november .
trade vs politics direct trade , transport and postal links between mainland china and taiwan have been banned since taiwan broke away in 1949 .
minister lin : trade with china will increase under wto free trade agreements , banning trade with china would violate the organisation 's most-favoured-nation principle , which means all members must extend equal treatment to each other 's goods and service providers .
taiwan 's economics minister said he expected limits on chinese goods allowed into taiwan would be relaxed step-by-step .
mr lin said wto membership would also help taiwan export goods to its neighbour .
for its part , china still regards taiwan as a breakaway province that must be brought back under its rule and it claims that trade disputes are domestic matters and not subject to international agreements .
quite how beijing and taipei plan to solve such difficulties within the framework of the wto is as yet unclear .
the wto has forecast tariff relaxation by taiwan to all wto members will create " a market for imports equivalent to roughly $ 1bn " once cuts in duty are fully implemented .
taiwan will cut import tariffs on industrial goods from 6.03 % to 5.78 % and on agricultural goods from 20.02 % to 14.01 % on its first day of wto membership .

transport 2000 says the assembly executive made the pledge in its draft programme for government published last autumn .
and it claims the pledge has been " quietly removed " from the final version of the document , which says 25 buses will be replaced per year .
the lobby group is to ask the assembly 's regional development committee to support its call , at a meeting on wednesday morning .
there are 178 buses , mostly in the ulsterbus fleet , which are a staggering 18 years or older liz fawcett the group 's regional representative , liz fawcett , said it is furious that the promise had been dropped .
" it 's an enormous irony that the executive is providing free travel to pensioners and yet wo n't spend the money to improve the bus fleet it 's expecting them to use , " she said .
" in england , the government 's promised to get the average age of buses down to eight years .
" here , the average age of the ulsterbus large bus fleet is almost 13 years . "
she added : " there are 178 buses , mostly in the ulsterbus fleet , which are a staggering 18 years or older .
" it was those that the executive originally said it was going to replace .
if a mere 25 buses a year are replaced , the fleet is actually going to get older . "
' transport poverty ' in its presentation , the committee said it would highlight the problem of transport poverty in the rural areas served by ulsterbus , which runs northern ireland 's province-wide service .
" we estimate that almost 40 % of households in rural areas suffer from transport poverty , " dr fawcett said .
" they either do n't own a car or find running one a heavy financial burden .
" what concerns us is that more funding is going into roads than public transport in northern ireland which is of little use to this large proportion of the rural population .

transport 2000 says the assembly executive made the pledge in its draft programme for government published last autumn .
and it claims the pledge has been " quietly removed " from the final version of the document , which says 25 buses will be replaced per year .
the lobby group is to ask the assembly 's regional development committee to support its call , at a meeting on wednesday morning .
there are 178 buses , mostly in the ulsterbus fleet , which are a staggering 18 years or older liz fawcett the group 's regional representative , liz fawcett , said it is furious that the promise had been dropped .
" it 's an enormous irony that the executive is providing free travel to pensioners and yet wo n't spend the money to improve the bus fleet it 's expecting them to use , " she said .
" in england , the government 's promised to get the average age of buses down to eight years .
" here , the average age of the ulsterbus large bus fleet is almost 13 years . "
she added : " there are 178 buses , mostly in the ulsterbus fleet , which are a staggering 18 years or older .
" it was those that the executive originally said it was going to replace .
if a mere 25 buses a year are replaced , the fleet is actually going to get older . "
' transport poverty ' in its presentation , the committee said it would highlight the problem of transport poverty in the rural areas served by ulsterbus , which runs northern ireland 's province-wide service .
" we estimate that almost 40 % of households in rural areas suffer from transport poverty , " dr fawcett said .
" they either do n't own a car or find running one a heavy financial burden .
" what concerns us is that more funding is going into roads than public transport in northern ireland which is of little use to this large proportion of the rural population .
" the executive needs to start matching its fine words on public transport with action - by devoting a higher percentage of its transport and infrastructure budgets to bus and rail . "

thousands of people are trying to leave the country amid fears of us strikes , but neighbouring states are closing their borders .
the taleban have put up road blocks to stop people from moving unhcr spokesman yusuf hassan aid workers fear a humanitarian disaster as efforts to deliver food relief grind to a halt .
pakistani leaders have warned the taleban 's spiritual leader , mullah mohammad omar , that unless he surrenders osama bin laden - the prime suspect in the destruction a week ago of the world trade center in new york - he risks a devastating us strike .
clampdown according to eyewitnesses , the taleban appear to be trying to keep moveable property inside kabul , with checkpoints around the capital stopping citizens from leaving with their possessions .
a spokesman for the un high commission for refugees , yusuf hassan , said the taleban 's roadblocks at kabul and the north-eastern city of jalalabad were stopping the people themselves from leaving .
" it appears that significant movements of people are continuing out of kandahar , but from kabul and jalalabad i gather that the taleban have put up road blocks to stop people from moving , " he said .
at the same time , shopkeepers in the capital are taking action to prevent looting .
in another development , the main supplier of food aid to afghanistan , the world food programme -lrb- wfp -rrb- , said it had largely stopped moving wheat around the country and had ceased imports completely .
the wfp says it can not obtain the transport for the wheat , although aid agencies say this is not a problem in most regions of afghanistan .
" we have enough food stocks inside afghanistan to last normal operations for two to three weeks , " said wfp spokeswoman christiane berthiaume in geneva .
" we have stopped food shipments into the country due to the lack of commercial lorries in various parts of the country to move food . "
desperation the wfp had been feeding about three million displaced people in rural afghanistan before the crisis began and it pulled out its foreign aid staff .
now in the area around the western city of herat alone , about 370 afghan wfp workers are trying to ensure food distribution amongst 200,000 displaced people .
afghanistan 's neighbours already host several million afghan refugees , victims of civil war and drought , and have moved to close their borders since the present crisis erupted .
refugees massing at the pakistani border at chaman threw stones at frontier guards after being turned away , and some managed to force their way across .
riaz mohammed khan , a spokesman for pakistan 's foreign office , said there were fears that " hundreds of thousands " of afghans had left afghan cities and were heading for pakistan .
a bbc correspondent in the pakistani city of peshawar says most of the afghans who recently entered were women and children .
there are reports the taleban is refusing to allow any men to leave in case they are needed to fight .
the un has called on islamabad to re-open the border as fears mount for the refugees , with the harsh afghan winter approaching .

sir malcolm rifkind is a former foreign secretary and defence secretary while current conservative mp john maples spent time as both shadow foreign and shadow defence secretary in william hague 's team .
sir malcolm rifkind these are early days .
the government has obviously given quite proper priority to the issue and that is to be welcomed .
as yet , we are not privy to the thinking as to what measures they might take and nor would i expect them to share that thinking with us at the moment .
if america and her allies take action it should be action that actually has impact on the terrorist threat and is not merely symbolic sir malcolm rifkind i think the crucial requirement is that if america and her allies take action it should be action that actually has impact on the terrorist threat and is not merely symbolic .
if that means it takes longer then it is worth that extra time .
we have seen some punitive action taken in the past where one is sometimes left wondering about what the actual impact has been .
i think what i am saying is not likely to be controversial in washington .
there are two elements to any action : there are the terrorists themselves and those who give aid and comfort and sanctuary to the terrorists .
factors behind action i am not at liberty to sit here and say what the action should be .
it will depend on the intelligence information , on how reliable that information is seen to be , on whether they get over-flying rights from other nations .
the nature of the world in which we live is such that some of the nations that have pledged support will start to introduce qualifications and caveats and concerns .
so i think the process of putting a coalition together is quite complicated as the us does not yet know what action exactly it is going to take .
the us is now convinced it can not act unilaterally , although i suppose in washington they would resist the argument that they had ever done otherwise .
it is good that the language and the policies which are being discussed imply they do not want to act unilaterally .
the middle east peace process is strictly speaking a separate issue but one of the reasons we have seen terrorist attacks by islamic fundamentalists in the middle east is the very high emotional dimension the conflict there has produced .
peace progress helps it is in such circumstances that extreme behaviour becomes more likely and therefore if there is a prospect for any progress in the peace process it should be welcomed .
as for how the us attacks affect daily life in the uk , i would say that although everybody is using and understands the language that this is a war and has to be fought as a war , it is a very different kind of war to previous conflicts in the past .
i think the main implication domestically will be tighter security .
john maples i do think that tony blair is doing the right thing .
there should be no daylight between the uk and us , and i think he is on the right lines .
obviously the us is in the lead on this , but tony blair is involved in talking to president bush on this , and this should give him some influence on this .
one of the consequences of this attack is we are going to have to be prepared to surrender some of our personal freedoms john maples i just hope the government is taking all the precautions necessary to stop this happening here .
it 's been proven in the us that osama bin laden has sleeper cells all over the place , and it is highly likely that he has some in britain and in france - as both countries fought in the gulf war .
we do n't know for certain if bin laden was behind this attack but he was clearly involved in the previous attack on the world trade center and the attacks on the american embassies in africa .
i think he has a much wider network than is generally realised .
one of the consequences of this attack is we are going to have to be prepared to surrender some of our personal freedoms .
we may have to consider identity cards , increased surveillance and heightened security checks .
as far as dealing with the terrorists and those states that harbour them we can use a combination of economic and diplomatic pressure .
libya , iran and syria have all been quick to express their regret at the bombings but it remains to be seen if they will be tough on terrorists .
if we can bring those responsible to book with only the threat of military force that is by far the best outcome , but i think military action will have to be taken .
isolating some states states that wo n't comply and who continue to shelter terrorists will have to be isolated .
that isolation could involve the world bank and the imf refusing to deal with that country , as could international airlines .
such measures would have an affect on the ruling elite of those countries and would not affect the population as a whole .
there are a whole series of things that we can use to make life extremely difficult for these people .
american military power is one of them and i think it is likely that it will have to be used .
debt to america i think we owe our freedom to the us , particularly because of the stance they took in the cold war .
we must also remember how important the health of the us economy is to our own .
we must also remember we are both morally and practically involved in this situation .
we are a terrorist target and we have been attacked as more than 100 of our civilians have been killed .

as bbc news online 's emma clark explains , the economy barely functions , leaving afghans to fend for themselves .
centuries ago afghanistan was part of an ancient trade route that supplied the west with spices , rich silks and other goods .
although the importance of this trade route has since diminished , the country 's impoverished people still cling to trade as a means of survival . "
look at pictures of kabul .
there is basically nothing standing " aqib elah mehboob khadim ali shah bukhari battered by two decades of war and political in-fighting , afghanistan has had little else to depend on .
much of the country lies in ruins , and there are no industries to speak of .
there has also been little time or resources to rebuild infrastructure or factories .
" look at pictures of kabul .
there is basically nothing standing , " said aqib elahi mehboob , head of pakistan research at khadim ali shah bukhari & co , a brokerage in karachi .
" there is nothing to hit in terms of infrastructure , " he added , referring to potential us air strikes .
no economic data most economic data for afghanistan dried up in 1979 following the soviet invasion and became non-existent after 1993 .
" it 's a subsistence economy and it is not measurable by market yardsticks , " said ajit ranade , chief economist at abn amro india .
principal afghan exports -lrb- 1990 -rrb- fruit & nuts carpets wool karakul -lrb- sheep -rrb- skins cotton source : eiu but according to a united nations rehabilitation action plan in 1993 , the country 's economy was worth 124.7bn afghanis -lrb- $ 1.72bn -rrb- in 1991-1992 .
by comparison , the country had a 117bn afghanis economy in 1978-1979 , showing a miserable rate of expansion during the decade .
trade is mainly with neighbouring pakistan and includes the export of persian carpets , wool , sheep skins and dried fruit , as well as smuggled goods , including fridges and video players .
more recently , afghanis have shown their resourcefulness by selling shards of the giant buddha statues blown up by the taleban in the spring .
there is also illegal trading of arms and contraband opium .
however , since the terrorist attacks on the us and the closing of borders around landlocked afghanistan , trade has been severely hampered .
agriculture in peril afghanistan 's other mainstay is agriculture , but this has been badly hit by a drought in 2000 and the taleban 's decision to curb poppy production .
the economist intelligence unit said in a recent country report that the crop " has traditionally been used as a source of credit and many farmers are finding themselves unable to repay their seasonal loans " .
while some farmers have resorted to selling land , livestock and even their young daughters to repay debts , others have joined the ever-growing tide of afghan refugees .
fending for themselves the impression in the west is that most afghans are left to fend for themselves , as the ruling taleban government concentrates on building an islamic state .
" the taleban are not interested in economic management , " said gareth price , an analyst at the economist intelligence unit .
in june the taleban announced an $ 82m national budget , which was reported in the local pakistani newspaper , dawn .
more than half of the money was for the use of mullah omar , the leader of the taleban movement , and is expected to fund the war effort .
the eiu , which has studied the budget , added that " the development budget of $ 343,000 is clearly inadequate to have a significant impact on the devastated infrastructure of the country " .
starvation millions face starvation and the problem has become even more acute as aid agencies pull out and neighbouring countries , such as iran , close their borders with afghanistan .
" the major toll will not be through air strikes -lsb- by the us -rsb- , it will be through starvation and lack of medical supplies , " said mr elahi mehboob at khadim ali shah bukhari .
it is estimated that about 2.5 million afghans have died over the last 20 years as a result of the war , famine or lack of medical attention .
if afghanistan refuses to give up its infamous " guest " osama bin laden , that number looks set to accelerate as tens of thousands of afghan people flee their homes .
pakistan 's dilemma across the border , afghanistan 's closest ally pakistan also has much hanging in the balance as the us ponders military action .
president pervez musharraf risks strife at home - where many pakistanis support the taleban and islamic fundamentalism - if he is seen to assist the us too much .
such internal conflict could seriously damage pakistan 's $ 60bn economy , which experiences a growth rate of 2.6 % , well below averages in the region .
the takeover by the military , when general musharraf ousted the former prime minister nawaz sharif in 1999 , as well as mismanaged power projects have already sent private investors running , said abn amro 's mr ranade .
sanctions against the country 's nuclear activity have robbed it of much needed investment , while poor weather has battered its cotton production .
-lrb- agriculture accounts for 25 % of the country 's gross domestic product . -rrb-
good or bad ?
should pakistan refuse to assist the us in possible strikes against afghanistan , it risks derailing delicate negotiations to secure further funding from the international monetary fund .
country profile - pakistan population : 137m annual income per head : about $ 400 -lrb- less than 2 % of the uk average -rrb- total debts : $ 36bn source : fitch ibca " the economy has been bad this year , but it should pick up the year after , unless the afghanistan thing blows up , " said mr elahi mehboob .
" next week should show whether good or bad will win out . "
but whereas pakistan can hope for a better outcome , afghanistan 's near non-existent economy has little to lose and its future looks bleak whatever the us decides to do .
