uncollected child maintenance by the government agency now stands at more than £ 500m .

and 47,000 parents had been waiting for more than a year for their first assessment .
professor webb said children were being let down by the government , and urged it to scrap the csa .
he said : " the continued failure of the csa means that hundreds of thousands of children are not getting the financial support that is theirs by right .
" it is mind-boggling that uncollected maintenance payments can exceed half a billion pounds and that people are having to wait a year for an initial assessment . "
' radical reform ' professor webb continued : " performance targets that are not met get scrapped , and the suffering of families goes on .
" it is time for the government to admit that the csa has been a fiasco from the start and to scrap it . "
but the government has already rejected scrapping the agency , in favour of what it described as " radical reform " .
ministers believe a new simplified " flat rate " calculation for maintenance , to be introduced for new cases next year , will solve the problem .
a spokeswoman for the department of work and pensions said the new system would leave csa staff spending less time assessing payments and more time chasing them up .

the train manufacturers alstom advised the rail company that some of the trains ' electronics could fail , threatening passenger safety .
the company said commuters on nine different routes in ayrshire , inverclyde and strathclyde were experiencing " minimal " delays and there would be reduced carriage capacity , especially during peak times .
scotrail said it hoped all trains would be back in service early next week .

many parents questioned in a survey by the sptc said internal assessments were good in theory .

the sptc said the excess of coursework and tests means there is little time left for learning .
one of the suggestions is to make four subjects the normal maximum - a solution which would not necessarily suit all pupils .
this year 's exams results will be delivered next month , with ministers and educationalists hoping that the scottish qualifications authority can avoid a repeat of last year 's problems .

two police stations in surda and a checkpoint in beitunia run by force 17 , a palestinian elite police unit , were hit .
the friday morning bombardment came after the teenager was shot dead the day before in an apparent drive-by shooting near the entrance to the jewish settlement of givat zeev , just north of jerusalem .
israeli police said that the boy , ronen landau , was being driven home by his father when palestinians in a moving vehicle opened fire on the vehicle the two were in .
" shots were fired from a truck at children in a playing field ... where apparently no one was hurt .
then the truck drove on and -lrb- the assailants -rrb- shot at a car and killed one person , " a security source told reuters news agency .
medical workers failed to revive the boy , who was shot in the head .
an israeli minister was travelling on the road where the attack happened a short time before it took place .
about 30 jewish settlers have been killed in drive-by shootings since the present wave of unrest between israelis and palestinians began last september .
last week , a three-month old baby was among three palestinians shot dead in the west bank in an attack carried out by israeli vigilantes .
' imaginary ceasefire ' in the wake of the latest killing , israeli settler leaders called for an end to what they described as the imaginary ceasefire .
a spokesman for israel 's prime minister , ariel sharon , said the killing showed that the palestinians had decided to continue their campaign of terror .
a bbc correspondent in jerusalem says there is a fear that while diplomatic efforts are continuing to underpin an us-negotiated ceasefire , extremists on both sides are continuing to determine what happens on the ground .
overall , more than 600 people have been killed in the violence - about 500 of them palestinians .

it is in april and june that producers can command the highest prices for their product , with the quality deteriorating from then on .
but it has now emerged that some nepalese tea could pass for the coarser grades of the darjeeling variety .
and this has prompted fears that indian tea producers could see their profits - already hit by poor yields - further eroded .
" the teas being produced have no organised marketing system and it is believed that traders from india and foreign buyers are purchasing these teas at very low prices , " said mr k.s david , managing director of leading indian tea producer goodricke group .
" the produce is then finding its way to markets all over the world and being sold as darjeeling tea or is being blended in india and sold as darjeeling tea . "
the worst fears that consumers could be duped into drinking a fake darjeeling are unlikely to be realised in the uk .
" you could see other markets in eastern europe or on the continent , might utiltise those teas if they were not producing pure blends , " a uk tea buyer said .
" it is not something we would be looking to dilute with nepalese tea . "
darjeeling competition anything that hurts the local tea producers could create huge problems for the regional economy .
the problem has in part arisen because of the nepalese ambition to boost its tea production .
the nepalese government is now thought to be interested in privatising some of its tea plantations or leasing them out to private managers , according to an article in the kathmandu post .
whether nepal would be able to command the investment and expertise needed to become a large scale producer of tea is unclear .
unlike other commodities , tea is bought at weekly auctions in different countries or by private agreement .
as such , it has never attracted the speculative interest of other commodities that are traded on world futures markets .
but , even as the situation currently stands , it creates a problem for the darjeeling tea growers .
some darjeeling producers have switched to making green tea but this now faces competition from china , mr david wrote in a recent article .
" for the goodricke darjeeling gardens , it is also a struggle ...
efforts are on to find new markets , " wrote mr david .
figures vary as to how many the local industry employs , but some estimate that more than 52,000 people have work on a permanent basis .
the industry is thought to generate more money locally than tourism .
indian tea competition indian tea producers could also face more competition from companies keen to target its local market .
about three quarters of the 850 million kilos of tea india produces a year is destined for its home market .
this market is protected by india 's import duties , which are expected to eventually fall under pressure from the world trade organisation .
so , in practice , indian tea producers could in future face greater competition from from companies trying to access its home market than from nepalese tea exporters , the uk tea buyer said .
india was once the world 's leading tea producer , accounting for about 30 % of world production in 1997 .
but the country has been relegated in the world 's export markets as a result of growing domestic demand and increasing competition from other countries .
kenya and sri lanka are two countries who have successfully managed to boost their exports of tea .
nepal joins vietnam , in trying to boost their exports of tea .

mr archer was found guilty of manipulating the stock market by selling shares in a swedish company to deliberately drive down the firm 's share price in december 1998 .
he also placed a substantial buy order with a swedish broker so that he would trade artificially with himself and thus manipulate the price downwards sfa city regulator the securities and futures authority -lrb- sfa -rrb- - a subsidiary of the financial services authority - spent two years investigating mr archer and his co-workers at the investment bank credit suisse first boston -lrb- csfb -rrb- .
the three men banned from the city were known as the " flaming ferraris " after their favourite drink .
the watchdog found that mr archer , david crisanti and adrian ezra were not fit or proper persons to be members of the city 's register of authorised dealers , and mr crisanti was also removed from the register of managers .
the expulsion of james archer is the latest disgrace for his family .
last week his father was sent to jail for perjury and trying to pervert the course of justice .
market manipulation mr archer was found guilty of " trying to manipulate the closing price " of the swedish stock exchange -lrb- sse -rrb- and " trading directly on -lsb- its -rsb- computerised trading system without authorisation " .
" all three individuals were found guilty of deceiving the sse and csfb 's compliance department . "
all three individuals were found guilty of deceiving the sse and csfb 's compliance department sfa during the last few days of december 1998 , the stock portfolio controlled by mr archer would have benefited by a sharp fall in the share price of swedish wood pulp company stora .
according to the city watchdog , mr archer " tried to manipulate the price downwards by aggressive selling " .
" he also placed a substantial buy order with a swedish broker so that he would trade artificially with himself and thus manipulate the price downwards . "
to escape detection , " mr archer used a mobile phone to place the buy order " .
within minutes of james archer 's trading activities , stora 's share price plunged from 90 swedish kronor to 60 kronor .
confession when the swedish stock exchange investigated the deals , mr archer insisted he had traded with a real buyer .
after further inquiries by the sse and csfb in 1999 , mr archer admitted that he had tried to manipulate stora by trading with himself .
rehabilitation is , of course , not ruled out , but would need to be demonstrated before individuals could again be entrusted with registered positions sfa shortly afterwards csfb dismissed mr archer , along with mr ezra and mr crisanti , who also admitted their part in the deception .
all three men were required to pay a contribution to sfa 's costs .
mr archer and mr ezra have each paid £ 50,000 , while mr crisanti paid £ 100,000 .
the regulator noted that mr archer and his former colleagues could re-join the city 's register of authorised dealers .
" rehabilitation is , of course , not ruled out , but would need to be demonstrated before individuals could again be entrusted with registered positions where customers and others rely on their integrity and professionalism , " it said .
