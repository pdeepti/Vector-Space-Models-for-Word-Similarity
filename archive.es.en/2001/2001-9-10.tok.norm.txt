gun battles the infamous la modelo prison is one of colombia 's most dangerous jails .
in july it was the scene of a full-scale battle between guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries allied with drug traffickers .
ten inmates died and 22 others were injured as the two sides battled it out with grenades and automatic weapons .
the men deny training farc rebels " the three irishmen were transferred as a precaution .

the 300-page volume has been sold to an american publisher , feral house , and will be in us bookshops by the end of the year .
we have taken out an injunction to temporarily restrain publication and distribution of a book by mr ian brady ashworth hospital under a deal with a british distributor , copies of the book , called " the gates of janus " , were due to go on sale in the uk at around the same time .
but ashworth hospital , where brady is a patient , has taken out an injunction , which for the time being prevents the book from being published or distributed in britain .
the top-security hospital says it is a " temporary " measure so the contents of the book can be checked .
" we need to have sight of the book to make sure it does not breach patient confidentiality , " said a hospital spokeswoman .
profiles of killers as a result , a shipment of 3,500 copies of the book to britain has been halted , pending a hearing next week in front of a high court judge .
speaking from los angeles , the book 's american publisher , adam parfrey , told bbc news online the hospital 's concerns were not justified .
" this legal challenge has no merit whatsoever .
the book does not discuss ashworth or its patients , " he said .
mr parfrey said the book was partly a philosophical analysis of the human condition and crime in general , and partly an attempt by brady to profile specific criminals , in the manner of the fbi .
brady 's former lawyer , benedict birnberg , is following the legal moves .
now retired , he remains the executor of the killer 's estate .
he told bbc news online that he hoped the injunction would be lifted quickly .
" ashworth wants to be satisfied that there is nothing in the book that is prejudicial to its role as a hospital , providing a therapeutic environment for its patients .
" as far as i can see there is nothing in it that should cause concern .
in fact the book may be of benefit to society as the object is to help identify the kind of people who become serial killers . "
royalties the victims of crime trust has objected to the publication of the book , and is calling on bookshops in the uk not to stock the title .
there has been speculation about the money that brady might earn from sales of the book .
mr birnberg said that an advance of about $ 5,000 -lrb- £ 3,420 -rrb- plus any subsequent royalties , would be used to help support brady 's mother , who is now in her nineties .
" ian brady will receive no money himself , " he said .
but he confirmed that until the issue is resolved , copies of the book can not be imported .
" the effect of the injunction is to ban publication and distribution of the book in this country until the order is lifted , " he said .
" if any copies of the book came into the country at the moment they could be impounded . "
human rights but mr birnberg said that if the injunction was not lifted , brady could bring a complaint under the human rights act , saying he was being denied freedom of expression .
" this is not the first time such action has been taken against a book , but it is very unusual , " he said .
the book may be of benefit to society as the object is to identify the kind of people who become serial killers benedict birnberg brady 's former lawyer ian brady has told bbc news online that when he originally wrote the book , he carefully disguised his identity .
" but as i no longer have to care about public opinion , i have authorised the book to be published under my name , " he said .
it discusses the yorkshire ripper , peter sutcliffe , and the poisoner graham young , but contains no revelations about the murders brady committed with myra hindley .
" the book comes from ian brady and it is informed by his life , pitiful and horrible as it was , " said publisher adam parfrey .
" one can say he intimates things about himself , and he does have an insight into these crimes .
but there is nothing in any detail about his own crimes . "
life story whatever the fate of this book , it will not be ian brady 's last word .
he has already written his autobiography , which is likely to cause an even greater stir .
" it was proof-read by an international publisher years ago and immediately accepted , including my condition that nothing is edited or altered , " he said .
" my other condition was that it was not to be published until after my death , or instructions to the contrary .
it is languishing in a vault . "
brady was jailed for life in 1966 , with his accomplice myra hindley , after being found guilty of the murders of lesley ann downey and edward evans .
he was also convicted of the murder of 12-year-old john kilbride .
he and hindley later confessed to killing two other children , pauline reade and keith bennett , and burying their bodies on saddleworth moor , near manchester .

" we have decided to accept aig 's demand , " a hyundai securities official said on monday .
american international group -lrb- aig -rrb- signed a memorandum of understanding with south korean financial authorities on 23 august to buy hyundai securities and two of its subsidiaries .
the sale of hyundia , along with daewoo motor and chipmaker hynix are key parts of south korea 's economic restructuring plans .
how much ?
the largest foreign investment in south korea 's financial sector , hit obstacles after aig insisted the share price should be lowered .
hyundia 's board meeting must still pass the decision to lower the price of preferred shares from 8,940 won -lrb- $ 7.00 -rrb- to 7,000 won -lrb- $ 5.44 -rrb- per unit .
the sale of the three firms is key to the rescue of the hyundai group , once the south korea 's largest conglomerate , from a prolonged cash crisis .
government officials hoped to finalise the deal with aig , the world 's largest insurer by market capitalization , by 31 october .
us bailouts the us insurer , which agreed last month to pay 1.1 trillion won -lrb- $ 854.7m -rrb- for control of hyundai securities and two ailing financial units , had threatened to cancel the deal unless its price demand was met .
the official did not say why hyundai decided to give in to aig 's demand .
south korea is also in talks with us automaker general motors to sell the bankrupt daewoo motor .
media reports said gm was ready to pay nearly $ 782m to buy two daewoo plants but not its largest and oldest plant .
also on monday , ratings agency standard and poor 's lowered hynix semiconductor 's credit rating by three notches as creditors continued to haggle over how to rescue the ailing microchip giant .
