she says her first priority is to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease , followed by a heavy emphasis on regeneration of the countryside in the wake of the outbreak .
foot-and-mouth facts total number of confirmed foot-and-mouth cases in the uk 1,752 - four on 16 june 3,331,000 animals slaughtered 8,203 premises with animals slaughtered or earmarked for slaughter in her first interview since becoming secretary of state at defra , mrs beckett told bbc radio 4 's farming today programme she had devised a scheme to regenerate the rural economy .
farmers have expressed fears that by dropping agriculture from the new department 's name , the government will move funding away from food production towards rural regeneration and environmental programmes .
ideas that have already been discussed include paying farmers for maintaining wildlife habitats on their land , rather than concentrating solely on intensive production .
reform mrs beckett accepted this shift would form the background to discussions on reform of the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- and made it clear she felt britain would be " leading the pack " in pursuing such reform along greener lines .
mrs beckett faces a tough challenge in trying to bring a swift end to the foot-and-mouth crisis in which more than three million livestock animals throughout britain have been destroyed .
she takes on her new role at a time when farming is in crisis , despite government pre-election claims the end of the foot-and-mouth epidemic was in sight .
the royal college of veterinary surgeons has called for a full independent inquiry on the outbreak once the disease has been eradicated .
earlier this week the new rural affairs secretary said she could not comment on whether there would be a public inquiry into the continuing foot-and-mouth crisis , but it remained " under discussion . "

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- the disease that refuses to die low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo saturday , 16 june , 2001 , 05:07 gmt 06:07 uk the disease that refuses to die the disease keeps breaking out in new areas by bbc news online 's environment correspondent alex kirby not long ago , government ministers were predicting the uk 's foot-and-mouth outbreak would by now be at an end .
attempts to eradicate it were " in the home straight " , they insisted , as the general election neared .
the election past , there is now little need to claim that the disease is finished .
instead of vanishing , it keeps on appearing with new virulence in areas hitherto unaffected .
in one sense , that is no great surprise .
there is still confusion about the exact numbers of sheep which passed through longtown market in cumbria last february , when foot-and-mouth disease was beginning to spread .
inquiry demands so animals from longtown may still be spreading the virus without anyone knowing they are liable to be carriers .
margaret beckett takes defra 's helm but such pools of infection may not completely explain the outbreak 's grip on life .
unless the government bows to pressure and holds a public inquiry into its own performance , suspicions will persist that it could have done better and ended the disaster sooner .
tim yeo , the conservative agriculture spokesman , believes an inquiry is essential because of the mistakes he thinks ministers made .
he told bbc news online : " they refused to admit that foot-and-mouth was a serious national crisis , and by doing so they made that crisis worse .
" it was a process of denial .
they should explain why they had this very narrow focus on the disease as an economic threat to agriculture .
" that prevented them seeing the wider costs it was exacting from tourism and the rural economy .
too slow " they want to avoid too detailed an analysis of what happened in the early stages , especially the time it took them to achieve the slaughter of infected animals within 24 hours of diagnosis , and the time it took to dispose of the carcasses .
" why did n't they bring the army in to help much earlier on ?
they were very slow off the mark to begin with .
" if they 'd acted as they should have done in those first few weeks , i think you might have seen only about a quarter of the cases that did in fact develop .
" they 're worried now about whether they really are on top of the situation . "
mr yeo is concerned that none of the ministers involved in what he calls " the catastrophic handling " of the crisis remains in office .
some sheep are still untraced he says he has evidence the government has been trying to force farmers to sign the official secrets act " to prevent them speaking out " about the way the outbreak has been handled .
the new minister in charge is margaret beckett , who heads the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- .
she said : " the veterinary advice has always been that there would be a long tail to the disease , that there may be fluctuations in daily numbers of cases and that its complete eradication would take some time .
limited opportunity " numbers of daily cases are dramatically down , but we take very seriously the disease situation which remains in certain areas . "
she has refused so far to say whether or not there will be a public inquiry .
a defra spokeswoman told bbc news online no farmers were being required to sign the official secrets act .
mrs beckett and her team have an opportunity to win back confidence , despite the mistakes of their predecessors .
but they will have to move fast to do so .
