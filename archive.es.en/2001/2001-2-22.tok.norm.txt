mr sharon made no mention of how cabinet posts would be allocated , but it has been reported by israel radio that the defence portfolio - which mr barak turned down - has been offered to the former labour party prime minister shimon peres .
for the second time this month , mr barak announced on tuesday that he would take a complete break from politics .
he has also resigned as leader of the labour party .
barak 's zigzags 6 feb : says he is quitting politics after election humiliation 9 feb : holds talks with sharon on unity government 15 feb : agrees to become defence minister in unity government 20 feb : pulls out of unity government talks and says he is taking a break from politics despite mr sharon 's expressed optimism about his ability to form a unity government , a bbc correspondent in jerusalem says some senior labour figures are working to bring him down .
palestinian officials , meanwhile , say the turmoil within israeli politics is harming the peace process .
mr zigzag in a letter to mr sharon , mr barak accused him of seriously harming trust between them , apparently angered by mr sharon 's willingness to include far-right parties in his national unity government .
" i decided not to join a national unity government as defence minister or in any other post and it is my intention to leave political and diplomatic activity for a period of time - as i originally promised , " mr barak wrote .
shortly after the results of the 6 february prime ministerial election became clear , mr barak made his first announcement that he would quit politics .
the political chaos in israel is harmful to the peace process nabil abu rudeina aide to yasser arafat nicknamed mr zigzag , for the number of times he has changed his mind on key policy issues , mr barak began talks with mr sharon over the defence post shortly afterwards .

labour is in a heated leadership struggle and it is not clear who will now represent it in talks with likud .
likud pressure some want nothing to do with mr sharon and his likud party , while others feel mr barak should have stuck by his original intention to bow out of politics , blaming him for such a disastrous defeat .
mr sharon wants a broad-based government as his only alternative is a narrow , more hardline government , which could well collapse within months .
" we do n't interfere in internal affairs of the labour party and mr barak was sharon 's preferred candidate for the defence portfolio , but we hope that his resignation will help the creation of a national unity government , " mr sharon 's spokesman , raanan gissin , said .
an aide to palestinian leader yasser arafat , nabil abu rudeina , warned on wednesday that " the political chaos in israel is harmful to the peace process " .
" we are waiting to see what kind of government will be formed in israel before making any judgment , " mr rudeina told the afp news agency .
mr barak was prime minister for less than two years , during which time he failed to reach a peace deal with the palestinians .
israelis became increasingly disenchanted with him during his last months in power when growing numbers of israelis were killed in the wave of violence that has become known as the al-aqsa intifada .
some 410 people have been killed , most of them palestinians , and about 60 israelis .

jade was just 14 years old when she became pregnant .
already a seasoned truant with little prospect of qualifications and a decent job , the idea of having a child filled her with despair .
" i cried for ages , " she said .
" you do n't know what to expect do you ?
it ruins your life , you just have to put your life on hold and look after your baby .
it just stops there and then . "

a foreign ministry statement accused the new us adminstration of taking a hard-line stance in its relations with the north .
pyongyang agreed to suspend testing long-range missiles in 1999 after the united states eased economic sanctions .
last month , north korea criticised remarks made by the new us secretary of state , colin powell , in which he referred to the country 's leader , kim jong-il , as a dictator .
missile programme mr powell said that george bush 's administration would review korea policy but was open to engagement with pyongyang within strict guidelines .
on thursday , a north korean foreign ministry spokesman was quoted by the official korean central news agency as saying that the country would not remain a " passive onlooker to the things that only hamper scientific and technological development " .
pyongyang agreed with the us in 1999 not to launch long-range missiles as long as it was in talks with washington .
it proposed that it would abandon its missile programme in exchange for help with the launching of commercial satellites .
rocket capability the scheme also included promises of us help for north korea 's devastated economy .
the us has frequently raised concern at the sale of north korean missile technology to several countries , including pakistan and iran .
it is also concerned pyongyang could build a rocket capable of delivering a bomb over a us city by 2005 .
north korea rattled the world when it test fired a missile over japan in 1998 .
pyongyang insisted the launch was aimed at putting a satellite into orbit .
but it was also seen as a demonstration of the north 's ability to fire long-range warheads .
