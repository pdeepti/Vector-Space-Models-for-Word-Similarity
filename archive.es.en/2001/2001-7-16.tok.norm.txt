last year more prisoners left prison by escaping from it than by being released .
last year nearly 3,500 inmates escaped from prisons in the state of sao paulo , more than were released after completing their sentences .
so far this year 1,300 have escaped and last week 106 got out of carandiru , the main prison in sao paulo , in the biggest ever mass escape through a tunnel .
after crawling through the tunnel under the prison walls , they then walked over two miles through sewers to freedom .
bribery an investigation by police and public prosecutors has shown that most escapes are planned and organised by gangs outside prison and cost between $ 4,000 and $ 8,000 per prisoner .
part of this money goes in bribes for prison staff .
tunnels are one of the most popular methods - this year alone 31 tunnels have been discovered in the carandiru prison .
some escapes have been spectacular , involving armed attacks on jails or ambushing prisoner transports on highways .
some have been simple - walking out dressed as a woman visitor or in the uniform of a guard .
mobile phones confiscated mobile phones smuggled into prisons now play an important part in many of the escapes .
over 800 of them have been confiscated from prisoners in the last two years .
according to sao paulo 's director of prisons , those who are escaping are the most dangerous prisoners , the ones who can afford to pay .
in an effort to make escaping more difficult , the prisoners in this category are now being transferred from the capital to a maximum security prison hundreds of kilometres away .

the research , commissioned by the countryside alliance 's campaign for shooting , has concluded that existing laws are targeting legitimate users of firearms rather than criminals .
the ban on ownership of handguns was introduced in 1997 as a result of the dunblane massacre , when thomas hamilton opened fire at a primary school leaving 16 children and their teacher dead .
existing gun laws do not lead to crime reduction and a safer place david bredin campaign for shooting but the report suggests that despite the restrictions on ownership the use of handguns in crime is rising .
the centre for defence studies at kings college in london , which carried out the research , said the number of crimes in which a handgun was reported increased from 2,648 in 1997/98 to 3,685 in 1999/2000 .
it also said there was no link between high levels of gun crime and areas where there were still high levels of lawful gun possession .
of the 20 police areas with the lowest number of legally held firearms , 10 had an above average level of gun crime .
and of the 20 police areas with the highest levels of legally held guns only two had armed crime levels above the average .
smuggling the campaign 's director , david bredin , said : " it is crystal clear from the research that the existing gun laws do not lead to crime reduction and a safer place .
" policy makers have targeted the legitimate sporting and farming communities with ever-tighter laws but the research clearly demonstrates that it is illegal guns which are the real threat to public safety . "
he said the rise was largely down to successful smuggling of illegal guns into the country .
weapons have even been disguised as key rings no larger than a matchbox to get them in , he said .
other sources of guns include battlefield trophies brought back by soldiers , the illegal conversion of replica firearms including blank firing pistols and the reactivation of weapons which had been deactivated .
ammunition examples of illegally manufactured guns include screwdrivers being adapted to fire off one round , he said .
the metropolitan police said its official figures showed a 20 % drop in armed robberies of commercial premises between april and july this year , compared with the same period last year .
a scotland yard spokesman said that , since april 2001 , the flying squad has arrested 39 people in connection with 34 armed incidents and seized 52 weapons .
operation trident , which investigates " black on black " shootings in the uk , has made more than 300 arrests , recovered 100 firearms and 1,500 rounds of ammunition since it was established a year ago .
the home office said measures were being taken to tackle handgun crime , including an intensified effort against illegally smuggled weapons .

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- calm plea over bnp campaign low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo monday , 16 july , 2001 , 06:24 gmt 07:24 uk calm plea over bnp campaign hundreds of asylum seekers are housed in sighthill a glasgow councillor is urging ethnic communities not to respond to a campaign by the british national party in areas where asylum seekers are housed .
bashir maan said the right wing group was " wasting its time " by issuing leaflets in the city 's sighthill area ahead of a visit by party chairman nick griffin .
there have been fears that a campaign by the bnp would stir up racial hatred against asylum seekers .
mr griffin arrived on sunday as part of a tour of edinburgh , glasgow and stirling and insisted that his party wanted to focus on asylum policy , which had led to the " dumping " of people in deprived areas .
aamer anwar : bnp " not welcome " there have been 90 racially-motivated attacks in the city this year and , with hundreds of asylum seekers housed at sighthill , there has been concern that the bnp could incite more racist attacks .
mr maan , president of the national association of british pakistanis , said people living in scotland should not be provoked by the move .
he said : " i would urge people of all races not to be provoked by this attempt to stir up trouble .
" the bnp will be looking for a vehement reaction in the city , so we should leave it up to the police to keep an eye on these people rather than take the law into our own hands .
police response " a tiny number of individuals might be seduced by crude propaganda but the bnp are wasting its time if it believes it can undo the good work to bring together the different communities . "
a spokeswoman for strathclyde police said : " we have learned about the visit and the event will be given an appropriate police response . "
nick griffin is touring scottish cities anti-racism campaigner aamer anwar said : " these people are not welcome here .
" freedom of speech in this case could come at the cost of more racial attacks . "
mr griffin , however , played down reports that the bnp was intent on whipping up racial hatred .
he said : " there is a campaign in the sighthill area launched by the local bnp .
channelling ' resentment ' " it is a matter of encouraging people who feel strongly about this issue that there is a political party that supports them .
" we are campaigning against the dumping of people in these areas and we want to turn incoherent resentment against asylum seekers into opposition to the politicians who made the policy . "
residents say asylum seekers get preferential treatment there are about 4,500 asylum seekers in scotland and most of them are in glasgow .
sighthill residents have already expressed anger at what they see is preferential treatment for the asylum seekers .
they attacked glasgow city council , which will get £ 100m from the home office over five years to house and support the asylum seekers .
a number of refugee groups have also criticised the lack of resources and support available and say there was not enough preparation before the houses were let to refugees .

according to the latest business in britain survey from lloyds tsb commercial , firms are seeing a drop in profits and are encountering cash flow problems .
the survey follows a report in may which found the rate of company failures in scotland was at its highest for nearly nine years .
a worldwide slowdown in areas like telecoms and electronics and the collapse of the dot coms " boom " have contributed to the gloom .
cash flow is also proving a problem the lloyds survey found that 34 % of scottish companies had experienced a fall in sales , compared with a figure of 26 % six months ago .
a quarter of firms also said they had been forced to lower prices during the period , an increase of 4 % on the december 2000 survey .
just 18 % of firms questioned said they would be able to raise prices during the second half of 2001 , while 46 % of respondent businesses experienced a decline in profits .
nearly a third of scottish companies also experienced cash flow problems , a figure higher than any other part of the uk .
manus fullerton of lloyds tsb scotland said : " scottish businesses have faced some difficult challenges during the first half of 2001 and are right to remain cautious about the future .
" confidence is at a low ebb , but there are practical steps which businesses can take to help improve their position in an intensively competitive marketplace .
liquidations increase " remaining conscious of the cash flow issue , for example , is crucial .
" prompt collection of monies owed can make the difference between being able to invest and expand with confidence or the upset of being in a continual vicious circle , battling to stay afloat . "
a report by business advisers grant thornton in may found that there had been a 36 % increase in the number of court liquidations between the last quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001 .
it also concluded that there had been a 4.9 % increase in the number of creditors ' voluntary liquidations over the same period .
the figures , according to grant thornton partner matt henderson , pointed towards tough times for the scottish economy .

public health minister yvette cooper urged the industry to agree to cut down on potentially harmful chemicals added to cigarettes .
she warned that if the industry did not respond then it risked having products withdrawn from sale .
the tobacco industry is already taking part in a 10-year voluntary agreement , begun in 1997 , to tell the government what additives are used in cigarettes .
ms cooper said : " 120,000 people die from smoking every year .
" the government is already providing support for smokers who want to give up but we also want to see the industry do more to cut potentially harmful additives and carcinogens from cigarettes too .
" people have the right to smoke but most people are unaware of the huge number of additives and carcinogens in cigarettes as well as nicotine .
" people are entitled to that information and to know that action is being taken to reduce the most dangerous constituents of cigarettes . " 40 chemicals a department of health spokeswoman said that out of the 400 constituents of tobacco smoke 40 were cancer-causing chemicals .
she added : " at the moment there is technology for the industry to reduce significantly or remove carcinogens .
" what yvette cooper is saying is she want 's the tobacco industry to completely remove or reduce alot of these carcinogens . "
the cigarette is like a dirty syringe for taking the drug nicotine sir paul nurse the spokeswoman said the minister could enforce her decision under the consumer protection act which provides a wide range of powers to regulate consumer products to make them safer .
a spokeswoman for action on smoking and health -lrb- ash -rrb- said an eu directive , due to come into effect in september 2002 , would increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packets and reduce the level of tar in cigarettes .

sir paul nurse , director general of imperial cancer research fund , said : " the cigarette is like a dirty syringe for taking the drug nicotine , with over 600 additives permitted .
" the tobacco companies have known how to make smoking safer for at least 25 years , but have consistently failed to do so .
" the current products cause premature death for half of all long-term smokers , so even a small improvement could save thousands of lives . "
sir paul called for legislation to force tobaco companies ' hands .
he said : " the current system to regulate additives under voluntary agreements has been in force since 1997 , but it clearly doesn ¿ t work .
" it ¿ s vital that the government forces tobacco companies by law to reduce the known toxins in cigarettes and to develop less hazardous products . "

as the tanks rolled into the palestinian-controlled area of the city , they destroyed five police posts .
it appears they were killed during a ' work accident ' while preparing a bomb israeli police spokesman meanwhile , the bodies of two palestinians who were apparently trying to plant a bomb have been found near the stadium where israel 's maccabiah games - or jewish olympics - are due to begin on monday evening .
the military said the soldiers who moved into hebron returned palestinian fire from several locations in the town , the only one in the west bank which is divided into israeli and palestinian zones .
the incidents followed attempts on sunday by israeli foreign minister shimon peres and palestinian leader yasser arafat to end the violence in talks in cairo .
palestinians injured the posts that the israeli troops destroyed were run by force 17 , a palestinian unit which israel has accused of repeated shooting and bomb attacks .
palestinian officials said nine people were wounded .
on thursday , israeli tanks moved briefly into the palestinian part of hebron after two jewish settlers were shot and killed .
witnesses said monday 's operation was much larger .
it followed repeated exchanges of fire between palestinian neighbourhoods and israeli army positions .
escalating violence incursions by israeli forces into palestinian-controlled areas in the west bank and gaza strip were frequent before a us-sponsored ceasefire came into effect last month .
however , the truce has never fully taken hold , and the violence has been escalating steadily again .
the two palestinians who died were killed in an explosion about one kilometre -lrb- 0.5 miles -rrb- from jewish west jerusalem 's teddy stadium , where the 16th maccabiah games are to open in a night-time ceremony attended by prime minister ariel sharon .
athletes frightened " the bodies of two palestinians were found in a field , and it appears they were killed during a ' work accident ' while preparing a bomb , " police said .
israel has mounted a heavy security operation for the games , which were almost cancelled after numerous jewish foreign delegations said the palestinian uprising , now in its tenth month , had frightened away many athletes .
the maccabiah games are held in israel every four years .
israeli government officials had said their cancellation would be a victory for " terrorism " .
' still hope for peace ' mr peres and mr arafat met in cairo on sunday in the latest attempt to end the deadlock over the ceasefire .
mr peres was quoted as saying after the 90-minute meeting that there was still hope of finding a solution based on the recommendations of an international panel led by former us senator george mitchell .
but he said that israel would not " negotiate under fire " , and that first hostilities and what he described as incitement had to cease .
mr peres also denied media reports that israel was planning a large-scale military offensive in the palestinian areas .
but his perceived conciliatory stance was met with criticism from a right-wing cabinet colleague .
" what new things did peres sell this time ?
we do n't know .
we have suffered enough from peres 's attitude , " tourism minister rehavam ze 'evi was quoted as saying .
