of course , it was just a few days ago that they said they did n't know where he was , so i have no reason to believe anything a taliban representative has said donald rumsfeld the taleban ambassador to pakistan , mullah abdul salam zaeef , announced on sunday that " osama is in afghanistan , but he is at an unknown place for his safety and security " .
the saudi-born militant is the united states ' main suspect for the 11 september suicide hijacking attacks , and washington has demanded that the taleban hand him over or face punishment for sheltering him .
mr rumsfeld said that there was no reason to believe anything the taleban had to say , adding that it was " self-evident " that they would pay the price if they did not hand over bin laden .
mr zaeef said washington could break the stalemate if it were willing to provide proof of bin laden 's role .
" we say if they change and talk to us , and if they present evidence , we will respect their negotiations and that might change things . "
however , the president of pakistan , which has been negotiating with the taleban , said that , although hopes were dim the taleban would meet the us demands and hand him over , the " doors were open " for further negotiation .
" we are interacting with the taleban to moderate their views in accordance with the dictates of the world opinion and we are still carrying on doing that , " president pervez musharraf said in an interview on us television .
' nonsense ' saudi defence minister prince sultan bin abdul aziz has dismissed as " nonsense " reports that the saudi authorities would allow washington to use its bases to attack afghanistan .
however , he did say saudi airspace could still be used as his country 's contribution .
" we do not accept the presence in our country of a single soldier at war with muslims or arabs , " prince sultan said in comments published on saudi arabia 's official okaz newspaper on sunday .
the bbc middle east correspondent says this is the clearest indication yet of where saudi arabia stands over the western military build up in the gulf .
the comments imply that american planes could fly over saudi arabia but not launch an attack from its territory .
there has been much confusion over how far saudi arabia would work with the us since the 11 september attacks .
saudi officials have hitherto been reluctant to comment publicly , apparently fearful of a backlash if afghan civilians are killed in any military action .
osama bin laden 's main aims include the removal of us forces from saudi arabia , which he says defiles islam , and overthrowing the saudi monarchy .

speaking in the sunday telegraph , bleasdale claimed a political satire he was writing based on life under new labour would be axed if he did not make heavy cuts to it .
his remarks led to a conservative mp challenging the bbc 's ethics in interfering with the script for running scared .
we agreed not to do any more work on running scared six months ago bbc spokesman but the bbc said the project had stalled six months ago when it was mutually decided not to progress with it .
bleasdale 's previous work has included the award-winning boys from the blackstuff and the monocled mutineer for the bbc and gbh for channel 4 .
the newspaper claimed acclaimed actors such as robert lindsey , julie walters and jane horrocks had been on board for the project and that the dispute had put a halt to pre-production work .
but the bbc said running scared had never actually been officially commissioned and that other writers were currently working on a biting new labour satire .
bleasdale penned the 1986 drama the monocled mutineer a spokesman said : " this is a project we have been on for a number of years but as sometimes happens the scripts did not come together .
" we agreed not to do any more work on running scared six months ago . "
' too close ' bleasdale 's side of the story was that he was being asked to cut six hours worth of script down to just one hour for bbc one .
he said : " i have told them i ca n't make any more cuts and i ca n't obey their rules . "
the news led to accusations from conservative mp michael fabricant that the bbc was too close to new labour .
" questions naturally arise about whether this decision was taken on programming grounds , " he told the sunday telegraph .
but the bbc spokesman added : " the theme of the project was not a biting new labour satire as that is being worked on by peter kosminsky and leigh jackson , the award-wining writers of warriors . "
he also rejected the idea the corporation would interfere with a fictional drama on political grounds , adding that the " voice of the writer is always championed at the bbc " .

national air traffic services -lrb- nats -rrb- , of which the government has sold a 46 % stake to the airline group consortium , will cut 225 of its 1,128 support and management staff , a spokesman told bbc news online .
" the affect of the 11 september is to bring forward the reductions .
there will be a 20 % cut in support and management stuff , on a volunary basis but we 've set no time scale , " a nats spokesman said .
but there are no plans to make cuts to 2,000 existing air traffic controllers or reduce the recruitment intake .
" we have recently stepped up recruitment on air traffic controllers from 120 to 180 to meet forecast demand , " he said .
attack impact the airline group spokesman said it is " too early to say " what the impact 11 september would have on revenues and that " we inherited nats ' own plans to cut staff " .
although air traffic has returned to normal levels after falling 6.5 % in the week after 11 september , nats is anticipating a significant income drop this autumn as airlines cut flight schedules and fleet sizes .
about 40 % of nats ' income comes from transatlantic flights , where most of the airlines ' cuts are being made .
new schedules for the airlines come into effect in late october .
the airline group , whose members include british airways , virgin atlantic and easyjet , bought its stake in nats two months ago from the government for £ 800m -lrb- $ 1.18bn -rrb- .
' unworkable ' the cuts come after the independent on sunday reported a member of the airline group saying that the nats business plan was now unworkable .
" the bottom line is that nats ' revenue has got to be affected , " easyjet chief executive ray webster , chief executive of easyjet told the independent on sunday .
" we have to reassess our business priorities and review our expenditure plans . "
the airline group has until december to submit a business plan to secure the funding promised by the government earlier this year .
" we have a financing deal completely pinned down with the banks , " the airline group spokesman said .

national air traffic services -lrb- nats -rrb- , of which the government has sold a 46 % stake to the airline group consortium , will cut 225 of its 1,128 support and management staff , a spokesman told bbc news online .
" the affect of the 11 september is to bring forward the reductions .
there will be a 20 % cut in support and management stuff , on a volunary basis but we 've set no time scale , " a nats spokesman said .
but there are no plans to make cuts to 2,000 existing air traffic controllers or reduce the recruitment intake .
" we have recently stepped up recruitment on air traffic controllers from 120 to 180 to meet forecast demand , " he said .
attack impact the airline group spokesman said it is " too early to say " what the impact 11 september would have on revenues and that " we inherited nats ' own plans to cut staff " .
although air traffic has returned to normal levels after falling 6.5 % in the week after 11 september , nats is anticipating a significant income drop this autumn as airlines cut flight schedules and fleet sizes .
about 40 % of nats ' income comes from transatlantic flights , where most of the airlines ' cuts are being made .
new schedules for the airlines come into effect in late october .
the airline group , whose members include british airways , virgin atlantic and easyjet , bought its stake in nats two months ago from the government for £ 800m -lrb- $ 1.18bn -rrb- .
' unworkable ' the cuts come after the independent on sunday reported a member of the airline group saying that the nats business plan was now unworkable .
" the bottom line is that nats ' revenue has got to be affected , " easyjet chief executive ray webster , chief executive of easyjet told the independent on sunday .
" we have to reassess our business priorities and review our expenditure plans . "
the airline group has until december to submit a business plan to secure the funding promised by the government earlier this year .
" we have a financing deal completely pinned down with the banks , " the airline group spokesman said .

the findings , published in the british journal of psychiatry , show that cities in the uk and ireland have the highest depression rates and cities in spain the lowest .
the report - the first from a major european study of depression - also found women are more likely to be depressed than men , particularly those living in towns and cities .
according to the report 's authors , including dr christopher dowrick and dr greg wilkinson of the university of liverpool , depression has an impact on the community greater than that of many chronic physical diseases .
' highly prevalent ' " this confirms that depressive disorder is a highly prevalent condition among working age adults in europe , particularly in urban centres , " the report says .
it concludes that the study should be used to implement fair and effective policies across the continent to address this " public health challenge " .
researchers used randomly selected samples of adults living in urban and rural areas in the uk , ireland , norway , finland and spain .
religion they were chosen as good representations of northern and southern europe , representing different religious denominations .
the british rural research site was in the welsh vale of clwyd and in ireland it was the county of laois .
liverpool and dublin were used as the urban areas sampled .
the highest prevalence was the uk and urban ireland with 17.1 % and 12.8 % respectively .
lowest was urban spain , where the rate of depression was just 2.6 % .
gender samples found an overall prevalence of depressive disorders across europe of 10.05 % for women and 6.61 % for men .

farmers union of wales president bob parry said " inadequate " port controls on illegally importing food meant biological weapons could be hidden in food and smuggled into the country .
mr parry feared biological weapons could be carried in livestock he said the passage of foot-and-mouth disease into the uk from a single source put the spotlight on the transportation of weapons in the wake of the attacks on the us .
mr parry was speaking as farmers across wales protested over uk controls of illegal food imports in a bid to stamp out any future forms of foot-and-mouth .
many believe illegal imports from countries where the disease is endemic are the source of the outbreak which has been raging for over nine months .
' import dangers ' protesters handed out leaflets in cardiff and wrexham aimed at highlighting the dangers of bringing imported food into the country .
a recent survey by the national farmers union showed more than half of those questioned had no ideas of what regulations exist .
mr parry said customs operations were already being exploited by smugglers illegally bringing meat into the country and action was needed to clamp down following the terrorist attacks .
" it is not outside the bounds of reality that some of these terrorist organisations have the money and the facilities to develop biological weapons , " he said .
" i am calling once again on the government to invest heavily in staff and security equipment at our ports and airports to immediately halt this disgusting and potentially deadly trade .
very little has been mentioned about the vulnerability of our food system in general to terror attack dr simon whitby , biological weapons expert " the government must take heed of these warnings and halt all illegal imports now . "
mr parry said the scientific community backed up his call .
dr simon whitby of bradford university , an expert in biological and toxic weapons control , said : " i do n't think anyone in the uk thinks foot-and-mouth was a deliberate outbreak .

' vulnerable livestock ' other farmers objected on monday to illegal imports over fears an epidemic like foot-and-mouth could be repeated in the future .
nfu cymru president hugh richards called for more resources for current import controls at the labour conference in brighton .
he believes the contaminated imports were the most likely source of the current epidemic .
many farmers believe foot-and-mouth originated from overseas " it does appear that the foot-and-mouth outbreak got into newcastle originally via some illegal foods which entered the country , " said mr richards .
he said that changes in licensing procedures for farmers wanting to move livestock had proved to be a " shambles . "

the scheme fulfils one of the campaign pledges made by the prime minister , thaksin shinawatra , who was elected to office in january .
trial period has revealed problems with the scheme the project - aimed at the poor , and those not receiving private health care - entitles patients to visit a doctor for less than $ 1 per visit .
but many doubts remain about what services the scheme can provide , and whether the country is able to afford it .
cut-price , universal health care was one of the key electoral promises that helped mr shinawatra to a landslide victory at the polls last january .
millions of low-income people - especially in the rural provinces - were wooed by the idea that a visit to the doctor would , in future , cost no more than 30 thai baht - the equivalent of about $ 0.67 .
teething problems the scheme has already been on trial in various parts of the country and ministers have declared their satisfaction .
cut-price health-care promise helped pm to landslide election victory but the trial period has revealed numerous teething problems , not to mention the deeper financial frailties of an idea that owed much to political expediency .
in order to qualify , prospective beneficiaries have to obtain a special gold card from their local medical authority - a process which can prove laborious .
but the real complaints have occurred at the hospitals chosen to provide the service .
while many mundane ailments have no doubt been satisfactorily dealt with , critics say patients with more severe health conditions tend to find that 30 baht does n't go very far .
full costs newspapers report people with tumours being told they must pay the full cost of treatment .
people suffering from long-term illnesses like hiv-aids say they receive poor service , or are excluded from the scheme altogether .
the basic flaw seems to be that not enough government money has been allocated to make the scheme truly universal .
and with the thai economy in the doldrums , there is little prospect of extra funding being found in the foreseeable future .

mr jones , 58 , will hold the chairmanship acting as wales 's " ambassador at large " for the next three years .
he takes over the position vacated by sir david rowe-beddoe who is retiring in december after nine years at the top .
the wda is tasked with steering the long-term economic regeneration of wales both in helping indigenous companies and attracting foreign investors .
it was also a key player in the recent success of attracting the prestigious ryder cup 2010 to wales .
mr jones will work alongside the agency 's new chief executive , the former head of welsh water , graham hawker .
first minister rhodri morgan has warmly welcomed mr jones ' appointment , describing him as ' a home-grown welsh success story . '
originally from corwen in north wales , mr jones launched penn , the international pharmaceuticals company based at tredegar in south east wales in the early 1980s after being " fast-tracked " by the wellcome foundation .

he suggested that with stronger powers , the security services might have detected some of the 11 suicide hijackers who are now known to have passed through the uk on their way to the us .
but caspar bowden of the foundation for information policy research argues that the main methods suggested for dealing with criminal use of internet encryption are fatally flawed : following the terrible events of 11 september , jack straw has described opponents of the internet surveillance legislation he enacted last year as " naïve " .
both government and broadcasters have framed the debate as a platitudinous " balance " between civil liberties and public safety .
the main thrust of criticism against the rip act is that it is completely ineffective but this was always a false dichotomy - the main thrust of criticism against the rip act is that it is completely ineffective .
four methods have been suggested for dealing with criminal use of encryption .
three are fatally flawed , but more importantly , they try to solve the wrong problem .
the ' back-door ' all encryption would be prohibited except an officially sanctioned version which contains a secret weakness allowing all traffic to be broken .
flaw : if the secret of the backdoor is ever leaked , the security of the entire communications infrastructure would be blown wide open and could not be repaired or quickly replaced .
' key escrow ' everybody using encryption must deposit a copy of their key in a huge database .
any particular message could thus be unscrambled , under warrant .
flaw : an encrypted message is like a letter in an impregnable envelope , which can itself be enclosed in another envelope .
without opening the outer envelope , it is impossible to know whether a particular message has already been encrypted with an undeclared key .
moreover , the vast majority of computer scientists believe that a global integrated system to escrow billions of keys is operationally infeasible .
power to demand decryption the rip act gives powers to demand decryption of any message or data , whether or not a person is suspected of any crime .
flaw : if you are falsely accused and have forgotten your password , you could be jailed for two years without a shred of evidence , unless the judge believes you .
an encrypted message is totally opaque - nothing can be inferred about the contents which would help a court rationally separate the innocent from the guilty .
and a terrorist is obviously not going to surrender a key to evidence which would lead to conviction on a much more serious charge .
attack the end-points if the device either sending or receiving the message is accessible , then it can be bugged in hardware software , or possibly hacked remotely .
intelligence agencies and the military are unlikely to trust the police with these black arts , which will need unprecedentedly stringent supervision , since their use would corrupt the legal validity of any chain of evidence .
computer scientists and security specialists understand the seriousness of what is at stake , and have wrestled with these dilemmas for a decade with no breakthrough .
the logic for rejecting the first three options is unshaken .
the fourth may often be impractical .
if you want to stop terrorist cells communicating via the internet , dismantle it none of these options can prevent hiding of information or steganography .
spies and terrorists have long used tradecraft such as chalk marks on a park bench , or everyday language with a veiled meaning .
in cyberspace , these equate to an innocent phrase in a chat-room , or weaving the bits comprising a message into a sound or picture file so it can not be detected .
without knowing who and what to look for , it is impossible to screen for every variation .
those who want a nostalgic return to the era of phone-tapping are either naïve or impervious to reason .
the only way to stop terrorist cells communicating via the internet is to disinvent it .
encryption is irrelevant .
