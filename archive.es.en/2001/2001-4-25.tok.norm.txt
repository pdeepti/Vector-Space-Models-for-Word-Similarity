bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- possible autism test for newborns low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 25 april , 2001 , 05:55 gmt 06:55 uk possible autism test for newborns the origins of autism are little understood a blood test at birth could reveal whether a child is likely to develop autism or suffer mental retardation , claim researchers .
normally these conditions can not be diagnosed until later in childhood , when their effects on the child are already pronounced .
autism is a developmental disorder which means , in many cases , that children have problems with social interaction , and problems with verbal and non-verbal communication .
children who have mental retardation have significantly delayed development and low iq scores .
we ... hope it will lead to better ways to treat and perhaps prevent autism dr karin nelson , researcher although there are as yet no treatments which can prevent or effectively treat either of these conditions , scientists at the us national institute of neurological disorders and stroke say the finding could help doctors develop them .
the study was made possible by a huge archive of infant blood stored by the california department of health services .
researchers were able to compare concentrations of key proteins in the newborn blood of children with autism , to those who developed normally .
elevated levels of the proteins - all growth factors associated with neural development - appeared to be linked to later diagnosis of autism or retardation .
growth factors the team believe that not only do the growth factors play a key role in development of the central nervous system , but also that too much of them may disrupt the normal process by which a cell develops into the correct type and moves to the right area , and dies at the right time .
children who suffered from cerebral palsy , another disorder linked to faulty early neural development , did not have elevated levels of the proteins .
dr karin nelson , the senior investigator for the study , said : " finding that the normal regulators of brain development were different in children with autism from normal controls in the first days of life opens an exciting new avenue of research .
" we think this work will be a step to better understanding to biologic basis of autism and hope it will lead to better ways to treat and perhaps prevent autism . "
the origins of autism are still controversial , with a small number of scientists suspicious about the role of a combined measles , mumps and rubella -lrb- mmr -rrb- vaccine , usually given at approximately 16 months of age .
no damning evidence the bulk of scientific opinion suggests there is no damning evidence linking autism to the jab , and the uk authorities have insisted that it is safe .
the number of children diagnosed with some sort of autistic spectrum disorder has increased sharply over the past decade .
advocates of the mmr theory say that this rise may at least be partly attributed to the introduction of the combined vaccine , whereas others say that improved awareness of autism means that many cases which might have been missed in the past are now being identified .
dr lorna wing , a consultant psychiatrist at the national autistic society centre for social & communication disorders in the uk , said : " a biological test for autism would be extremely helpful .
we look forward to hearing more information about the findings . "

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- fungus drug could save kidney patients low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 25 april , 2001 , 05:55 gmt 06:55 uk fungus drug could save kidney patients kidney transplant patients need drugs to stop rejection a drug developed from a fungus found on a remote pacific island could improve the long-term survival chances of kidney transplant patients .
the drug , rapumune is named after the local word for easter island -lrb- rapu nui -rrb- .
it is launched in the uk on wednesday .
the new generation of anti-rejection drugs have the potential to improve graft survival mr robert johnson , manchester royal infirmary trials have suggested that the drug could reduce the problem of organ rejection by as much as two-thirds .
the drug also appears to have fewer side effects than other immunosuppressants .
the only way to treat patients with end-stage kidney failure is with dialysis or transplantation .
transplantation is a more effective treatment than dialysis , and therefore results in an improved quality of life for patients .
rejection mr robert johnson said the drug could be a significant breakthrough patients who are given a new kidney have to take drugs for the rest of their lives to stop the body 's immune system from rejecting the donor organ .
however , the drugs can damage the kidney themselves , and in many cases this ultimately leads to the failure of the donor organ .
when this happens the patient has to go back onto dialysis and join the waiting list for another transplant .
as there is a chronic shortage of donor organs , there is no guarantee that another organ will become available before the patient dies .
while 1,600 kidney transplants were carried out last year , 5,000 patients were still waiting for a donor organ .
rapamune suppresses the immune system in a different way to existing treatments .
transplant surgeon mr robert johnson , of manchester royal infirmary , said the new drug represented a " significant breakthrough " .
he said : " the biggest problems we have at the moment are not having enough organs for transplantation and the long-term side effects of the drugs that we use in order to keep those grafts going .
" to have a drug that is hopefully equally powerful , but does not cause kidney damage would be a big advantage and hopefully would lead to longer life of the kidney . "

eric nicoli , emi chairman , is close to ending the talks because of the delay in gaining regulatory approval , the daily telegraph newspaper quoted unnamed industry sources as saying .
the newspaper quoted one person close to the talks as saying : " emi and bertelsmann have got on fine .
the trouble is that it is hard to find a way of doing the deal in such a way that does n't remove all value from it . "
the report came one day after thomas middelhoff , bertelsmann chief executive , said both sides remained as committed as ever to the deal .
frustrated " in reality , it 's been a done deal since october .
what we need to do now is find a workable situation anti-trust-wise , " he told reuters in an interview .
" both sides desperately want to realise this merger . "
the daily telegraph said emi investors had become frustrated with the regulatory process and were coming to regard it as an unwanted distraction .
analysts say bertelsmann had , for long , eyed a major position among music labels but had few possible acquisition targets .
emi and warner music previously scrapped their plans for a £ 14bn merger after regulators looked set to demand a host of heavy concessions as the price for approving it .
bertelsmann reportedly sounded out european commission anti-trust officials about the implications of any deal with emi before proceeding .
final effort there are not thought to have been any formal talks with either the commission or the federal trade commission in the us .
using consultants , lawyers and other intermediaries , bertelsmann is believed to have argued that the issues that sunk the proposed emi-warner tie-up no longer apply given big changes in the media industry in the past year .
among these have been the creation of the giant groups aol time warner and vivendi universal .
the daily telegraph said emi and bertelsmann would make a final effort to satisfy regulators but the most likely outcome remained an announcement within two weeks that the deal was off .

eric nicoli , emi chairman , is close to ending the talks because of the delay in gaining regulatory approval , the daily telegraph newspaper quoted unnamed industry sources as saying .
the newspaper quoted one person close to the talks as saying : " emi and bertelsmann have got on fine .
the trouble is that it is hard to find a way of doing the deal in such a way that does n't remove all value from it . "
the report came one day after thomas middelhoff , bertelsmann chief executive , said both sides remained as committed as ever to the deal .
frustrated " in reality , it 's been a done deal since october .
what we need to do now is find a workable situation anti-trust-wise , " he told reuters in an interview .
" both sides desperately want to realise this merger . "
the daily telegraph said emi investors had become frustrated with the regulatory process and were coming to regard it as an unwanted distraction .
analysts say bertelsmann had , for long , eyed a major position among music labels but had few possible acquisition targets .
emi and warner music previously scrapped their plans for a £ 14bn merger after regulators looked set to demand a host of heavy concessions as the price for approving it .
bertelsmann reportedly sounded out european commission anti-trust officials about the implications of any deal with emi before proceeding .
final effort there are not thought to have been any formal talks with either the commission or the federal trade commission in the us .
using consultants , lawyers and other intermediaries , bertelsmann is believed to have argued that the issues that sunk the proposed emi-warner tie-up no longer apply given big changes in the media industry in the past year .
among these have been the creation of the giant groups aol time warner and vivendi universal .
the daily telegraph said emi and bertelsmann would make a final effort to satisfy regulators but the most likely outcome remained an announcement within two weeks that the deal was off .
