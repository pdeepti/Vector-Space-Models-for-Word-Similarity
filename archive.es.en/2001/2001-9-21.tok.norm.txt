the agreement came after us president george w bush , in an address to congress , promised that " we will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying with direct assistance during this emergency " .
us airlines and plane maker boeing have cut more 100,000 jobs since the attacks , which has prompted a severe fall-off in trade .
continental has said it will go bankrupt without government aid .
aircraft were grounded for several days after the atrocities , and carriers have had to cut back schedules by 20 % or more because of the declining number of air travellers .
sky high deal the package includes $ 5bn in direct grants to the airlines to compensate them for the losses suffered after the attack and $ 10bn in loan guarantees .
the aid comes on top of $ 3bn to upgrade security in airplanes and airports included in $ 40bn emergency spending that congress approved last week .
european union officials said on thursday they would be looking closely at the us aid package , to see if they need to be matched in europe .
" we do not want a situation where european airlines are placed in a disadvantageous position , " transport commissioner loyola de palacio said .
ms de palacio is scheduled to meet her us counterpart norman mineta in washington on monday .
the house of representatives is expected to approve the package , which also provides some liability protections for the airlines , on friday and the senate was expected to swiftly follow suit .
' future threatened ' airlines would also get war risk insurance for domestic flights , which currently only covers international routes .
delta air lines chairman leo mullin told the senate commerce committee on thursday that without government help , " the future of aviation is threatened . "
he indicated that several major airlines are on the verge of bankruptcy .
the investment firm morgan stanley , in a letter to treasury secretary paul o 'neill said there will be " no functioning capital markets for the us airline industry " unless the government provides " relief from what would surely be bankruptcy-inducing liability claims against carriers for collateral damage and loss of life " from the attacks .
while the two airlines involved in the hijackings , united and american , would be responsible for suits filed by the families of passengers on the planes , but the government would compensate victims on the ground .

the company hired by the city council to run the site in ashton vale has pulled out .
now the formal establishment of the camp could be delayed by up to a year travelling people have been resident at south liberty lane for 40 years .
local opposition last year bristol city council bought the two-and-a-half-acre site for about £ 300,000 and appointed a firm to look after it .
the council wants to create the city 's first permanent camp for travellers which has the facilities they need and is properly managed .
but the plans have met with opposition from local residents , who say they were not consulted about the changes .
a public meeting was held on thursday night by the ashton vale action group .

kielder forest in northumberland provided a bridge between forest fragments , allowing an influx of new genes carried by " foreign " squirrels .
scientists at newcastle university have found the genetic composition of cumbria 's red squirrel population changed in the 1980s as a result .
the researchers , led by marie hale , said the findings had major implications for conservation management .
genetic mixing red squirrels live in isolated patches of forest , which would normally prevent genetic mixing between populations .
kielder forest was planted in the 1920 's but the growth of the kielder forest , which was planted in the 1920s , started to form a link between squirrel populations by the 1960s .
the researchers suggested that man-made alterations on a landscape could result in genetic changes in animal and plant populations .
they studied genetic markers in 102 dried red-squirrel skins collected in northern england and southern scotland .
according to their genetic " hallmarks " , they were assigned to northern , eastern or western forest fragments .
' stepping stone patches ' the study found that cumbrian samples , or the western region , collected after the 1980s , were significantly different from earlier ones .
kielder forest prompted a north to west squirrel migration , which changed the cumbrian population .
the findings are reported in the journal science .
the researchers wrote : " the northern genes have leap-frogged through hundreds of forest fragments in a period of 20 years , demonstrating the use of stepping stone patches of forest by red squirrels . "

but the growth of the kielder forest , which was planted in the 1920s , started to form a link between squirrel populations by the 1960s .
the researchers suggested that man-made alterations on a landscape could result in genetic changes in animal and plant populations .
they studied genetic markers in 102 dried red-squirrel skins collected in northern england and southern scotland .
according to their genetic " hallmarks " , they were assigned to northern , eastern or western forest fragments .
' stepping stone patches ' the study found that cumbrian samples , or the western region , collected after the 1980s , were significantly different from earlier ones .
kielder forest prompted a north to west squirrel migration , which changed the cumbrian population .
the findings are reported in the journal science .
the researchers wrote : " the northern genes have leap-frogged through hundreds of forest fragments in a period of 20 years , demonstrating the use of stepping stone patches of forest by red squirrels . "

the deal , which will provide gm with major tax breaks , will see the us-based auto giant pay $ 400m for a 67 % stake in a joint holding company .
but the us carmaker has managed to avoid taking over daewoo 's largest plant in pupyong , from where trade unions have led opposition to the takeover .
only four of 16 plants are included in the deal , raising doubts over the jobs of many of daewoo 's 50,000-plus employees .
the ' memorandum of understanding ' signed in seoul on friday with creditors of daewoo represents a boost for an economic grwoth programme being pursued by the south korean government , it also gives gm a foothold in the asian production market .
gm , and its italian-partner fiat , said they planned to sign a binding agreement before year 's end after a final due diligence .
tax deal a company will be set-up to take over daewoo motor , in which daewoo 's creditors , led by the state-run korean development bank , will invest $ 197m and hold the remaining 33 % .
the deal requires the south korean government to provide tax breaks for the new company , lowering corporate rates .
exempting the firm from car excise taxes for up to six months .
the new company will allow gm to break into south korea 's closed auto market , and assist the firm 's development into china , which us auto giants see as one of their key future growth areas .
overseas operations gm will also takeover 22 overseas daewoo subsidiaries , along with manufacturing facilities in egypt and vietnam .
the pupyong production line will remain open , providing vehicles , engines and other components to the new company .
gm said it might buy the pupyong some time in the future .
daewoo motor currently produces 2 million vehicles a year at 11 plants at home and abroad and the holding company is expected to have annual revenues of $ 5bn .

the north west rail passengers ' committee will condemn the company for increasing some fares by up to 80 % over the past three years .
many passengers are seriously disadvantaged by this piece of exploitation brendan o 'friel , chairman of passenger watchdog in its annual report published on friday , the passenger group will accuse virgin trains of exploiting thousands of passengers who use the west coast line .
the report is expected to demand government legislation restrict future fare increases .
virgin trains has seen the report but has ruled out cheaper fares for early morning travellers .
the passenger watchdog 's chairman , brendan o 'friel , told bbc radio 4 's today programme that the high fare increases were unacceptable .
" we think this is entirely unjustified and many passengers are seriously disadvantaged by this piece of exploitation , " he said .
increases unacceptable this is the first case of a train company being referred to the regulator for monopoly abuse .
in the last three years the cost of a first-class return ticket between manchester and london during peak time has risen from £ 140 to £ 252 , an 80 % increase .
" in the last year we have a dreadful time from the trains - one of the worst since the war , " said mr o 'friel .
the passenger group will ask the regulator to investigate and if the case is proven to freeze fares or insist that they be reduced .
" monopoly exploitation is against the law in this country and virgin is monopolising its position , " he said .
the company says that , together with railtrack , it has spent billions of pounds on upgrading the west coast route and has invested heavily in new trains .
the west coast main line links glasgow with london .
train upgrades virgin already has plans to upgrade the trains on the line by introducing tilting trains by 2003 .
the trains could travel at speeds of up to 140mph , cutting a journey between london and manchester to just over one-and-a-half hours .
virgin trains was criticised by passenger groups , politicians and rail unions when rail firms announced fare increases in april .
virgin trains ' increase of 9.8 % was the largest .
the company said it faced insolvency without the price rises and blamed railtrack for failing to pay adequate compensation for the network disruption caused by the hatfield tragedy .
earlier in the year virgin chief sir richard branson said he would " kick start " a rail recovery by offering half price fares throughout february . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's kevin bocquet " the report is expected to demand government legislation " nwrpc chairman brendan o 'friel " virgin ... are exploiting their monopoly position " see also : 09 jul 01 -pipe- uk testing the trains of the future 31 aug 01 -pipe- uk passengers condemn rail chaos 05 apr 01 -pipe- business fares rise sparks fury 07 feb 01 -pipe- business virgin 's cut-price rail chaos 11 jan 01 -pipe- business branson halves rail fares 31 mar 00 -pipe- uk railtrack 's £ 52bn upgrade plan 06 mar 00 -pipe- business virgin 's 200mph east coast vision internet links : virgin trains railtrack office of the rail regulator the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories now : postcode lottery in gp services leanne killer jailed for life tories attack brixton drugs scheme straw defends arms sales change ivf mix-up heads for court police shoot man on the m6 new challenge excites venables judge urges life sentence shake-up links to more uk stories are at the foot of the page .

a team of researchers , including some from london 's institute of child health , has uncovered two genes that work together to contribute to a rare genetic disorder called bardet-biedl syndrome .
it only affects one in 50,000 babies born in the uk , but can cause obesity , progressive blindness and kidney failure .
however , it is the first time that progress of this type has been made in a disease with a complex genetic root .
previously , scientists have managed to unravel only diseases caused by mutations in a single gene , such as huntingdon 's disease and cystic fibrosis .
many different genes have emerged as likely candidates to trigger a variety of common illnesses - but scientists can not piece together exactly which ones are important , and in which combination .
this finding increases hope that one day , even more complicated genetic trails can be followed to explain the causes of common diseases which are thought to be produced by as many as six or more mutated genes working in combination .
small step one of the researchers , dr philip beales , from the institute , told bbc news online : " in the last decades , we have been successful in identifying a lot of single genes which are linked to disease .
" however , it is acknowledged that many more common illnesses such as asthma have several genes involved .

a team of researchers , including some from london 's institute of child health , has uncovered two genes that work together to contribute to a rare genetic disorder called bardet-biedl syndrome .
it only affects one in 50,000 babies born in the uk , but can cause obesity , progressive blindness and kidney failure .
however , it is the first time that progress of this type has been made in a disease with a complex genetic root .
previously , scientists have managed to unravel only diseases caused by mutations in a single gene , such as huntingdon 's disease and cystic fibrosis .
many different genes have emerged as likely candidates to trigger a variety of common illnesses - but scientists can not piece together exactly which ones are important , and in which combination .
this finding increases hope that one day , even more complicated genetic trails can be followed to explain the causes of common diseases which are thought to be produced by as many as six or more mutated genes working in combination .
small step one of the researchers , dr philip beales , from the institute , told bbc news online : " in the last decades , we have been successful in identifying a lot of single genes which are linked to disease .
" however , it is acknowledged that many more common illnesses such as asthma have several genes involved .
" this is a small step towards discovering how these work . "
he predicted it could still be 50 years before the full picture emerged .

the north west rail passengers ' committee will condemn the company for increasing some fares by up to 80 % over the past three years .
many passengers are seriously disadvantaged by this piece of exploitation brendan o 'friel , chairman of passenger watchdog in its annual report published on friday , the passenger group will accuse virgin trains of exploiting thousands of passengers who use the west coast line .
the report is expected to demand government legislation restrict future fare increases .
virgin trains has seen the report but has ruled out cheaper fares for early morning travellers .
the passenger watchdog 's chairman , brendan o 'friel , told bbc radio 4 's today programme that the high fare increases were unacceptable .
" we think this is entirely unjustified and many passengers are seriously disadvantaged by this piece of exploitation , " he said .
increases unacceptable this is the first case of a train company being referred to the regulator for monopoly abuse .
in the last three years the cost of a first-class return ticket between manchester and london during peak time has risen from £ 140 to £ 252 , an 80 % increase .
" in the last year we have a dreadful time from the trains - one of the worst since the war , " said mr o 'friel .
the passenger group will ask the regulator to investigate and if the case is proven to freeze fares or insist that they be reduced .
" monopoly exploitation is against the law in this country and virgin is monopolising its position , " he said .
the company says that , together with railtrack , it has spent billions of pounds on upgrading the west coast route and has invested heavily in new trains .
the west coast main line links glasgow with london .
train upgrades virgin already has plans to upgrade the trains on the line by introducing tilting trains by 2003 .
the trains could travel at speeds of up to 140mph , cutting a journey between london and manchester to just over one-and-a-half hours .
virgin trains was criticised by passenger groups , politicians and rail unions when rail firms announced fare increases in april .
virgin trains ' increase of 9.8 % was the largest .
the company said it faced insolvency without the price rises and blamed railtrack for failing to pay adequate compensation for the network disruption caused by the hatfield tragedy .
earlier in the year virgin chief sir richard branson said he would " kick start " a rail recovery by offering half price fares throughout february .

the scientists say that by 2025 , combat gear will have evolved so that soldiers will be able to sense an oncoming attack , change chameleon-like to blend in with their surroundings and make temperature adjustments .
we are in the early stages of anticipating how nanotechnology will revolutionise army equipment tom tassinari , us army soldier system center nanotechnology will play a major role in the development of the new generation of army uniforms and equipment .
this is the science of manipulating particles smaller than 100 nanometres , or one-hundredth of the width of a human hair strand , to create new materials .
by changing the properties of materials , such as by introducing tiny nanoparticle reinforcements into polymers , nanotechnology will enable such advances as making helmets 40-60 % lighter and creating tent-fabric that repairs itself when it rips .
lighter , breathable uniforms with the advent of nanotechnology , chemical protective overgarments , which shield soldiers against hazardous chemicals and deadly micro-organisms , will enter a new phase of development .
the new uniforms will be breathable and 20 % lighter in weight than the standard battle-dress overgarment .
" we are in the early stages of anticipating how nanotechnology will revolutionise army equipment , " says tom tassinari , a scientist with the soldier system center in natick , massachusetts .
" research in the field is already showing tremendous promise . "
the us army 's budget for basic science and technology research stands at a modest $ 8.8 billion -lrb- or 2.7 % -rrb- out of a total budget of $ 328.9 billion for fy 2002 .
but nanotechnology is one of the military 's key areas of focus , alongside chemical and biological agent detection and high-energy lasers .
in addition to awarding $ 8.75 million in research awards to academic institutions conducting nanotechnology research this year , the department of defense recently announced its intention to create a top-tier nanotechnology research centre , the institute for soldier nanotechnology .
over five years , the institute , which will develop within an existing university , is expected to receive $ 50 million in funding .
commercial potential the commercial applications of nanotechnology are of particular interest to the scientists at us army soldier system center .
we aim to help soldiers do everything they need to do with a smaller amount of equipment and a lighter load dr mike sennett , us army soldier system center unlike the internet - which dr mike sennett , a member of the materials science team at the center , says was developed within the military rather than the marketplace because " it had no obvious commercial potential at the time " - nanotechnology is being deployed in many corners of the commercial sector .
" there 's much more commercial drive for something like a computer switching device based on a single carbon nanotube , " says dr sennett .
from toyota cars to nike trainers , nanotechnology has enhanced products and saved money .
toyota developed one of the earliest uses of the technology in the early 1990s , when material scientists working for the company created a nanocomposite material out of reinforced nylon .
the material withstood car engine heat and was cheaper to produce than other forms of high-performance plastic , so it was readily adopted .
at nike , nanoengineered soles have increased the cushioning properties of the company 's training shoes .
future goal for the army , developments across the commercial sector mean potential corporate partnerships and the possibility of adapting uses of nanotechnology for military purposes .
" a lot of research is going on and we are paying attention to how the materials are progressing and how they might be used within the army , " says mr tassinari .
for the army scientists , the goal for the future remains clear .
" with nanotechnology , we can add properties to materials that were n't there before , " says dr sennett .
" we aim to help soldiers do everything they need to do with a smaller amount of equipment and a lighter load . "
