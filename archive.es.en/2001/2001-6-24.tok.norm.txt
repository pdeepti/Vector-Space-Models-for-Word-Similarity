i still have more to say cuban president fidel castro he walked buoyantly into the television studios in his customary military uniform , looking relaxed .
the president joked with journalists present , saying he had simulated his own death in order to see what his funeral would be like .
he then went on to finish the speech he had started earlier in the day , attacking washington 's policy towards cuba .
fidel castro , who will be 75 in august , paid special attention to the five cubans who were recently sentenced to long prison terms in miami for spying on the united states .
earlier in the day , he had been addressing tens of thousands of people at a rally on the outskirts of havana , when he appeared to faint .
he was led from the stage while his foreign minister , felipe perez roque , tried to reassure the crowd .
rumours president castro returned about 10 minutes later to say he was all right .
" i still have more to say , " he said and promised to finish his speech later in the day .
the incident will add fuel to rumours that president castro is not well .
the cuban authorities have always insisted that he is fit and healthy , and are sensitive to any suggestion that he may not have a strong grip on the post he has held for more than 40 years .
fidel castro has a reputation as a hard worker who rests little .
his supporters and his enemies , both inside and outside cuba , will now be scrutinising the president even more closely to ascertain how well he really is .
