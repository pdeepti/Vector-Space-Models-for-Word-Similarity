up to 7,000 culled animals are being consumed by flames at a huge incineration site near holsworthy , devon .
environmental pressure group friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- has raised concerns about the level of carcinogenic dioxins which have been released by animal pyres all over the uk since the foot-and-mouth outbreak began .
the department of environment has confirmed that fires lit during the first six weeks of the foot-and-mouth crisis released 63g of dioxins into the atmosphere - 18 % of the uk 's average annual emissions .
crisis in the uk cases on sunday : 10 total confirmed cases : 1,439 foe has also called on the prime minister , tony blair , to explain why warnings were ignored about the risks of a foot-and-mouth outbreak .
it said the government was repeatedly warned by eu experts that intensive farming and large scale animal movements would increase the risk of spreading foot-and-mouth and other diseases .
confronted on monday foe will also ask whether agriculture minister nick brown was told of the warnings from the un food and agriculture organisation and the eu scientific committee on animal health and animal welfare - and if so , whether he alerted his cabinet colleagues .
the call comes on the day that mr brown and chief vet jim scudamore must also face a grilling about their handling of the crisis before a panel of mps on the commons agriculture select committee .
mr brown is expected to be quizzed about the government 's change of heart on vaccination , as well as on delays in the introduction of the army .
meanwhile defence secretary geoff hoon has denied the pyres are risking public health , and said studies showed the dioxin releases were " the equivalent of two bonfire nights " .
we will not take actions that will jeopardise public health , but there are no risk-free options geoff hoon but he conceded that , in devon , animal carcasses had been left rotting in the open air because of difficulties finding means of disposing of them , and said officials were working " round the clock " to provide a mass burial site .
twelve more pyres in cumbria are burning or smouldering , but there will be no more built until the department of health reaches a decision on the danger caused by burning carcasses .
a maff spokesman said : " we are awaiting further instruction from the department of health on , if and how , it is safe to continue . "
the department has already ordered the dismantling of a pyre of 750 sheep and cows in cumbria because it is close to a residential area .
new cases a fourth case of the disease has been confirmed in northern ireland , and nine more cases across the rest of the uk , bringing the national total to 1,439 .
one of the latest outbreaks is half-a-mile from the home of conservative leader william hague , on a farm in catterick , north yorkshire .
a new case was also confirmed on a farm at skewen , near swansea - an area of wales previously free of the disease .
on sunday evening more than 2,600 farms in parts of somerset , wiltshire , berkshire and hampshire released from restrictions after the regions were declared infection-free .
the move brought to 9,267 the number of farms where restrictions have been lifted over the past five days .

the rsc commissioned a survey from mori to mark the culmination of this england : the histories - a cycle of shakespeare 's plays about uk history that they are staging this year .
mori found that people feel shakespeare 's plays reflect on their time in much in the way tv soaps make important statements about their society .
" the poll proves what we already know from the box office - that these plays are as relevant and exciting today as they were 400 years ago , " said the rsc 's artistic director adrian noble .
the eight plays in the rsc 's histories series - henry iv -lrb- part i and ii -rrb- , henry v , henry vi -lrb- parts i , ii and iii -rrb- , richard ii , richard iii - tackle issues like political sleaze , devolution and poll tax riots .
unique thrill researchers asked the public to choose a modern day equivalent to these plays and coronation street and eastenders came top of the list .
one third -lrb- 33 % -rrb- of those polled said eastenders was the contemporary drama which most had something to say about today 's society .
29 % opted for coronation street .
more than 40 % of those polled said they felt shakespeare 's history plays were relevant today , though 16 % disagreed with this .
the rsc are actively trying to increase that number - already a quarter of their audience is aged 19 and under , though that may be because many students are required to study shakespeare at school .
but noble is confident that they will be able to bring in a wide range of people into shakespeare 's work .
the fact that the season of shakespeare 's history plays at the barbican in london is sold out is a testament to that .
" if we can turn people on to the unique thrill of seeing a performance on stage , then a shakespeare performance will follow , " said noble .

unison health organiser jim devine said he was writing to the chief executive of the scottish health service to highlight the severity of the situation .
he said : " medical secretaries play a crucial role in ensuring that the government 's waiting list initiative meets its target .
" according to one prominent consultant in north glasgow , if medical secretaries go on strike ' acute services could collapse in three days ' .
" this is a scottish problem that needs a scottish solution and that is why i am writing to trevor jones , outlining options to resolve the dispute . "
' local issue ' mr devine added : " unison is now in formal dispute over the grading of medical secretaries in glasgow , lothian , fife , forth valley , argyll and clyde and lanarkshire .
" in other areas medical secretaries are requesting meetings with our officials to register disputes . "

" we are aware that local trust managers are in discussions with unison about the grading of medical secretaries and that at least one trust has introduced a fast track service to review medical secretaries ' posts where there is a dispute about grading .
" it 's important that these matters are considered and agreed locally . "
