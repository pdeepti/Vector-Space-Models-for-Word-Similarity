residents of tow law , county durham , are worried about toxins escaping from the inkerman site , which is close to two primary schools .
their concerns come at a time when government officials have warned of other potential health hazards posed by the disposal of foot-and-mouth carcasses .
meanwhile , local authorities in england are hoping to re-open most footpaths outside of foot-and-mouth protection zones over the bank holiday weekend .
the national trust also says the public will be able to gain access to nearly 500 of its sites , which have been shut until now .
foot-and-mouth facts total number of confirmed foot-and-mouth cases in the uk 1,640 - one new case on friday 3,030,000 animals slaughtered 73,000 animals awaiting slaughter 15,000 carcasses awaiting disposal the food standards authority said on friday that whole milk could possibly become contaminated with cancer-causing dioxins from pyres of slaughtered animals .
and a leading scientist warned there may be a danger of bse getting into water supplies in areas surrounding foot-and-mouth burial sites .
the risks of either of these eventualities is extremely slight , scientists say , but the news will have done little to allay health fears .
the tow law site is situated above 78 mine shafts , many of them filled with water .
at saturday afternoon 's protest , demonstrators will hand a petition to a ministry of agriculture -lrb- maff -rrb- representative , demanding the pit be closed .
' hidden ' cases the official number of foot-and-mouth cases now stands at 1,640 although according to reports the true number of farms infected with the virus is almost double this figure .
the daily telegraph says about 1,500 more cases exist among animals slaughtered as part of contiguous culls or " dangerous contacts " .
this , the paper quotes maff as saying , is a " significant " number which justifies the scale of the cull in which more than 3 million animals have been killed .
on friday , professor peter smith , a government advisor on bse and vcjd , raised fears that if cattle older than five years were buried , bse may enter drinking water .
he said that the risk of the transmission of the disease to humans could be increased dramatically - to one in 200,000 - if contaminated water was drunk .
the food standards agency is continuing to test milk from farms after fears that dioxins released by the burning animals could re-enter the food chain .
dioxin hazards however , it has stressed that bulk-bought milk such as that sold by supermarkets and dairies carries no additional risk to consumers .
high exposures to chemicals in the dioxin family have been associated with a variety of health problems , such as cancer , lowered sperm counts , behavioural problems and diabetes .
the chemicals are produced by many industrial processes which involve burning , and are even released in car exhaust fumes .
this affects only a very small number of people john krebbs , food standards agency in this case , it is suspected that the dioxins could have been released by the pyre , absorbed into grass , consumed by the cows in fields close by the pyres , then passed out in milk .
the agency began testing milk at farms close to the foot-and-mouth pyres , which experts warned could be releasing contamination into the surrounding countryside .
although final results have not yet been published , initial conclusions suggested elevated levels in farms within two kilometres of the pyres , which could lead to a slight increase in the " lifetime exposure " of drinkers to dioxins .
john krebbs , director of the food standards agency , said there was no reason for widespread concern .
" this affects only a very small number of people , " he said .
" we are very clear that people have the right to know what we know , when we know it . "
he said that the risk would only be confirmed by the results of more tests , to be completed within the next couple of weeks , and advised anyone worried about dioxins to drink semi-skimmed or skimmed milks , or dilute their untreated farm milk with supermarket or dairy milk .

the airline 's conditions of carriage have been rewritten to warn customers they will not be allowed to board their flights if they use " threatening , abusive or insulting words to ground staff or the crew " .
ba staff dealt with more than 200 cases of air rage last year , ranging from minor disagreements over smoking on board flights to more serious incidents resulting in a passenger being restrained .
personnel are said to believe too much attention has been given to problems which arise during flights , instead of tackling difficulties on the ground before passengers get as far as boarding their planes .
' common sense ' while there has been no increase in cases , the airline insists it will not tolerate passengers who put the safety of fellow travellers and the crew members at risk .
owen highley , a ba solicitor who helped to draw up the new guidelines , told the times newspaper : " if we think someone is going to be a disruptive passenger the most obvious thing to do is to deny them boarding .
" but there has to be common sense .
we are not going to ban from flight everybody who gets a bit stroppy . "
mr highley said the new conditions of carriage , set to come into force next month , had been written in simple terms so as not to confuse passengers by corporate language .
the times says that passengers banned from boarding their planes would not receive a refund of their ticket price unless it was a fully flexible fare .
those involved in the most serious incidents would face a lifetime ban .
george ryde , head of aviation at the transport and general workers ' union is quoted as saying : " we have been telling the airlines for some time that you can spot passengers who are likely to commit air rage from their behaviour at check-in . "

he will be the event 's most expensive speaker but organisers are confident his visit will generate income for the area , which has been hit by foot-and-mouth disease .
a massive security operation surrounds mr clinton 's visit to the 10-day festival , hosted every year by the mid-wales border town .
secret service agents and the metropolitan police have been helped by dyfed-powys police to put strict measures into place after the former president decided he would like to stage a walkabout in the town to meet visitors .
mr clinton - who is reported to command at least $ 100,000 per speech - will talk about conflict resolution and the language of diplomacy when he appears at the bbc wales world lecture at 1945bst .
his speech will be followed by a question and answer session .
on friday mr clinton , whose tour of britain and ireland began last week , received a warm welcome on his return to oxford university to open an institute for american studies .
he was accompanied by his daughter , chelsea , who is thought to be interested in studying at the university .
mccartney poetry organisers of mr clinton 's speech in hay say they could have sold the 1,300 tickets - costing £ 100 - several times over .
it has been estimated that his presence at the festival in the town which has a population of just 1,300 will bring an extra £ 1.5m into the area .
sir paul mccartney , who has recently published a book of poetry , will also be at the festival which attracts crowds from across the world .
authors booked to appear this year include louis de bernieres , margaret atwood , nick hornby , germaine greer and frank mccourt .
irish rock star van morrison is due to perform on 1 june .
as a result of nearby foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks , the festival has been moved from its usual farm site on the outskirts of hay to a less sensitive site in the town centre .
