the court acknowledged that some damages were justified to compensate commercial fishermen and others who suffered from the disaster - but recommended that a lower amount be set .
it 's a black day in the neighbourhood .
i 'm stunned .
i think this is going to be devastating to people fisherman riki ott lawyers for the alaskan fishermen and other plaintiffs said they still expected to win significant damages from the company , and would lodge new appeals if they considered the amount to be too low .
the exxon valdez tanker ran aground in prince william sound in 1989 , spilling millions of gallons of oil off alaska 's coast and polluting 1,610 km -lrb- 1,000 miles -rrb- of shoreline with disastrous consequences for fishing and the environment .
the $ 5bn award against exxon was ordered by a jury in alaska in 1994 , the largest punitive damages in history at the time .
despite exxon 's claims that the verdict was " completely unwarranted , unfair and excessive " , the award was repeatedly upheld last year by the us supreme court .
' already compensated ' the san francisco-based federal appeals court took a different view on wednesday , saying the amount was excessive in the light of recent supreme court decisions governing such awards .
" the plaintiffs here were almost entirely compensated for their damages years ago , " the panel said .
they were referring to $ 287m compensatory damages awarded to commercial salmon and herring fishermen during the 1994 trial .
" the punitive damages at issue were awarded to punish exxon , not to pay back the plaintiffs , " the court said in its unanimous decision .
the reduced charges should now be decided by a district court .
not the end the oil giant has argued that it should not have to pay any punitive damages , because it learnt its lesson , and spent more than $ 3bn to clean up the spill and settle lawsuits .
the plaintiffs argue that the $ 5bn award was appropriate given exxon 's " reckless conduct " and that of the tanker 's captain , joseph hazelwood .
one of the lawyers , david oesting , warned that this was not the end of the case .
" i do n't see this in the least as the end of the line .
we are going to get punitive damages in this case - the question is just how much , " he said .
back in alaska , local fisherman were shocked by the verdict .
" it 's a black day in the neighbourhood .
i 'm stunned .
i 'm totally stunned .
i think this is going to be devastating to people , just devastating , " said riki ott , a fisherman and environmentalist .

but general musharraf hoped the campaign in afghanistan would be short and once again called for a stop to the military strikes during the muslim holy month of ramadan .
one would certainly wish -lsb- the bombing -rsb- would not go on during ramadan because it will definitely have negative effects around the islamic world president pervez musharraf general musharraf is in paris on a diplomatic tour that will also take him to london and new york .
it is his first trip outside pakistan since the 11 september attacks and will end with an address the united nations general assembly on 10 november .
in paris , the general met french president jacques chirac and raised the issue of pakistan 's massive foreign debt and asked for international aid .
" france supports international aid efforts towards pakistan , notably in the programme of aid and reforms under discussion at the world trade organisation , " president chirac said in response .
pakistan is hoping to be rewarded for its support to the ongoing campaign against the taleban and has already received aid packages from the imf and the asian development bank .
earlier president musharraf made brief halts in istanbul and the iranian capital tehran .
he said he would discuss the issue of bombing during ramadan with us president george w bush when he arrives in the united states .
washington has so far refused to stop bombing afghanistan during ramadan in its continuing attempts to flush out osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network .
speaking in istanbul , general musharraf repeated his warning that the strategy could create serious diplomatic and political difficulties .
" one would certainly wish it would not go on during ramadan because it will definitely have negative effects around the islamic world , " he was quoted by the reuters news agency as saying .
islamabad has supported the us operation in afghanistan and given concrete help , but not without misgivings .
although the president 's position seems to have strengthened since the war began , he is clearly aware of the potential of continued bombing to stoke muslim hostility .
whirlwind tour on thursday president musharraf will have a working breakfast with french premier lionel jospin .
that is to be followed by discussions in london with british prime minister tony blair .
correspondents say his earlier meeting in iran may have been aimed at preparing the ground for a more substantial session at the un with iranian president , mohammad khatami .
tehran strongly opposes the us-led operation in afghanistan , and has also long been hostile to the taleban , who were helped into power by pakistan .
western diplomats say it is vital that pakistan and iran in particular agree to back a broad-based government representing all afghanistan 's ethnic groups .

quality and innovation are both being described as essential to help the industry get back on its feet .
the message comes from south west tourism as it gives out its awards for excellence .
ensuring tourism has a high profile has also been pointed out as necessary by the organisation .
the south west tourism awards for excellence are being used to help the keep the region in the national tourism spotlight .
the organisation 's chief executive , malcolm bell , said that this year more than ever the profile of tourism and the quality of the product in the region must be kept to the fore .
he said : " these awards are part of that process and celebrate the very best of what the south west has to offer .
" we know we have some of the top places to stay and visit and we have a unique appeal as a holiday destination . "
award winners several south west tourism businesses are also among the regional winners in the excellence in england awards .
they include percy 's in virginstow , which came first in the small hotel category and pennywell farm at buckfastleigh , which was named the region 's best small visitor attraction .
the double gate farm , godney , near wells in somerset , was named best bed and breakfast and trevornick holiday park in newquay , cornwall , won the best holiday park award .
the awards will be presented by tourism minister kim howells and celebrity noel edmunds at the national trust 's barrington court in somerset .
holiday record however , despite fears that foot-and-mouth would drive visitors away , some parts of devon reported having their best tourist season ever - possibly thanks to the disease .
at the height of the outbreak , there were fears that the crisis was putting 11,000 jobs at stake .
the county stood to lose an estimated £ 350m if a tourism recovery plan failed .
but some coastal holiday businesses had record numbers of customers , and enjoyed the boom into the autumn .
their success was believed to be partly due to holidaymakers being wary of venturing into the countryside .

after six cuts so far this year , the bank 's main interest rate stands at 4.5 % - considerably higher than the equivalents in the eurozone and united states .
but while the financial markets are unanimous in their expectation of a minimum quarter-point cut , the fundamental economic evidence in britain is decidedly mixed .
the rest of the world may be feeling the economic pinch in the wake of the us terror attacks , but most uk growth indicators are still persistently positive .
pressure mounts in the past few days , lobby groups have stepped up their campaign for a heavy cut in rates , mainly in order to bolster the flagging manufacturing sector , which has cut thousands of jobs since 11 september .
the trades union congress , the confederation of british industry and the british chambers of commerce all called on the mpc to introduce a half-point cut .
cbi director general digby jones said there would never be a stronger case for a cut , while tuc general secretary john monks said : " it is time to throw a lifeline to our exporters with a bigger cut in interest rates , giving us an economic shot in the arm and insulating us from the threat of global recession . "
mr monks said the rate cut should be followed by a " pre-budget for jobs " from chancellor gordon brown later this month .
foxed by fundamentals but as the mpc sifts through economic data , the case for a rate cut does not seem strong .
on 5 november , prime minister tony blair told a conference that uk economic fundamentals were " the strongest they have been in a generation " , and pointed to low inflation , high employment and robust public finances .
the battered manufacturing sector continues to call for rate cuts and other assistance , but much of the rest of industry seems in reasonable shape .
economic growth , although slowing slightly , at least remains positive - unlike in some other advanced economies .
more to the point , british shoppers continue to spend avidly .
the latest retail survey showed sales growth of 6 % year on year in october , precisely at the time when consumers around the world were tightening their belts .
the mpc may not have a brief to boost british manufacturing , but it is certainly concerned with the likely emergence of inflation , and booming retail sales are a key indicator of price rises to come .
exceptional circumstances but while such data would generally point towards flat - or even higher - interest rates , the current circumstances are exceptional .
the new global situation , it is felt , has changed the fundamentals upon which interest rate decisions are made .
the feeling within the mpc is certainly inclined towards lower rates .
its october meeting was unanimous in favour of a cut , and several members were lobbying for a half-point reduction .
that is partly because the mpc feels that the current rosy figures may in fact disguise problems ahead , as slowing european and us economies inevitably take their toll on british performance .
inflation , already tolerably low in the uk , will almost certainly fall further as demand slackens among britain 's recession-hit trading partners .
but it also stems from the fact that british interest rates are so much higher than those in comparable economies .
rate race in the us , the federal reserve has cut interest rates 10 times this year .
the main us rate is now 2 % , having been cut by 4.5 percentage points this year alone .
the differential in rates between britain and the us gives the mpc considerable leeway to cut uk rates without upsetting the currency markets .
britain 's interest-rate lead helps support the pound against the dollar , which suits some policy makers in the uk , but british rates have considerable room to fall while preserving that effect .
the mpc decision is expected at 1200 gmt , and will be followed three-quarters of an hour later by a rate decision from the european central bank .

toyota 's sales for the six months were 6,833.56bn yen , a rise of 6.4 % .
that figure was boosted by the strengthening dollar , making toyota 's cars more competitive in the vital north american market where sales grew strongly .

there was a storm of protest when the church charity announced on tuesday it was axing services - including closing 13 projects for children and young people - and making 120 workers redundant .
mrs hutt said the welsh assembly had not been informed of the charity 's closure plan ahead of the announcement .
she also said the assembly had not been asked for any kind of financial help ahead of the current crisis .
the archbishop of wales , rowan williams , resigned as vice-president of the charity in anger .
and the newly-established children 's commissioner for wales , peter clarke , said he would be seeking a rescue package .
the society says it has to save £ 6m across its entire operations in england and wales .
many of the society 's projects were set up in direct response to the waterhouse report on child abuse in north wales , serving some of the country 's most vunerable youngsters .
the welsh staff of the charity have vowed to fight on to try to save the charity 's operations in some form .
policy officer maria battle said the charitable work she and her colleagues had been undertaking was very important for young people .
" many of them do not trust statutory bodies , said ms battle .
the fight to try and salvage the charity 's operations has the support of one of its directors , three senior managers and the entire welsh staff , ms battle said .
however , ian sparks , the society 's chief executive , is expected to tell the minister at their meeting in cardiff bay on thursday that there is no other solution to the charity 's funding crisis the charity expects to finish the financial year with a deficit of £ 4m and , over the last four years , a deficit of £ 24m in total .
as things stand , 13 projects which offer help to children in care , and other vulnerable teenagers will close in july .
it seems unlikely that the society 's trustees will change their minds - the workers , and other child care experts in wales are campaigning for a new , independent advocacy service , employing some of the staff facing redundancy .

the airline was already struggling to survive after un sanctions , introduced to pressurise the taleban into handing over osama bin laden , forced it to stop flying overseas two years ago .
the air strikes have reportedly damaged several aircraft - boeings and antonovs - as well as putting a stop to its domestic flights .
now all 1,300 of ariana 's staff have been sacked .
that , said a un spokesman , has effectively put the airline out of business - 55 years after the american carrier , panam , sponsored its creation .
national institution after more than 20 years of war , ariana was probably the last remaining national institution left in afghanistan .
walking into its offices felt like entering a small slice of pre-war kabul .
many of the pilots and engineers were trained decades ago .
they were virtually the only afghan men still to wear trousers as part of their uniforms , after the taleban made the baggy shalwar kameez compulsory .
the need for technical prowess meant it was probably the only state organisation where educated afghans , rather than taleban were still in the majority .
the airline last made the headlines 18 months ago , when one of its planes was hijacked by afghan asylum seekers and forcibly flown to london .
the hijack was brought to an end when the cockpit crew made a daring escape from the plane .
during the long civil war , crews have kept the planes flying , even as the rockets fell .
but it seems there could be no fighting back against the american air campaign .
