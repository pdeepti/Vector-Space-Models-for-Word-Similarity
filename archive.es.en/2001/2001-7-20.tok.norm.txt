police were deployed on the streets of the capital , buenos aires , where workers blocked roads in anger at planned reductions in wages and pensions .
it was the second day of protests against the austerity measures , which argentina president fernando de la rua says are needed to balance the budget and avoid defaulting on the country 's $ 128bn debt .
a three-year recession has sapped the country 's ability to repay the debt and undermined investors ' confidence in the argentine economy .
many buses and trains failed to run , government offices remained largely empty , and hospitals dealt only with emergencies on thursday .
opposition unions were protesting against $ 1.4bn in cuts this year as the government aims for a zero deficit policy , spending no more than its revenues .
hugo moyano , head of the general workers confederation , the largest union organisation said argentina 's political and economic leaders were bent on destroying argentina and its workers .
" we are going to fight to keep them from punishing us , " he said .
government spokesman juan pablo baylac criticised the strikers , saying they " give nothing to argentine society " .
crisis an atmosphere of crisis has enveloped the country since argentine stocks tumbled last week on worries about the country 's long-term solvency .
in response , president de la rua announced an austerity package , including 13 % cuts in state salaries and pensions .
markets and investors have mostly welcomed the measures , but many argentines have found it harder to accept the seventh austerity plan in two years .
roughly a third of argentina 's 36 million population lives in poverty , and unemployment rose to over 16 % this year .
doubt is also growing over whether mr de la rua will be able to get the measures through congress .
as the protests swell on the ground , opposition legislators have said they will not support salary cuts , and there appears to be little more agreement within the government coalition .

responding to the government 's plans to radically " modernise " the secondary school system , this coalition has challenged the impression that comprehensives have been a failure .
and the report , comprehensive secondary education - building on success , says that over the last three decades the non-selective comprehensive model had seen a substantial raising of standards .
the report , published by the campaign for state education , also questions the government 's planned increase in specialist schools , which will be able to select up to a tenth of pupils on " aptitude " .
labour mp david chaytor , and member of the education select committee , said that if every school was given specialist status it could be a " recipe for chaos " , generating " logistical " problems for matching pupils to places .
admissions disputes which were already on the increase could be heightened by the increase in specialist schools , he said .
but mr chaytor , who has previously voted against the government over changes to disability benefits , played down any suggestion that this was evidence of a backbench rebellion brewing over education reform .
sink schools another mp and former teacher , paul holmes , says that creating a large number of specialist schools will create much more tension in the process of allocating secondary school places .
parental choice has already established preferences for certain , often over-subscribed schools , he says .
but mr holmes says that if perhaps 40 % of schools in an area are specialist schools - it will present a much more accentuated sense of schools to get into or to avoid .
and the liberal democrat mp , who is also now on the education select committee , says that those schools which are not specialists are at risk of being seen as " sink " schools .
the report , which argues that comprehensive education has achieved " levelling-up " rather than levelling-down , is the collective work of eight academics .
this includes professor richard pring , head of education at oxford university , dr anne west , director of the centre for education research at the london school of economics and professor clyde chitty , head of education at goldsmiths college , university of london .
" since comprehensive education was introduced , barriers to achievement for many young people have been removed , " the report concludes .
" assertions that ' selection works ' rely heavily on seeing only the winners in that sifting process .
a modern economy relies on a ' learning society ' , which is rooted in a much more ambitious and inclusive strategy . "
