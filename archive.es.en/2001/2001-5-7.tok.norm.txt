the sanctions are being put in place because of liberia 's apparent failure to sever ties with sierra leone 's rebel revolutionary united front -lrb- ruf -rrb- .
the movement has been accused of killing , raping and mutilating civilians over the last decade .
the world should know that these actions against us are unjust president taylor diamond exports from liberia will be banned , in an effort to halt the smuggling of gems from rebel-held areas in sierra leone .
foreign travel by senior liberian officials will also be restricted .
britain and the united states believe the liberian president , charles taylor , has been running guns to the rebels in exchange for so-called " blood diamonds " from the rich sierra leonean diamond fields .
african opposition un officials said the sanctions were designed to hit the president and his government ministers , rather than ordinary liberians .
the decision was based on a report last week from un secretary-general kofi annan .
he said information indicated liberia had not yet cut ties with the rebels , closed their bank accounts or expelled their leaders as the un security council demanded .
the largest un peacekeeping force in the world is deployed in sierra leone , as well as a uk military force assisting the army .
taylor : given a chance to co-operate but some west african nations , the very countries which will have to implement the sanctions , are opposed to them .
they think the measures could put mr taylor 's back to the wall and cause a nationalist backlash in liberia , which he could exploit .
the siege atmosphere the measures are likely to create , coupled with mr taylor 's strong grip on power in the capital , monrovia , seem bound to discourage investment and isolate the country , correspondents say .
' unfair ' liberia has yet to recover from a disastrous civil war in the early 1990s , and a new armed rebellion against mr taylor recently began in the north of the country .
mr taylor has described the sanctions as " unjust and unfair " .
the president said liberia had done everything to sever ties with the rebels , but the international community had not checked this .
thousands of people took to the streets of monrovia on saturday to protest against the sanctions .
second chance the un authorised the sanctions on 7 march , but delayed their implementation for two months to give mr taylor a chance to comply with its demands .
west african un ambassadors argued that they wanted the delay in order to monitor mr taylor 's willingness to co-operate .
the ruf has been fighting to take control of diamond fields in sierra leone since 1991 .
monrovia says it has been expelling ruf leaders , freezing the organisation 's assets and has banned the import of all diamonds without proper certification .
liberia is already under an arms embargo stemming from its 1989-1996 civil war .

the constitution unit believes that there is a need for a minister to be given overall charge of reforms , which include the second stage of house of lords reform and future devolution issues , such as the reduction in the number of msps and regional government in england .
the labour government won power having made much of plans for constitutional reform .
devolution to scotland was a major commitment , secured after the overwhelming " yes " vote in the referendum .
elected members reform of the house of lords was next .
the hereditary peers were kicked out , but there are still no concrete details for the second stage in which the lords will be replaced by elected members .
independent think tank the constitution unit , based at university college london , says the next stage of constitutional reform will depend on firm leadership , careful planning and political will .
but it warns there will be tensions - not least over proposals to reduce the number of msps at holyrood in line with the reduction in mps at westminster .
although it is included in the legislation , even some ministers are not convinced .
the think tank claims labour may struggle to deliver its promises , including electoral reform and a referendum on the euro and believes a cabinet office minister should be put in overall charge .
the main points of the constitution unit report are : the government must get moving on the referendum on the euro .
this will need to be held by autumn 2002 if euro notes and coins are to be introduced before the 2004/5 election .
lords reform is needed quickly to get members in place .
future devolution issues such as reducing the size of the scottish parliament , the funding formula for devolution and regional government , call for a joined-up approach .
the timetable for regional government in england depends on political will .
with strong commitment the new government could establish regional assemblies by 2004 .
labour has ruled out any early referendum on introducing a more proportional voting system until a review of the next pr elections in scotland and wales in 2003 has taken place .
