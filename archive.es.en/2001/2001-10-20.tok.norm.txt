customers at a shopping centre in wakefield will be asked for their prints before a credit card sale is completed .
the voluntary scheme at the ridings shopping mall begins on saturday and will spread to the rest of the county .
police have long struggled to tackle debit , credit and cheque card fraud .
annual cost criminals use stolen or cloned plastic bank cards to buy valuable goods which are retained or fenced later .
it is estimated that fraud of this sort costs shops and stores nearly £ 300m a year .
the pioneering scheme is aimed at providing a doublecheck on the identification of credit card shoppers in order to catch the crooks .
an inkpad will be kept by shop tills to allow customers to put a thumbprint on the receipt .
pin schemes if there is a query about the sale police will have a lead on identifying the potential fraudster .
in some european countries , it is common to be required to type in a pin when using credit cards .
critics say the west yorkshire measure betrays a big brother approach and may even breach human rights .
but west yorkshire police say no database will be kept and that only fraudsters need worry .
leaflets explaining the scheme will be distributed in the mall and in the weeks to come at all major shopping centres around the county .

it is a development of the c-130 hercules transport aircraft and as such is slow , flying at less than 300mph , but has a range of at least 1,500 miles without needing to refuel and can loiter over a combat area for some time .
the ac-130s are operated by the us air force 's special operations group , based at hurlburt field , florida .
they have several big guns projecting from the left side of the fuselage : either two 40mm cannons or a 25mm gatling gun that can fire up to 1,800 rounds per minute , depending on the version , and 40mm and 105mm cannons .
computerised although based on an old hercules transport plane , the ac-130 has one of the most complex aircraft weapon systems .
it uses television , infra-red and radar sensors to locate ground targets , even at night .
uniquely , in the latest type , the targeting computers can follow two separate targets with two different sensors and fire two different guns .
former crew members say that , in practice , the guns were never fired simultaneously - and the ammunition load was an issue , so it was used sparingly .
the newest ac-130u version - known as spooky ii - has twice the ammunition capacity .
large crew the aircraft has more than a dozen crew : pilot , co-pilot , navigator , fire control officer , electronic warfare officer , flight engineer , operators for its tv camera and infra-red detection set , a loadmaster , and four or five " gunners " - who reload the weapons which are normally controlled from the flight deck .
although regarded as a highly successful machine - used most recently in support of operations in panama , grenada , the gulf war and bosnia - its slowness and typical low operating altitude make it vulnerable to ground fire .
it does have a system that drops chaff and flares to counter radar and infra-red guided missiles .
there are also heat shields under the engines to try to mask them from heat-seeking missiles .
even so , one ac-130 was shot down in iraq by a surface-to-air missile .
the other recent loss was in somalia when , it is thought , a round exploded in one of the plane 's cannons .
there are 21 of the two types of ac-130 on " active duty " , according to the us air force .

a technician holds up a newly-made ciprofloxacin tablet at apotex canada announced on thursday that it was ordering almost a million doses of a cheaper alternative in response to the massive worldwide demand for the drug .
eight anthrax cases have now been confirmed in the united states , but thousands more people are taking cipro as a precaution .
but the german company bayer , which has a monopoly on cipro , says it can easily meet the demand for the drug in canada , and is concerned about the implications of ordering a cheap alternative .
canadian competitor the canadian government has ordered anti-anthrax pills from apotex inc , canada 's largest pharmaceutical company .
it 's not a matter of dollar and cents but the matter of availability in case of an outbreak of anthrax - do we let people die because of a patent ?
apotex chief executive jack kay " it sets a dangerous precedent to have a government bypass legislative framework and request apotex , who to date has been prevented by court order from producing ciprofloxacin , to fill an order for 900,000 tablets , " bayer 's legal counsel , neil belmore , told reuters news agency .
bayer already plans to triple production of cipro - also known as ciproxin outside the us and canada - to meet the increased demand .
but apotex promises to provide ciprofloxacin - the generic name for cipro - at 63 canadian cents cheaper per tablet than the c $ 2 that each of bayer 's pills cost .
" it 's not a matter of dollar and cents but the matter of availability in case of an outbreak of anthrax - do we let people die because of a patent ? "
apotex chief executive jack kay said .
he said that if apotex was found to be infringing on bayer 's patent then it would reimburse the german company on this order .
us considers alternatives the us government is also considering relaxing its patent laws to allow it to buy in cheaper alternatives to cipro .
and drug companies are already lining up to provide this service .
deepak chatterraj , the head of the us arm of india 's ranbaxy laboratories , told the bbc 's world business report that he was ready to start shipping in december at an " attractive " but unspecified price .
mr chatterraj said that he and other firms had been approached by a us senator , jack schumer , to ask about their readiness to supply anti-anthrax drugs if necessary .
but he denied that he had been approached directly by the us government .
the shares of many biotechnology companies have risen sharply over the past week in response to the growing fear of bioterrorism in the united states .

but how is this american-led war on terrorism going ?
is the military campaign changing and what is likely to happen next ?
a breakdown of operation enduring freedom so far : targets much of the bombing to date has been against so-called " fixed " targets .
these include barracks , training camps , airfields and air defences .
numerous other moveable targets have also been hit , including aircraft , tanks and other vehicles .
much of the taleban 's heavy equipment is thought to be of doubtful serviceability , but the pentagon has clearly worked on the assumption that some aircraft and missiles might work and targeted as much as it can find .
this allowed donald rumsfeld to announce , early on , that us jets had command of the skies .
in some areas , the original target lists have been all but exhausted .
in recent days , american strike aircraft have operated in what are known as " engagement zones " , where certain types of target are known to exist and where airborne controllers identify and direct the attacks .
it is a strategy which could continue almost indefinitely .
one of the aircraft used in such operations is the fearsome ac-130 , a gunship capable of devastating assaults on troop formations and concentrations of vehicles .
ground troops the second phase of the operation in afghanistan appears to have begun , with the announcement by us officials that more than 100 elite forces carried out a secretive ground assault in southern afghanistan in the early hours of saturday morning , local time .
they said the operation , backed by ac-130 flying gunships , lasted several hours but would give no other details .
earlier they confirmed that special forces are now operating inside afghanistan .
they appear to fall into two categories : a small team of soldiers , possibly accompanied by cia officers , working among pashtun tribesmen to whittle away at the taleban 's power base ; another offering help to the anti-taleban northern alliance in areas such as intelligence and reconnaissance .
aid and propaganda criticised as tokenism by some humanitarian organisations , america 's nightly air drops continue .
by friday , the official total was in excess of half a million packets -lrb- each packet containing rations for one adult for one day -rrb- .
washington has been getting its message across in two ways .
ec-130 " commando solo " psychological operations planes have been broadcasting a variety of messages , including support for the people of afghanistan and warnings not to interfere with ground troops , and to stay off roads and bridges .
" attention !
people of afghanistan .
united states forces will be moving through your area , " one broadcast message says .
" do not interfere with our troops or military operations .
if you do this , you will not be harmed . "
leaflets with similar messages are also being dropped .
the net result the taleban have taken a pounding , though little battle damage assessment has been released and observers on the ground point out that in this impoverished country , military hardware counts for less than basic loyalty .
in some areas , the original target lists have been all-but exhausted reports of taleban defections have been sporadic and largely unconfirmed .
but coalition bombing must have significantly disrupted the taleban 's ability to function .
pentagon officials say communications have been completely severed .
taleban commanders in one area may know little about events elsewhere in the country .
fighting blind , the taleban may find it hard to hold on much longer .
the way ahead raids such as the special operation on saturday morning could be a major element of the war from now on .
the aim would be to turn the tables on the taleban by using their own guerrilla tactics against them this new phase is what the british prime minister , tony blair , seemed to have been hinting at earlier this week when he warned that " the next few weeks will be the most testing time " .
but with political sensitivities high and winter approaching , a substantial land incursion is thought to be unlikely , although one senior british defence source said more visible ground operations could begin " within weeks " .
" sooner or later , the present government will fold or sue for peace , " he said , " and then we 'll have to move fast . "
" we definitely would n't leave a vacuum " , he added , noting that ground troops would only be part of a wider package of international intervention , including aid and financial assistance .
