the research , from audit scotland , also reveals service improvements for those patients who do keep their appointments are difficult because of a lack of centrally collected information .
robert black , scotland 's auditor general , has called for a comprehensive review of the whole system .
last year , 161,000 scots failed to turn up for appointments at outpatient clinics .
non-attendance is a widespread problem and each missed appointment is estimated to cost £ 63 , helping the total bill to over £ 10m annually .
outpatient clinics are often double-booked because staff know about 12 % of new patients will not turn up .
' few records ' however , the practice of double-booking can lead to long waits and overloaded doctors and nurses when patients do appear .
according to audit scotland , there can be other problems for those patients who do turn up .
it is not mandatory to record how outpatients are dealt with - and few trusts do , it said .
information on treatments being used and their outcome is patchy and not always reliable .
continuity of care may be crucial , but with no national data collected , there is no way to monitor how outpatients are treated across the country .
that lack of information , said audit scotland , is making it difficult to improve services , prompting mr black to call for a shake-up of the system .

president chirac was speaking after a meeting at the united nations headquarters with un secretary-general kofi annan .
today it is new york that was tragically struck but tomorrow it may be paris , berlin , london president jacques chirac mr chirac said the fight against terrorism would be a modern and unknown form of war - but it had to be made an international priority .
president chirac flew into new york from washington , where he had become the first foreign head of state to meet president bush since the attacks on the united states last week .
in new york , he flew over the area now known as ground zero , where rescue workers are clearing up the wreckage and recovering bodies from what remains of the world trade center .
the attack on the world trade center was beyond what we would call a crime , he said - it was the height of human foolishness .
then , mr chirac moved on to the un , which may yet become the focus of efforts to build a national coalition for a war on global terrorism .
after a working lunch with mr annan , he spelt out the french position .
fanatical groups " france , i can tell you , will not stand aside in a fight against a scourge that defies all democracies , " he said .
" today it is new york that was tragically struck but tomorrow it may be paris , berlin , london . "
" so of course france will determine the ways and means which it will contribute after making an evaluation and after reaching agreement with the other europeans and the americans and all its other partners . "
president chirac and mr annan spoke of the need to focus on the perpetrators of the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
mr chirac described them as fanatical groups , and both men said that any coalition set up to deal with the problem of terrorism would have to be as broadly based as possible if it was to be effective .

the new situation created by the september 11 terrorist attacks in the us makes it difficult to formulate immediately a precise delivery forecast for 2002 and beyond airbus eads is the majority shareholder of aeroplane manufacturer airbus .
its us rival boeing said on wednesday that it would cut production sharply and sack up to 30,000 workers .
the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- made the announcement as it reported a 38 % rise in core profits for the first half of the year due to strong deliveries and the consolidation of airbus into a company .
despite the poor industry outlook , eads said its plans for the a380 super jumbo were on track .
eads was formed from the merger of three aircraft and defence companies in france , spain and germany , and makes almost all its profits from its 80 % stake in commercial aircraft maker airbus .
the world 's second largest commercial plane maker also stuck by its target of a 10 % operating profit in 2004 , despite the negative outlook for the airline sector following last week 's terrorist attacks in the united states .
expansion frozen among the measures being taken are a freeze in some investment and capacity expansion , the company said , without giving further details .
" we believe our strong business fundamentals and an array of new products and services both on civil and defence markets , as well as initiatives and actions we have already started allows us to maintain our 2004 operating margin target of 10 % despite a highly uncertain market , " eads said in a statement .
but with the us airline industry in trouble , and some carriers even facing bankruptcy , analysts are predicting airlines will defer retiring older aircraft , cancel order options and put off deliveries for 2003 and 2004 .
some airlines have also reportedly started renegotiating the cost of their orders .
forecasts difficult eads said airbus was still planning to deliver 320 aircraft this year , but that " the new situation created by the september 11 terrorist attacks in the us makes it difficult to formulate immediately a precise delivery forecast for 2002 and beyond . "
earnings before interest and tax at eads were 764m euro , up from 553m euro last year , slightly below analysts expectations .
airbus 's order intake in the half year totalled 38.7bn euro , compared with a proforma 15.5bn a year earlier .

dr williams , who witnessed the " unspeakably wicked " destruction of the world trade center , will give a keynote speech at the church in wales governing body meeting at lampeter on thursday .
having observed the destructive force of the terrorists in new york , which left him " extremely shocked " , dr williams said great thought and effort should be applied to countering international terrorism .
he warned that any act of punishment for the attacks must not take the shape of revenge .
five thousand people - including up to 300 britons - are thought to have died in new york and washington .
in his address , the archbishop will say : " no ' star wars ' shield of missile defence could have averted last tuesday 's atrocities .
" no intensive campaign to search and destroy in afghanistan will guarantee that it will never happen again .
" if we fear and loathe terrorism , we have to think harder .
" when those who have power respond with enormous threats and high rhetoric of relentless pursuit , they too are dealing with the anger of helplessness .
indiscriminate terror is the weapon of the weak , not the strong dr rowan williams , archbishop of wales " last tuesday 's events were terrible for the usa - the us government had to struggle to overcome the sense of impotence in the nation .
" indiscriminate terror is the weapon of the weak , not the strong ; it 's commonly what the ' strong ' are n't expecting , which is why they are vulnerable to it .
" it is the weapon of those who have nothing to lose .
" if we want it not to happen , we have to be asking what it means that the world has so many people in it who believe they have nothing to lose .
his speech continues : " today it is right and proper that we seek for justice .
" even in the extremity of anger and misery , people are always answerable for the choices they make , and the decision to kill several thousand innocent people was a real decision , an unspeakably wicked and deluded decision . "
archbishop rowan will add : " so the challenge before the usa and its allies today , is to ask what is to be done beyond punishment to make any such punishment more than revenge .
dr williams will tell delegates in lampeter that faith meant dealing with the fear of death .
" last tuesday , i was privileged to know for a couple of hours what it might be to face death in company , and was blessed with a group of people around me with whom i can say without exaggeration i was glad to be in such a moment .
the archbishop concludes : " we have to prove that risk and reconciliation are indeed ' a new and living way ' and to plead with the powerful to consider where true security lies , lest the trap of violence close still more finally on us .
" it is a hard moment ; perhaps we can understand afresh why we pray not to be brought to the time of trial and to be delivered from evil . "

the chicago-based american italian defense association -lrb- aida -rrb- had brought the action because it said that the show , about italian-american gangsters in the us , insulted the dignity of the community .
but cook county judge richard siebel ruled that the association had no basis on which to sue the programme , as it had suffered no injury .
he also ruled that the hbo-made show had a constitutional right to air its depiction of a fictional new jersey family of mafia members .
in a reference to the plaintiff 's acronym aida , the judge wrote in his 11-page ruling : " the aria may be offensive to verdi , but the sopranos have the constitutional right to sing . "
financial damages lawyers for time warner entertainment , which owns the tv channel hbo , had been arguing for a dismissal of the case .
the company said that if the show were condemned in court they would be open to suits seeking financial damages .
time warner lawyers also argued that an adverse decision could lead to the censorship of other fictional works .
lawyers for aida said they had not sought damages from time warner entertainment but wanted a declaration from the judge that the popular show violated a " dignity clause " in the illinois constitution .
the clause is designed to protect individuals from communications that incite hostility based on their religion , race or other affiliation .
the series has 22 nominations for this year 's emmys - postponed because of the us attacks last week - and will hope to add to the solitary emmy it won last year .

british airways has joined virgin in cutting thousands of workers in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the united states and mounting operating costs .
ba said the " exceptional conditions " of last week 's attacks meant 5,200 extra jobs on top of 1,800 previously announced .
the bae airbus plant at broughton , flintshire - recently buoyed after winning the contract to build wings for the a380 " superjumbo " - could be affected by the sudden shrinking of the air industry .
the sector accounts for over 13,000 jobs in wales .
bae won the wing assembly contract for the a380 the american-owned ge air engine maintenance plant at nantgarw , near cardiff , has quashed speculation surrounding some of the 300 jobs there .
a spokesperson said the workers are safe for the time being , but was uncertain of long-term prospects and are preparing to update staff on the situation .
air maintenance plants at llantrisant and rhoose in south wales could also be affected .
airbus 's flintshire plant is reliant on a healthy order book .
but german airline lufthansa announced on wednesday it is cancelling an order for up to 15 a380s .
the news followed boeing 's decision to cut 30,000 jobs .
airbus said on wednesday that it was " too early to say " if the decision would have an impact on the european consortium 's plans .
the a380 deal announced last year safeguarded 1,500 jobs jobs at broughton and was set to create a further 1,500 , which was welcomed by the welsh assembly .
drop in demand airbus said it had no immediate plans to change production patterns , with the consortium less dependent on the us for plane orders than boeing .
the consortium said it was " cautiously optimistic " about the medium to long-term view .
british airways has announced it is cutting 5,000 jobs and axing certain routes .
the company has already lost £ 300m this year and is expecting a large drop in demand for its profitable transatlantic routes , following last tuesday 's terrorist strikes .
ba employs around 1,000 in wales and uses the cardiff airport to carry out maintenance on those long-range boeing 747 and 777 craft .
the company was unable to clarify whether any of those positions would be affected , and unions are braced for redundancies .
the introduction of new safety rules and a collapse in public confidence have combined to push airlines to bring in swift cost-saving measures . watch / listen programme pages see also : 15 may 00 -pipe- wales bae 's optimism over jobs grant 30 nov 00 -pipe- wales superjumbo orders take-off 29 jun 00 -pipe- wales superjumbo aid pressure grows 19 sep 01 -pipe- wales muslim leaders probe reported attacks 12 sep 01 -pipe- wales passengers stranded in air alert internet links : uk government online bae systems airbus british airways british airline pilots ' associatio the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : soap actor killed in holiday fall wales leads uk bust firms league husband jailed for rape attack festival town prepares for euros plea for more kidney donors rowing team arrives back in uk families opt for single jabs hain turns fire on greens links to more wales stories are at the foot of the page .

british airways has joined virgin in cutting thousands of workers in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the united states and mounting operating costs .
ba said the " exceptional conditions " of last week 's attacks meant 5,200 extra jobs on top of 1,800 previously announced .
the bae airbus plant at broughton , flintshire - recently buoyed after winning the contract to build wings for the a380 " superjumbo " - could be affected by the sudden shrinking of the air industry .
the sector accounts for over 13,000 jobs in wales .
the american-owned ge air engine maintenance plant at nantgarw , near cardiff , has quashed speculation surrounding some of the 300 jobs there .
a spokesperson said the workers are safe for the time being , but was uncertain of long-term prospects and are preparing to update staff on the situation .
air maintenance plants at llantrisant and rhoose in south wales could also be affected .
airbus 's flintshire plant is reliant on a healthy order book .
but german airline lufthansa announced on wednesday it is cancelling an order for up to 15 a380s .
the news followed boeing 's decision to cut 30,000 jobs .
airbus said on wednesday that it was " too early to say " if the decision would have an impact on the european consortium 's plans .
the a380 deal announced last year safeguarded 1,500 jobs jobs at broughton and was set to create a further 1,500 , which was welcomed by the welsh assembly .
drop in demand airbus said it had no immediate plans to change production patterns , with the consortium less dependent on the us for plane orders than boeing .
the consortium said it was " cautiously optimistic " about the medium to long-term view .
british airways has announced it is cutting 5,000 jobs and axing certain routes .
the company has already lost £ 300m this year and is expecting a large drop in demand for its profitable transatlantic routes , following last tuesday 's terrorist strikes .
ba employs around 1,000 in wales and uses the cardiff airport to carry out maintenance on those long-range boeing 747 and 777 craft .
the company was unable to clarify whether any of those positions would be affected , and unions are braced for redundancies .
the introduction of new safety rules and a collapse in public confidence have combined to push airlines to bring in swift cost-saving measures .

the topics discussed this week were : proof required before taking action ?
extreme to declare war ?
war against terrorism exclusively for bin laden or extend to ira ?
introduce an identity card ?
how soon libdems main opposition party ?
new labour cronies in important bbc jobs ?
general comments on the programme proof required before taking action ?
audience question : what burden of proof is required before taking action against the individuals , groups or countries deemed guilty of perpetrating the atrocity in the usa ?
you said : how can the us expect the taleban to blindly handover a ' guest ' without providing proper evidence ?
would they hand over an american citizen ' suspected ' of collaborating with the ira to the uk without any documented proof , even though the uk is one of america 's strongest allies ?
no they would n't , and neither would they tolerate the uk giving such extreme deadlines and warnings .
why should bin laden 's case be any different ?
abdulla , london i think it is quite right that we as a coalition do go after bin laden but the evidence against him should be made public .
i hope bush junior does not repeat the mistake his father made in dealing with saddam who i feel should have been taken out of the frame .
stuart , london my opinion is that for generations , the united states and britain , as its echo , has gone round the world with nato systematically scorching from this earth governments that we do n't like - peppering nations and real people with our cruise missiles and coldly referring to the dead as " collateral damage " .
we are subconsciously racist , and make no mistake , had it have been thousands of iraqis or iranians or afghans killed like this , it would have barely been reported in our western media .
james burns , glasgow when quizzed that osama bin laden was not proven to be guilty of the recent crimes , one of the panel on tonight 's show said that one could not apply the same courtroom principles of proof beyond reasonable doubt to the current issue of osama bin laden 's involvement in the matter .
to me that statement means that american foreign policy is founded on the principle that judgement should be passed on a whim and on suspicion and has no dependency on proof whatsoever .
annis kotia , leeds the usa must provide ample evidence to support their claims .
without this proof the civilians of allied nations will remain hesitant and wary of any military strike on any islamic nation .
we must not allow feelings of rage to govern our common sense !
we must constantly question why such attacks were made on the usa - yes we feel for those who lost their lives in the us .
yet it is the role the usa plays in foreign policies that explain these atrocious acts of terrorism !
resolution without deaths of civilians must remain our priority !
anjuman kang , london my worry is that it is very difficult to capture the terrorists but the terrorists have unlimited numbers of targets to make their point .
how long before the terrorists get hold of a biological or nuclear bomb and make an example of one western city ?
both the uk and us governments should be careful in starting a full war on an enemy they ca n't see .
dialogue is the only way forward coupled with increased intelligence .
charles chani , london the fact the usa has not revealed its evidence to most of its allies in nato except for the british defence minister who ' believes that he has seen fairly convincing evidence ' is a pretty fair representation of how the usa treats other people in this world .
the whole world is not supposed to have their own judgement or make up their own minds because they should just trust usa evidence or , more truly , instincts .
soha elsheikh osama bin laden needs to be offered the chance to put forward his point of view , and his reasons for talking about jihad against america , before talking about war .
as he is known as a true muslim then let 's test it , before we declare war .
the taleban also mention that if we provide evidence that he is responsible for the wtc incident than he will be punished for that .
fahad , london is it not high time for the usa to provide creditable evidence against osama to save its face as a super power in the world 's eyes .
raza , uae how sure can we be that the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon were not carried out by american dissidents , given the fact that the united states has never liked facing up to conspiracies from within ?
was america wise to execute mcveigh , thereby silencing forever the one man who could have provided information about his co-conspirators , and simultaneously creating a martyr ?
stephen frost , colwyn bay , n wales return to the top of the page extreme to declare war ?
audience question : do the panel not think it is extreme to declare war on a country for holding one terrorist suspected of organising the new york attack ?
you said : as a scottish expat living in the us i am very disappointed to read some of the comments concerning military action against the taleban .
i do agree that the " war " against terrorism should not exclude non-islamic extremist groups .
however at this moment i do believe that action against the taleban and osama bin laden is justifiable .
stewart corscadden , brunswick , maine , usa to kill innocent people is wrong , whether they are killed in the wtc or on the plains of afghanistan or by sanctions .
america should learn that it is only going to create another generation of extremists by punishing civilians for the acts of a military elite .
but then they do not care , because not to act would lose votes .
who are the people hiding in the shadows i wonder ?
ben patient , london the taleban want to try osama bin laden in an islamic / sharia court .
the killing of an innocent person in islamic law is punishable by death .
if america has clear proof against him as they claim , then why not evade very expensive and life costing military action by using such an alternative ?
kasim mirza , islamabad , pakistan the usa deplores the fact that thousands of innocent people have lost their lives .
how then , can the proposed attacks on afghanistan justify the further killing of countless thousands of innocent people for the sake of the capture of one man !
miss s hafeez , birmingham america has always proclaimed to be one of the leading democratic countries in the world .
president bush said : ' if you are not with us , you are against us ' leaving very little choice for countries such as pakistan and many other muslim countries who would have liked to remain completely neutral due to the great internal instability military action would provoke in these countries .
azhar khan , london should any nation deem it acceptable to harbour a mass murderer ?
answer this , and the rest will follow .
afghanistan have been given a choice : ' hand him -lsb- bin laden -rsb- over , or we will take him by force . '
the holy men , and bin laden himself , have been given the chance to save innocent lives .
by not handing him -lsb- bin laden -rsb- over they choose war .
we must not forget that america has suffered the initial attack - what follows is merely retaliation , and prevention for the future .
holly , lincolnshire we believe the us should remove the taleban dictatorship through intelligence , and more importantly win afghanistan support by aggressively feeding the starving millions .
ca n't be as expensive as dropping a few million dollars worth of artillery .
it 's important to be the good guys .
barney hall , southend-on-sea i am sick and tired of hearing people say : " the americans deserved it " .
let 's not forget it was the americans who were attacked .
whoever did this terrible thing has declared war on america and its allies - they need to be punished .
it is not the americans that are to blame if innocent people are killed in afghanistan .
the afghan government has been asked time and time again to release who they think is the prime suspect , and they still decline .
john stanworth , burnley if after afghanistan has been bombed the world feels that mr bin laden was not directly responsible , then will the propagator of a crusade / war against civilians be arrested and tried in the hague ?
nonetheless , every muslim on the planet is extremely sad about the innocent civilians killed in new york .
ali , glasgow this war against terrorism will have a lot more casualties - a lot more innocent casualties .
how can this be justified ?
do two wrongs make a right ?
can america avoid turning into terrorists ?
iain hepburn , stirling , scotland what the us fails to see is why these people felt it necessary to bomb the wtc .
this ' campaign ' against afghanistan is going to lead to more terrorist acts .
the innocent in the us have paid with their lives , now a group already starving and destitute will pay .
how is bombing the hell out of one of the poorest countries in the world going to solve the problem of ' global terrorism ' ?
sayed , leicester i believe that any military action against afghanistan and also the bringing of bin laden to justice will be a short term solution to the problem of terrorism .
the scary aspect of all of this is that the perpetrators of the attack were from different countries and are also highly educated people and this means that bin laden has followers all over the muslim world ... and therefore there is a bigger threat than anyone can imagine .
shabrina , kent would the offer of aid to afghanistan , in the form of more hospitals and better public amenities , be a more constructive and positive way of asking for their co-operation in attaining information on the whereabouts of bin laden ?
the overall loss of human life and economic cost would be greatly reduced and confidence in our country 's beliefs restored in these countries .
tracey , croydon if there is a military bombardment of afghanistan , innocent people will die .
what is there to stop a child now , whose family is killed , from undertaking terrorist action against the usa in 20 years time ?
wez , telford what geoff hoon has said about the american language , such as " dead or alive " is very naive and quite distressing .
ben , sutton if dying as a martyr for islam is such an honour then why is bin laden prepared to let millions die to save his skin - and if he is so innocent then why is he hiding with an " army " in the mountains ?
caroline jones , birmingham does george bush not see that there was no way that the taleban would meet the demands set ?
big talk , but this has all got an inevitable conclusion - a war against relatively innocent people .
adam gristwood , stevenage return to the top of the page war against terrorism exclusively for bin laden or extend to ira ?
audience question : if we are to stand shoulder to shoulder with the us in this war against terrorism is this position reserved exclusively for osama bin laden or will it extend to the ira ?
you said : tony blair has promised america britain 's full support .
many ira terrorists and their well wishers are known throughout britain and the rest of the world .
would george bush be willing to offer his full support including military action to britain against terrorism in britain .
for some reason i have a hunch that it 's a one-sided love story .
alex hussain , liverpool for years the united states has done nothing to prevent us citizens from financing terrorist organisations in northern ireland .
an interview on bbc radio 4 's today programme -lrb- september 19 -rrb- confirmed that the practice continues under the protection of us law .
why do we not demand of the us what the us rightly demands of the rest of the world - namely an end to all means of support for terrorists ?
or does terrorism only matter when it occurs on us soil ?
jeremy fox , london why is there no recognition of the fact that terrorism does not happen in a vacuum - it is a result of disenfranchisement , nationally and internationally .
civil rights and mutual respect for race and creed are the issue , in both of which the west have been negligent , at home and abroad , especially in n ireland .
m mccrystal , london why is it that the ira , eta and all other terrorists are excluded from this war on terrorism ?
i fully support the fact that whoever is behind this should be made to answer for their crimes .
but this should be done in the best possible way and carried out in the same way we would have treated terrorists in our own backyard .
i do n't see us in the uk going to northern ireland and bombing the whole place .
i am sure we would not want to see a backlash if this is not done properly .
my sympathy to all those who have lost friends , family and relatives .
lattif ahzan , southampton now that america and its allies are to wage a war against terrorism can we expect the american forces invading northern ireland to rid us of the ira and such factions ?
i seem to recall from past documentaries that certain new yorkers were very happy to give money to the ira fund-raising activities to further their cause .
can one now assume that those new yorkers who were sympathetic to the ira will be having second thoughts !
peter wilson , london will the us be air-dropping special forces into northern ireland , germany and spain to deal with terrorism in those countries ?
kenneth devine , leuchars do you think , had the usa not been the target of the terrorist attack on the wtc , we would have seen the great effort being made now to stamp out terrorism ?
paul irving , middlesbrough i do n't think the us should send in armed ground forces or even bombs - a covert action team like the sas could go in and do it with minimum fuss .
if the un and rest of the world are going against terrorism what about the kashmiri militants who are supported by the pakistanis ?
the ira is supported by american irish people .
dilip mistry , loughborough return to the top of the page introduce an identity card ?
audience question : is it time to put security before civil liberties and introduce an identity card ?
you said : it is not an infringement on civil liberty to prove you are who say you are .
it should be an honour to prove yourself .
if everyone has an id card -lrb- as in some european countries -rrb- then many issues can be resolved easily ; for example , proof of age , proof of identity etc .
it is only those who have something to hide who have objections to such a scheme .
liam , farnborough i understand the opposition to these but what about compulsory dna testing for everyone in the country to be used when solving crimes ?
with modern forensics we regularly get dna evidence and there have been cases of dna tests for all in a crime-ridden area .
if we had this info on record , solving crimes like murder and possibly terrorism would be easier .
dan , leeds what good will identity cards do ?
we have known about a number of terrorists living in our midst for years , but have chosen not to do anything about it .
why ?
surely we -lrb- in britain -rrb- are no better than all the other countries who harbour terrorists and other criminals .
carole , woking , surrey as geoff hoon correctly pointed out introducing id cards could be dangerous in that it could offer " false legitimacy " to terrorists .
if these terrorists can plan and execute the simultaneous hijacking of four aircraft , what is the likelihood that they will not be able to falsify an id card ?
tommy miller , oxford a slippery slope towards a cashless society .
i will never carry an id card .
why should i be presumed guilty ?
id cards will do nothing to stop anything .
you can still drive a car without a licence and kill someone .
colin fighting undemocratic acts with undemocratic actions -lrb- introducing id cards -rrb- allows the terrorists to win .
some people 's reactions to the events have been sickening .
we should and must treasure our liberty or the years of struggle will have been for nothing .
jonathan seyghal , london return to the top of the page how soon libdems main opposition party ?
audience question : now that the tories have elected iain duncan smith as their leader how soon will the liberal democrats become the main party of opposition ?
you said : i thought the panel debated the issues quite well and as a member of the labour party i was in fact quite impressed with david davis .
i thought he handled some of the criticism towards his party very well !
mark vincent i really hope that the libdems do become the party of opposition .
perhaps then we can start having grown up politics in this country , instead of parties taking the opposite view just to look different in the press .
i , like many others , have an interest in politics but not in party politics .
stewart , kidderminster from voting figures it seems that the liberal democrats only gained their seats from tactical voting in order to keep the conservatives -lrb- then under hague -rrb- out of office .
despite this voting , the conservatives still have three times the number of seats and just under twice the number of votes than the liberal democrats .
nick hoggard the question was treated as a joke - does anyone treat this question seriously ?
andrew , edinburgh given the opportunity , the labour and liberal democrat party faithful would have voted for iain duncan smith also .
his win has certainly boosted their chances of electoral success at the next election .
mike pilkington , newton abbot , devon return to the top of the page new labour cronies in important bbc jobs ?
audience question : is it right that the two most important people in the bbc are both new labour cronies ?
you said : these appointments can only be damaging , for the nation as a whole , and for greg dyke and gavyn davies , the two men appointed .
the men will lose their credibility due to their positions and their strong publicly known party ties .
the bbc is supposed to be an unbiased national institution , which reports fairly on news items regarding all political parties .
paddy denny while much importance has been attached to the political persuasions of the new directors at the bbc , little has been attached to other factors such as race , sex or origin within the country .
is it fair , for example , to have two men in these positions ?
evidently so .
perhaps it would be wise to remember the difference between our broadcasting standards of free speech and fairness compared to a country such as afghanistan , where there is total state domination of news reports and programme content .
rob streeter , cranbrook common sense should have prevailed .
after the hue and cry following the previous bbc appointment , a bit more thought would have prevented this new appointment being such a major issue and allowed the politicians to get on with the job at hand rather than having this futile debate .
seph o 'connell , barnsley why not also get concerned about making sure one is a man and one is a woman , one is black one is white , one is from the north and one is from the south , one is . you get the picture .
pick the best individuals for the job .
steve rollin , nottingham return to the top of the page general comments on the programme : christine coleman seems to think that between 64 and 80 % of the uk population are against military action .
i think she misread the opinion polls - it was 64 to 80 % in favour !
andrew whiting , bookham congratulations question time .
after the outrage caused by your previous ' insensitive ' and ' unrepresentative ' edition , this week 's programme redeemed you .
bearing in mind , 78 % of people quite rightly support britain 's alliance with the us , and the possibility of military force , i thought your audience was representative , and totally undiluted .
well done !
holly , lincolnshire ishtiaq ahmed is not representative of all muslims .
could n't you find someone more eloquent with a real grasp of the key issues discussed ?
mo , york for shame , yesterday 's edition of the programme was so watered down and so desperate to please the critics of last week 's show that it was yet another nail in the coffin of free speech - another example of the bbc drowning out voices to please the us .
stand up for yourself and be counted as an unbiased organisation which will not bow down to political pressures .
mohammed adil i wish to complain about the question time of 20 sept .
in a time of impending war the issues were not addressed and both the panel and audience were unrepresentative and complacent .
last week 's programme converted my teenage children to political debate - it provoked some excellent democratic discussion .
this week 's was a disgrace .
andrew bird it seems there is a problem with your selection of the " live " audience in so much as they seem unrepresentative of the general opinion in the country .
any support of the us was met with fake laughter etc and mr dimbleby , although apparently a respected figure , seems to be unaware of what is going on .
eric ingham after last week 's fiasco i watched last night hoping one of my favourite bbc programmes had n't totally gone off the rails .
i was pleasantly surprised .
the programme was balanced and informative .
the gentleman from bradford was superb .
he had similar views to those that caused so much trouble last week but he got them across with humility and empathy .
he should be commended .
he is a credit to his community and with more leaders like him on tv bridges will be built between all sides in the uk and understandings will be reached .
finally a panel which did n't contain a majority of left-wingers as well .
will wonders never cease ?
well done to all concerned .
paddy cronin , sunderland oh dear , question time .
so this is the real cross-section of the public ?
considering that at least 64 % and up to 80 % of the british people are against military action - i do n't think so .
could it be that we are over-compensating for the previous edition ?
how very dull .

president bush said : ' if you are not with us , you are against us ' leaving very little choice for countries such as pakistan and many other muslim countries who would have liked to remain completely neutral due to the great internal instability military action would provoke in these countries .
azhar khan , london should any nation deem it acceptable to harbour a mass murderer ?
answer this , and the rest will follow .
afghanistan have been given a choice : ' hand him -lsb- bin laden -rsb- over , or we will take him by force . '
the holy men , and bin laden himself , have been given the chance to save innocent lives .
by not handing him -lsb- bin laden -rsb- over they choose war .
we must not forget that america has suffered the initial attack - what follows is merely retaliation , and prevention for the future .
holly , lincolnshire we believe the us should remove the taleban dictatorship through intelligence , and more importantly win afghanistan support by aggressively feeding the starving millions .
ca n't be as expensive as dropping a few million dollars worth of artillery .
it 's important to be the good guys .
barney hall , southend-on-sea i am sick and tired of hearing people say : " the americans deserved it " .
let 's not forget it was the americans who were attacked .
whoever did this terrible thing has declared war on america and its allies - they need to be punished .
it is not the americans that are to blame if innocent people are killed in afghanistan .
the afghan government has been asked time and time again to release who they think is the prime suspect , and they still decline .
john stanworth , burnley if after afghanistan has been bombed the world feels that mr bin laden was not directly responsible , then will the propagator of a crusade / war against civilians be arrested and tried in the hague ?
nonetheless , every muslim on the planet is extremely sad about the innocent civilians killed in new york .
ali , glasgow this war against terrorism will have a lot more casualties - a lot more innocent casualties .
how can this be justified ?
do two wrongs make a right ?
can america avoid turning into terrorists ?
iain hepburn , stirling , scotland what the us fails to see is why these people felt it necessary to bomb the wtc .
this ' campaign ' against afghanistan is going to lead to more terrorist acts .
the innocent in the us have paid with their lives , now a group already starving and destitute will pay .
how is bombing the hell out of one of the poorest countries in the world going to solve the problem of ' global terrorism ' ?
sayed , leicester i believe that any military action against afghanistan and also the bringing of bin laden to justice will be a short term solution to the problem of terrorism .
the scary aspect of all of this is that the perpetrators of the attack were from different countries and are also highly educated people and this means that bin laden has followers all over the muslim world ... and therefore there is a bigger threat than anyone can imagine .
shabrina , kent would the offer of aid to afghanistan , in the form of more hospitals and better public amenities , be a more constructive and positive way of asking for their co-operation in attaining information on the whereabouts of bin laden ?
the overall loss of human life and economic cost would be greatly reduced and confidence in our country 's beliefs restored in these countries .
tracey , croydon if there is a military bombardment of afghanistan , innocent people will die .
what is there to stop a child now , whose family is killed , from undertaking terrorist action against the usa in 20 years time ?
wez , telford what geoff hoon has said about the american language , such as " dead or alive " is very naive and quite distressing .
ben , sutton if dying as a martyr for islam is such an honour then why is bin laden prepared to let millions die to save his skin - and if he is so innocent then why is he hiding with an " army " in the mountains ?
caroline jones , birmingham does george bush not see that there was no way that the taleban would meet the demands set ?
big talk , but this has all got an inevitable conclusion - a war against relatively innocent people .
adam gristwood , stevenage return to the top of the page war against terrorism exclusively for bin laden or extend to ira ?
audience question : if we are to stand shoulder to shoulder with the us in this war against terrorism is this position reserved exclusively for osama bin laden or will it extend to the ira ?
you said : tony blair has promised america britain 's full support .
many ira terrorists and their well wishers are known throughout britain and the rest of the world .
would george bush be willing to offer his full support including military action to britain against terrorism in britain .
for some reason i have a hunch that it 's a one-sided love story .
alex hussain , liverpool for years the united states has done nothing to prevent us citizens from financing terrorist organisations in northern ireland .
an interview on bbc radio 4 's today programme -lrb- september 19 -rrb- confirmed that the practice continues under the protection of us law .
why do we not demand of the us what the us rightly demands of the rest of the world - namely an end to all means of support for terrorists ?
or does terrorism only matter when it occurs on us soil ?
jeremy fox , london why is there no recognition of the fact that terrorism does not happen in a vacuum - it is a result of disenfranchisement , nationally and internationally .
civil rights and mutual respect for race and creed are the issue , in both of which the west have been negligent , at home and abroad , especially in n ireland .
m mccrystal , london why is it that the ira , eta and all other terrorists are excluded from this war on terrorism ?
i fully support the fact that whoever is behind this should be made to answer for their crimes .
but this should be done in the best possible way and carried out in the same way we would have treated terrorists in our own backyard .
i do n't see us in the uk going to northern ireland and bombing the whole place .
i am sure we would not want to see a backlash if this is not done properly .
my sympathy to all those who have lost friends , family and relatives .
lattif ahzan , southampton now that america and its allies are to wage a war against terrorism can we expect the american forces invading northern ireland to rid us of the ira and such factions ?
i seem to recall from past documentaries that certain new yorkers were very happy to give money to the ira fund-raising activities to further their cause .
can one now assume that those new yorkers who were sympathetic to the ira will be having second thoughts !
peter wilson , london will the us be air-dropping special forces into northern ireland , germany and spain to deal with terrorism in those countries ?
kenneth devine , leuchars do you think , had the usa not been the target of the terrorist attack on the wtc , we would have seen the great effort being made now to stamp out terrorism ?
paul irving , middlesbrough i do n't think the us should send in armed ground forces or even bombs - a covert action team like the sas could go in and do it with minimum fuss .
if the un and rest of the world are going against terrorism what about the kashmiri militants who are supported by the pakistanis ?
the ira is supported by american irish people .
dilip mistry , loughborough return to the top of the page introduce an identity card ?
audience question : is it time to put security before civil liberties and introduce an identity card ?
you said : it is not an infringement on civil liberty to prove you are who say you are .
it should be an honour to prove yourself .
if everyone has an id card -lrb- as in some european countries -rrb- then many issues can be resolved easily ; for example , proof of age , proof of identity etc .
it is only those who have something to hide who have objections to such a scheme .
liam , farnborough i understand the opposition to these but what about compulsory dna testing for everyone in the country to be used when solving crimes ?
with modern forensics we regularly get dna evidence and there have been cases of dna tests for all in a crime-ridden area .
if we had this info on record , solving crimes like murder and possibly terrorism would be easier .
dan , leeds what good will identity cards do ?
we have known about a number of terrorists living in our midst for years , but have chosen not to do anything about it .
why ?
surely we -lrb- in britain -rrb- are no better than all the other countries who harbour terrorists and other criminals .
carole , woking , surrey as geoff hoon correctly pointed out introducing id cards could be dangerous in that it could offer " false legitimacy " to terrorists .
if these terrorists can plan and execute the simultaneous hijacking of four aircraft , what is the likelihood that they will not be able to falsify an id card ?
tommy miller , oxford a slippery slope towards a cashless society .
i will never carry an id card .
why should i be presumed guilty ?
id cards will do nothing to stop anything .
you can still drive a car without a licence and kill someone .
colin fighting undemocratic acts with undemocratic actions -lrb- introducing id cards -rrb- allows the terrorists to win .
some people 's reactions to the events have been sickening .
we should and must treasure our liberty or the years of struggle will have been for nothing .
jonathan seyghal , london return to the top of the page how soon libdems main opposition party ?
audience question : now that the tories have elected iain duncan smith as their leader how soon will the liberal democrats become the main party of opposition ?
you said : i thought the panel debated the issues quite well and as a member of the labour party i was in fact quite impressed with david davis .
i thought he handled some of the criticism towards his party very well !
mark vincent i really hope that the libdems do become the party of opposition .
perhaps then we can start having grown up politics in this country , instead of parties taking the opposite view just to look different in the press .
i , like many others , have an interest in politics but not in party politics .
stewart , kidderminster from voting figures it seems that the liberal democrats only gained their seats from tactical voting in order to keep the conservatives -lrb- then under hague -rrb- out of office .
despite this voting , the conservatives still have three times the number of seats and just under twice the number of votes than the liberal democrats .
nick hoggard the question was treated as a joke - does anyone treat this question seriously ?
andrew , edinburgh given the opportunity , the labour and liberal democrat party faithful would have voted for iain duncan smith also .
his win has certainly boosted their chances of electoral success at the next election .
mike pilkington , newton abbot , devon return to the top of the page new labour cronies in important bbc jobs ?
audience question : is it right that the two most important people in the bbc are both new labour cronies ?
you said : these appointments can only be damaging , for the nation as a whole , and for greg dyke and gavyn davies , the two men appointed .
the men will lose their credibility due to their positions and their strong publicly known party ties .
the bbc is supposed to be an unbiased national institution , which reports fairly on news items regarding all political parties .
paddy denny while much importance has been attached to the political persuasions of the new directors at the bbc , little has been attached to other factors such as race , sex or origin within the country .
is it fair , for example , to have two men in these positions ?
evidently so .
perhaps it would be wise to remember the difference between our broadcasting standards of free speech and fairness compared to a country such as afghanistan , where there is total state domination of news reports and programme content .
rob streeter , cranbrook common sense should have prevailed .
after the hue and cry following the previous bbc appointment , a bit more thought would have prevented this new appointment being such a major issue and allowed the politicians to get on with the job at hand rather than having this futile debate .
seph o 'connell , barnsley why not also get concerned about making sure one is a man and one is a woman , one is black one is white , one is from the north and one is from the south , one is . you get the picture .
pick the best individuals for the job .
steve rollin , nottingham return to the top of the page general comments on the programme : christine coleman seems to think that between 64 and 80 % of the uk population are against military action .
i think she misread the opinion polls - it was 64 to 80 % in favour !
andrew whiting , bookham congratulations question time .
after the outrage caused by your previous ' insensitive ' and ' unrepresentative ' edition , this week 's programme redeemed you .
bearing in mind , 78 % of people quite rightly support britain 's alliance with the us , and the possibility of military force , i thought your audience was representative , and totally undiluted .
well done !
holly , lincolnshire ishtiaq ahmed is not representative of all muslims .
could n't you find someone more eloquent with a real grasp of the key issues discussed ?
mo , york for shame , yesterday 's edition of the programme was so watered down and so desperate to please the critics of last week 's show that it was yet another nail in the coffin of free speech - another example of the bbc drowning out voices to please the us .
stand up for yourself and be counted as an unbiased organisation which will not bow down to political pressures .
mohammed adil i wish to complain about the question time of 20 sept .
in a time of impending war the issues were not addressed and both the panel and audience were unrepresentative and complacent .
last week 's programme converted my teenage children to political debate - it provoked some excellent democratic discussion .
this week 's was a disgrace .
andrew bird it seems there is a problem with your selection of the " live " audience in so much as they seem unrepresentative of the general opinion in the country .
any support of the us was met with fake laughter etc and mr dimbleby , although apparently a respected figure , seems to be unaware of what is going on .
eric ingham after last week 's fiasco i watched last night hoping one of my favourite bbc programmes had n't totally gone off the rails .
i was pleasantly surprised .
the programme was balanced and informative .
the gentleman from bradford was superb .
he had similar views to those that caused so much trouble last week but he got them across with humility and empathy .
he should be commended .
he is a credit to his community and with more leaders like him on tv bridges will be built between all sides in the uk and understandings will be reached .
finally a panel which did n't contain a majority of left-wingers as well .
will wonders never cease ?
well done to all concerned .
paddy cronin , sunderland oh dear , question time .
so this is the real cross-section of the public ?
considering that at least 64 % and up to 80 % of the british people are against military action - i do n't think so .
could it be that we are over-compensating for the previous edition ?
how very dull .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : the outlook for europe 's airlines categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 20 september , 2001 , 08:42 gmt 09:42 uk q & a : the outlook for europe 's airlines european airlines fear for the worst as panic after the attacks on the us compounds the effects of an economic slowdown .
bbc news online explains why they are desperate for financial aid , just like their us rivals .
how bad is the financial outlook for european airlines ?
although us airlines have been hit harder by the attacks of last week , the european airlines also face falling passenger numbers , added security costs , falls in their share prices and increased insurance premiums .
any airline that suffered financial losses before the attacks , such as british airways and swissair , is particularly vulnerable .
both virgin atlantic and british airways have announced thousands of staff cuts in the last few days .
iata , the international air transport association , estimates that airlines worldwide will suffer total losses of £ 10bn in 2001 .
why was the airline industry suffering before the attacks ?
the economic slowdown has left airlines suffering from excess capacity as passenger numbers , especially lucrative business travellers , drop .
in particular , the us downturn has affected major airlines , such as british airways , which generate a lot of their business from the transatlantic route .
iata 's spokesman william gaillard also points out that airlines were forced to negotiate expensive contracts with pilots just as the economic slowdown took a grip .
meanwhile , recent highs in the oil price have dented sentiment in the sector as airlines spend more than 10 % of their operating costs on fuel .
in addition , airlines are facing increased tariffs charged by airports and air traffic control .
how has this been exacerbated by the attacks on the us ?
us and major european airlines that fly the transatlantic route have all suffered loss of revenue from the four-day ban last week on flights to and from america .
going forward , many leisure travellers will be more inclined to stay home , or avoid taking long-haul flights , which will add to problems with over-capacity .
the crisis has also led to a battering of airline shares , halving the value of some companies in the us .
this has pushed up the interest cost of outstanding loans .
in addition , the attacks will lead to an increase in insurance premiums paid by carriers .
all airlines will also have to bear the added costs of extra security measures .
following the recent problems , dutch airline klm and virgin atlantic have announced that they will be cutting flights from october .
will european airlines be at a disadvantage if their us rivals receive financial aid ?
iata says the european companies would be at a " tremendous disadvantage " if they receive no assistance to deal with the crisis .
should the us airlines win substantial financial backing from congress , the european commission would be under enormous pressure from the industry and national governments to help its own airlines .
" not to react would be irrational on their part , " says iata 's mr gaillard .
" they would have on their conscience the demise of the european airline industry and thousands of lay-offs . "
what kind of financial aid would the european airlines receive ?
the us airlines are asking for a $ 24bn bail-out , but this has not yet been agreed to by congress .
the aid is expected to take the form of direct cash , guaranteed loans and possibly tax cuts .
in europe , the structure of any package would probably be adapted because the airlines are not as cash-strapped .
for example , they may receive cash and loans , but not tax relief necessarily .
the industry is also expecting regulators on both sides of the atlantic to relax restrictive rules on future mergers as a result of the crisis .
most analysts believe that the industry is too fragmented and needs to consolidate so that players can share costs and build greater economies of scale .
at the moment regulations provide a disincentive because merger partners are often forced to give up existing traffic rights .
what long-term impact will the attacks on the us have ?
it is difficult to forecast when passenger numbers might pick up again until it becomes clear what retaliatory action the us plans to take .
during the gulf war 10 years ago annual numbers shrunk for the first time in history , but then recovered after the military action was over .
as the enemy is more elusive in this latest conflict and has hit commercial aeroplanes directly , it is likely that travellers will remain apprehensive for some time to come .
what is the outlook for consumers ?
the only good news for travellers is that the cost of air tickets will probably come down .
when airlines have too much capacity and are desperate to fill seats , they inevitably sell tickets at a discount . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's patrick bartlett reports from frankfurt " european airlines are suffering from the impact of the us hijackings . "
