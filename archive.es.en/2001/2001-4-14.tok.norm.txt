riot police and a water cannon were deployed in the city centre , and opposition leaders called on their supporters to exercise restraint .
the crowds carried placards calling for the freeing of political prisoners and opposed to the internal security act , a draconian law allowing detention without trial , under which seven activists were arrested this week .
the activists were all members of wan azizah ismael 's national justice party , and included the party 's youth leader and vice-president .
the arrests came as the malaysian government went on the offensive against its critics abroad , warning against interference in malaysia 's treatment of mr anwar .
prime minister mahathir mohamad sacked his former protege in 1998 before trying him and jailing him .
mr mahathir says mr anwar received a fair trial and denies there was any conspiracy to remove him from power .
mr anwar is currently serving a 15-year jail sentence on the charges , which he says are fabricated .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- singing nuns pray for number one low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : entertainment front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo saturday , 14 april , 2001 , 07:04 gmt 08:04 uk singing nuns pray for number one the choir has reached number two in the charts by the bbc 's jenny mccudden a group of nuns from essex could be the new easter number one in the uk classical charts .
the sisters from the priory of the resurrection at new hall in chelmsford have put together a compilation of harmonious chant and hymns on an album entitled " eternal light " .
released last month , the album shot straight up to number two and has already sold 45,000 copies .
the music is our prayer .
after being approached by a record company , we agreed to share it sister margaret mary signed by leading label deutsche grammophon , the sisters are overwhelmed with the success so far .
it marks the first time that the sung worship of the group has been heard outside the convent chapel .
sister margaret mary said the project was very exciting .
" we 're just delighted that the music which is our prayer is being shared and enjoyed by other people . "
the nuns belong to the order of the holy sepulchre .
since 1642 , the order has sung prayers three times daily .
and still today , the music forms an integral part of daily life , drawn from the 900 year old traditions .
every dawn , noon and dusk a mesmerizing chant can be heard coming from the bright , quaint chapel situated in the convent .
the magnificent building was once a tudor palace with a strong historical background .
ironically for a catholic community , henry viii first met anne boleyn in new hall .
friends in high places like others in the industry , the sisters had contacts in the right places .
sister teresa explained that her nephew is involved in the record industry and after numerous visits to the chapel during the years he finally persuaded the nuns to take their music to a wider audience .
the prayers have been sung for hundreds of years " it 's not what we anticipated when we recorded last october .
but if we 're at number two and perhaps going to number one , that must mean there are thousands of people who are actually listening to our music . "
with record sales come the financial rewards and the sisters already have a number of projects which they hope will benefit from the proceeds .
no sports cars , cruise trips or houses in notting hill are on the agenda .
the nuns live a busy life , teaching and helping others and look instead for the more simple pleasures .
sister margaret mary has plans to contribute a small amount of money to the upkeep of a tranquil garden , surrounded by an old stone wall , with a large cherry tree dominating the centre .
we are a very open community and locals enjoy coming for service and are welcome to take part in our prayer sister teresa " this garden is a beautiful place to come and contemplate or simply pray , but access for the elderly and those with disabilities is a problem .
" we want ramps and new paths to make it more user friendly , so a little bit of the money shall go towards that . "
but more importantly , the order intends to send money to their sister convents in rwanda , the congo and brazil .
" our sisters have suffered terribly in rwanda and other places .
we lost six of our order in the rwandan massacre .
the convent was destroyed .
they lost everything . "
tour plans though only released a month ago , the album has already sold almost 50,000 copies and further success for the singing nuns can be expected .
mark wilkinson , of the record company believes the album will reach number one , knocking russell watson with his album the voice off the hot spot .
he also has more long term plans for the nuns , and would even like to see them tour .
" it 's going on release in ireland next week , then , italy , canada , australia and also in germany over the coming months , so i hope with a bit of encouragement they may tour those places . "
by easter sunday , the album could hit the number one spot , but even then the sisters at new hall will be going about their daily business , meeting and greeting guests , organising spiritual breaks and of course offering up their prayer in the chapel .

details of the deal are being kept secret , but court papers said it did not amount to an admission of liability on the part of mcdonald 's .
veronica martin filed a lawsuit claiming $ 110,000 damages for medical bills , lost wages and mental pain and anguish .
in 1994 , the burger chain had to pay a customer $ 500,000 after a cup of coffee fell into a woman 's lap and scalded her .
husband deprived veronica martin claimed she suffered a second degree burn on her chin after a scalding hot pickle fell from one of several small hamburgers which she and her husband bought from a mcdonald 's restaurant in knoxville , tennessee .
will it carry a new warning about hot pickles ?
her husband also sued for $ 15,000 , saying that he had been deprived of the services and companionship of his wife .
the lawsuit contended that the pickle was defective and unreasonably dangerous to the customer .
in its rebuttal , mcdonald 's insisted its product was safe .
the court papers say the case was settled to avoid the time and expense of a trial and was in no way an admission of liability on the part of mcdonald 's .
the fast food giant has been burned in the courts before .
pickle warning it was once ordered to pay $ 2.7m dollars to a woman who spilled a cup of coffee into her lap .
the damages were reduced on appeal to $ 500,000 .
but the implications of the case terrified businesses so much that they began to label their goods with warnings that are blindingly obvious .
most take-away coffee cups now bear a cautionary sign saying " hot coffee can be dangerous " .
what is not clear is whether mcdonald 's will now advise people that one of the consequences of not eating their hamburgers properly is that their spouses may be deprived of services and companionship .

graham mack abandoned his show on birmingham 's brmb radio station after rowing on air with the programme controller adam bridge .
mr mack refused to play the us rap star 's hit stan saying : " i decided not to play eminem .
the guy has been convicted of carrying a concealed weapon . "
i do n't pay you for opinions , i pay you to play what i tell you to play adam bridge eminem was found guilty of carrying a concealed weapon on tuesday and sentenced to two years ' probation in an american court .
listeners heard mr bridge , who did not realise he was on air , say : " i do n't pay you for opinions , i pay you to play what i tell you to play .
just play the bloody song . "
but mack refused to back down saying : " if you want eminem played this morning you better come down here and play it yourself . "
detroit incident eminem was given two years ' probation , fined $ 2,500 and ordered to undergo counselling and submit to drug testing at a michigan court .
the charges came after an incident outside a detroit nightclub in june last year when eminem - real name marshall mathers iii - saw a man kissing his wife kimberly .
the performer 's concerts in the uk earlier this year were picketed by gay and lesbian rights ' protesters who said his lyrics were sexist and homophobic .
' embarrassing ' couple married on the day they met for the first time brmb spokesman mike owen said the programme would soon be back on air .
he admitted mr mack 's criticism of the station was embarrassing .
" he would n't play the scheduled track and now we ca n't get hold of him . "
brmb is no stranger to controversy .
in january 1999 it arranged a " blind-date " style wedding where two listeners married each other despite never having met after winning a competition .
the stunt sparked strong protests from church leaders who said the move was " a dangerous and immoral experiment " .

graham mack abandoned his show on birmingham 's brmb radio station after rowing on air with the programme controller adam bridge .
mr mack refused to play the us rap star 's hit stan saying : " i decided not to play eminem .
the guy has been convicted of carrying a concealed weapon . "
i do n't pay you for opinions , i pay you to play what i tell you to play adam bridge eminem was found guilty of carrying a concealed weapon on tuesday and sentenced to two years ' probation in an american court .
listeners heard mr bridge , who did not realise he was on air , say : " i do n't pay you for opinions , i pay you to play what i tell you to play .
just play the bloody song . "
but mack refused to back down saying : " if you want eminem played this morning you better come down here and play it yourself . "
detroit incident eminem was given two years ' probation , fined $ 2,500 and ordered to undergo counselling and submit to drug testing at a michigan court .
the charges came after an incident outside a detroit nightclub in june last year when eminem - real name marshall mathers iii - saw a man kissing his wife kimberly .
the performer 's concerts in the uk earlier this year were picketed by gay and lesbian rights ' protesters who said his lyrics were sexist and homophobic .
' embarrassing ' brmb spokesman mike owen said the programme would soon be back on air .
he admitted mr mack 's criticism of the station was embarrassing .
" he would n't play the scheduled track and now we ca n't get hold of him . "
brmb is no stranger to controversy .
in january 1999 it arranged a " blind-date " style wedding where two listeners married each other despite never having met after winning a competition .
the stunt sparked strong protests from church leaders who said the move was " a dangerous and immoral experiment " .

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- catholic schools praised by moderator low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo saturday , 14 april , 2001 , 11:11 gmt 12:11 uk catholic schools praised by moderator the church of scotland favoured non-denominational schools scotland 's system of catholic schools has found favour with the church of scotland 's most senior figure .
the moderator of the church of scotland 's general assembly praised catholic schools for their role in breaking down sectarianism during the post-war era .
in an interview to be broadcast on bbc radio scotland on easter sunday , the rt rev dr andrew mclellan said the last 30 had shown that catholic schools were " a very good thing " .
dr mclellan 's wife teaches at a catholic school and during his year in office he became the first serving moderator to preach at st mary 's catholic cathedral in glasgow .
the general assembly has traditionally supported the principle of establishing integrated , non-denominational schools in scotland .
rev dr mclellan preached at a catholic cathedral but speaking on stark talk , dr mclellan said : " i think as long as we have catholic schools , catholic schools are a very good thing .
" anyone brought up , as i was , in the west of scotland , would want to do anything to break down divisions between catholics and protestants and break down sectarianism .
" the open-minded and enthusiastic teaching of religion in the catholic school i know best is a very impressive model for other schools .
" it is the very existence of catholic schools which has done most over the last 30 years in scotland to break down sectarian divisions , because catholic schools have done most to help roman catholics to be better educated , more confident and more able to break out of the poverty and exclusion which was their lot . "
during his term of office , dr mclellan was granted an audience with the pope in rome , which he described as " one of the high points of the year " .
' i think we ought to weep ' he said : " i think i did feel very respectful .
even though he is not well , you 're still conscious that you are in the presence of someone very special and that he communicates both gentleness and toughness . "
on the issue of faslane , where dr mclellan led a controversial outdoor multi-faith service as protesters blocked the entrances to the submarine base , he insisted he was merely reflecting the general assembly 's long-standing opposition to nuclear weapons .
rev dr mclellan was impressed by the pope dr mclellan was criticised in some quarters for being present at the protest and accused of becoming too heavily involved in political issues at the expense of his pastoral role .
he said : " i wanted the focus to be that the church of scotland general assembly year in , year out , has been entirely clear in its opposition to nuclear weapons in general and trident in particular , and i think my presence there made that clear .
" it seems to me absolutely clear that you can be totally opposed to a government policy and at the same time supportive of those who serve in the royal navy and of those who work as ministers in the royal navy . "
dr mclellan also touched on the subject of scotland 's prisons following his visit to all the country 's jails , including camp zeist in holland .
he said prisons had improved in terms of atmosphere and relations between staff and inmates over the last 20 years .
but he added : " on the level of who are in scotland 's prisons and what has happened to their lives and what side of scotland they are representing , i think we ought to weep . "
stark talk , bbc radio scotland , sunday 15 april , at 2330bst , to be repeated on monday 16 april 2010bst .
