the ponies are being sold to prevent overcrowding on the moor , which could lead to serious animal welfare problems as winter sets in .
the tavistock livestock centre only got permission to hold the auction last week .
this was after work was carried out at the centre to help it meet welfare and hygiene standards to prevent the spread of diseases such as foot-and-mouth .
' good news ' in the past , some of the animals have been sold for as little as £ 1 .
half of this year 's dartmoor pony sales were cancelled , mostly because of foot-and-mouth animal movement restrictions which were brought in following the outbreak of the virus in february .
sale organisers have had inquiries from all over the country from both private dealers and animal sanctuaries .
john weir , from dartmoor national park authority , said : " it 's all good news .
the signs are there is a market for ponies . "

mr putin made the announcement in a televised statement on thursday night , pledging to cut russia 's stockpile from about 6,000 warheads to between 1,500 and 2,200 , in response to a similar commitment made by us president george w bush .
but mr putin criticised mr bush 's decision to withdraw from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with russia , officially announced on thursday .
this step was not a surprise for us .
however , we consider it a mistake russian president vladimir putin mr putin said the us 's withdrawal was a mistake , but it would not harm russia 's security interests .
us officials welcomed mr putin 's measured tone .
a white house spokesman said : " russia 's announcement of nuclear reductions and its commitment to continue to conduct close negotiations with the united states reflect our shared desire to continue the essential work of building a new relationship for a new century . "
mr bush 's announcement that the us was withdrawing from the abm treaty had been expected .
" i have concluded the abm treaty hinders our government 's ability to develop ways to protect our people from future terrorist or rogue state missile attacks , " mr bush said after meeting with his national security council .
russia warning " defending the american people is my highest priority as commander in chief and i can not and will not allow the united states to remain in a treaty that prevents us from developing effective defences , " mr bush said .
he had informed congressional leaders of his decision on wednesday .
earlier on thursday , the us ambassador in moscow delivered a formal document informing the russian government of the decision and invoking article 15 of the treaty , which gives russia six months ' notice before the treaty expires .
" this step was not a surprise for us .
however , we consider it a mistake , " mr putin said in a national television broadcast .
the cold war is long gone .
today we leave behind one of its last vestiges .
president george bush " i fully believe that the decision taken by the president of the united states does not pose a threat to the national security of the russian federation , " he said .
russia had previously warned that a us withdrawal would trigger a new nuclear arms race and weaken international security .
but moscow has softened its line in recent months .
the russian prime minister , mikhail kasyanov , said on thursday that the decision was " a cause of annoyance " for moscow , but that washington was within its rights .
click here for details of the nuclear balance president bush also emphasised that russia had no reason to be afraid .
" the cold war is long gone , " mr bush said .
" today we leave behind one of its last vestiges .
but this is not a day for looking back .
this is a day for looking forward with hope of greater prosperity and peace . "
' agreement with putin ' the president said that before making his decision he had consulted his security advisers and had discussed the issues with " my friend president vladimir putin , " over several meetings this year .
but the withdrawal was criticised by democrat leaders in the american congress , who worry it could undermine arms control and antagonise russia and china , despite mr bush 's assurances .
mr bush says that states like north korea and iran are ambitiously pursuing weapons of mass destruction and proposes a missile defence system to combat the threat .
mr putin has been firmly opposed to the system , saying it would destroy the existing nuclear balance and create a new arms race .
he has said it could eventually undermine the russian nuclear deterrent .
after president bush 's announcement , the french foreign ministry called for a new international arms agreement to replace the abm .
" beyond the american-russian bilateral relationship , the need to continue to ensure stability in this new global context remains a task for us all , " the ministry statement said .
" that supposes , in particular , rules and binding international measures , as much bilateral as multilateral . "
sweden criticised the us decision to withdraw .
a foreign ministry statement warned of possibly " serious consequences for the future of international disarmament " .

mr walker lindh was taken into custody by us forces following a bloody prison uprising in mazar-e-sharif in november .
john walker lindh grew up in northern california a videotape was released earlier of him being questioned by cia paramilitary officer johnny " mike " spann .
mr spann was later killed in that prison uprising .
before being returned to the us , the 20-year-old californian was held in a shipping container surrounded by barbed wire at the us marines forward base - camp rhino in afghanistan - where he was recovering from a gunshot wound .
attorney general john ashcroft has not said what legal actions the government will take against mr walker lindh and defence secretary donald rumsfeld refused to comment when asked if he had betrayed his country .

nahshon nahumi , who repairs backyard hot tubs in the hills above mr walker lindh 's mother 's house , told the local paper : " i do n't think it 's a big deal for young people to have weird ideas .

some americans want him executed others coming to his defence include abdulla nana , a 23-year-old fellow muslim who is a close friend and prayed with mr walker lindh at the local islamic centre in marin .

in the june 2000 general election his young party , the movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- , inflicted a stunning blow on the ruling zanu-pf party 's usual iron grip on power .
the mdc gained 57 of the constituency-based seats , against 62 held by zanu-pf - a result without precedent in zimbabwe , where opposition parties had never held more than a handful of seats .
mr tsvangirai himself was not elected .
turning down the opportunity of a seat in one of the cities , where the mdc 's support is strongest , the mdc leader chose instead to stand in his home district - which , like most rural constituencies , was won by zanu-pf .
by helping to inflict a dramatic defeat on the government over its constitutional reform bill the previous february , mr tsvangirai won an aura of credibility which was enhanced by the general election result .
click here to watch the bbc hardtalk interview with morgan tsvangirai .
mr tsvangirai has been performing a delicate political operation - attempting to maintain popularity and political momentum whilst holding together the very disparate interest groups gathered under the mdc umbrella .
born in 1952 in buhera in eastern zimbabwe , morgan tsvangirai was the eldest son of a bricklayer .
the young morgan left secondary school to become a textile weaver , but then went to work in a mine in bindera , north-east of harare , where he became involved in union actitivies and rose rapidly to become leader of the mining union .
a political force in the late 1980s , mr tsvangirai became head of the zimbabwe congress of trade unions , which had been set up at zimbabwe 's independence .
but it was another decade before he really emerged as a political force .
in december 1997 and early 1998 , mr tsvangirai led a series of strikes - so-called " stay-aways " - against tax increases which brought the country to a standstill .
these forced the government of president mugabe to cancel two tax increases and , as it turned out , also to abandon a promised tax to help fund war veterans ' pensions .
a pointer to the future this was an ironic foreshadowing of the political confrontation between the veterans and mr tsvangirai 's supporters over the issue of farm occupations .
in 1999 mr tsvangirai helped to create the mdc .
within months , the new party had defeated the government over its referendum on constitutional reform , which included clauses allowing the seizure of white-owned farms without compensation .
it was the most dramatic political set-back for president mugabe since independence .
but even this was eclipsed by the mdc 's election showing .
mr tsvangirai is seen as representing a younger generation of zimbabweans , particularly urban workers , who are less interested in mr mugabe 's historical role as zimbabwe 's founding father than what they see as his recent record of economic mismanagement .

the forecast came as the company said its profits fell during the july to september quarter compared with a year earlier .
" it was our toughest quarter in a decade , " said chief executive larry ellison .
" when the economy improves , we will earn a lot more . "
fine future analysts had expected the fall in profits , so oracle 's share price slipped only slightly on the news before rising as investors took in an optimistic growth forecast .

the software giant 's fight for market share , in a business where its main competitors include the computer firms microsoft and ibm , has been extremely tough in recent months .
