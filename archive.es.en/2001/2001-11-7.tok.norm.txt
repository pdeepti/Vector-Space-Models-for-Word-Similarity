the eu is dropping legal action against the government over pollution on the blackpool coast after all beaches in the area met water quality standards for the first time .
many of britain 's coastal resorts have suffered for years from poor water quality caused mainly by the dumping of sewage into the sea .
but major investment in better treatment works by water companies has proved successful and the latest figures show that this summer , 98 % of bathing beaches in england and wales met minimum eu standards , compared with 91 % just two years ago .
these results will probably do more to help the regeneration of coastal resorts by improving the reputation of beaches than any other single investment michael meacher , environment minister all the beaches along the fylde coast , including blackpool , now meet those standards for the first time .
pollution in this area had been so bad that the eu was taking the uk to court .
that action has now been dropped , saving the taxpayer about £ 70,000 a day in legal costs .
environment minister michael meacher said : " these results will probably do more to help the regeneration of coastal resorts by improving the reputation of beaches than any other single investment .
" the uk coastal bathing water quality results were also the best ever .
regional variation " there were 546 uk coastal bathing waters sampled this year ; 95 % passed and that was slightly up on last year which was 94 % . "
mr meacher said that britain had a european court of justice judgment outstanding because of a failure to comply in 1996/97 .
he said : " we will do our best to contest this , but the dramatic improvements since then will not be taken into account by the court of justice . "
he said more needed to be done , but he thought achieving 100 % compliance was " probably impossible " .
statistics show there is still wide regional variation , with one in eight beaches in northwest england still breaking eu rules , while the north east shows a 100 % pass rate .
investment totalling £ 600m in england and wales is committed up to 2005 .
it will fund further clean-up improvements and will be targeted at more than 100 sewage treatment works and several hundred storm overflows . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's kevin bocquet in blackpool " it 's taken a lot of hard work " see also : 05 jun 01 -pipe- uk blue flag beaches 2001 21 feb 01 -pipe- uk beach litter threat to marine life 04 dec 00 -pipe- uk uk beaches cleaner than ever 28 jul 00 -pipe- uk eu action over dirty beaches 31 may 00 -pipe- wales red faces over blue flags internet links : blue flag campaign water quality in the eu the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories now : postcode lottery in gp services leanne killer jailed for life tories attack brixton drugs scheme straw defends arms sales change ivf mix-up heads for court police shoot man on the m6 new challenge excites venables judge urges life sentence shake-up links to more uk stories are at the foot of the page .

comdex fall 2001 150,000 attendees expected 2,300 companies participating $ 200m local economic impact but the numbers attending the seven-day event are expected to be affected heavily by the twin traumas of a faltering us economy and the recent terror attacks in new york and washington .
security hassles and fears over air travel have colluded to drive down the number of participants by 25 % , from the 200,000 people who went to last year 's comdex .
the technology rout of the past year has also taken a toll on attendance .
some firms have been so stricken they can not afford to send representatives , while other businesses have shut up shop or merged .
nevertheless , more than 2,300 information technology -lrb- it -rrb- firms are expected to push their wares at the annual geekfest .
modest beginnings comdex is an annual tech fest that not only allows companies to display their latest wares but to strike the biggest deals .
microsoft chairman bill gates regularly attends comdex the first comdex -lrb- computer dealer expo -rrb- meeting was held over three days in december 1979 and featured just 160 companies .
four thousand people attended the first event .
among the products featured at that conference was the first-ever dot matrix printer for personal computers .
that same year , office-networking ethernet technology was introduced along with a new service called compuserve , which allowed its users to send e-mail , among other things .
the annual meeting has since established itself as an influential summit of industry leaders .
microsoft chairman bill gates first addressed the influential conference in 1983 and has done so each year since .
other industry big wigs in recent years to address comdex include hewlett-packard chief executive carly fiorina and oracle chief executive larry ellison .
legacy of the attacks the 11 september terror attacks that assailed the world trade center and the pentagon have had a sizable impact on the tourism industry in the us .
las vegas , a gambling and entertainment mecca , in the first few weeks following the attacks endured a measurable decline in hotel reservations and gamblers to its casinos .
hotel room rates fell by as much as half , including those along the famous las vegas strip , said ray vastola , president of quikbook , a hotel-room reservation service .
hotel room cancellations have since tapered off , thanks in part to innovative schemes by casinos delivered via e-mail to regular clients , offering special rates on hotel rooms .
" -lsb- hotels -rsb- are giving unbelievable rates ... and that 's helping , " mr vastola said , adding that rooms cost anywhere from 25 % to 50 % less than before 11 september .
with the two-month anniversary of the attacks looming , tourism in las vegas seems to have made a rebound , with no major conventions scheduled for november and beyond having been cancelled - but there is still a long way to go .
coming of age it is perhaps no coincidence that in the past 20 years , during which it hosted every comdex event , las vegas has moved beyond its dusty , desert roots to become one of the country 's premier cities , while at the same time the personal computer has evolved from a crude device to an essential communications tool for home and office .
equally , las vegas 's economic boom of the late ' 90s coincided with the run-up in technology shares on the nasdaq .
both offered unheard of opportunities to novice gamblers , be they adherents of games of chance or the stock market .
but now both landscapes have changed .
and just as the it industry has had to adjust to a new economic reality , so too must las vegas .
given the current crises , attendees to this year 's comdex conference will not only be keen to see the latest in gee-whiz gadgetry but eager to hear what industry sages have to say about it 's - and the country 's - future .

the seven-week course , costing £ 85 with 21 hours of tuition , will teach desperate cooks how to dish up both modern and traditional fare .
the 12 students will be taught how to make a roast turkey with a chestnut and wild mushroom stuffing , but for those with a bit of nerve , there is pheasant in a hunter 's sauce .
raj mandal , head of catering at bedford college , said : " they will learn everything except how to cook figgy pudding , simply because the ones you can buy in the shops are good enough . "
a variety of puddings are on the menu six men and six women have signed up for the course , and the youngest student is 25 years old .
" we did n't get any very young people interested .
i guess they 'll be eating kebabs for christmas , " mr mandal said .
he added : " cooking christmas dinner can be the most stressful time of the year .
" what surprised me is that we have just as much interest from men , who by tradition merely cut the turkey after a woman has done all the hard work .
" nearly £ 100 seems a bit steep but all the equipment and ingredients are free .
it is very worth while and we are not out to make a profit .
bilberry pie " some who have enrolled are having to cook for a large family for the first time and others are looking for some fresh ideas as they have been cooking the same roast for years .
" once they have finished this course , people will be able to really impress their mother-in-law for years to come .

the supersonic aircraft has been through a complete refit , with a series of safety modifications to gain its certificate of airworthiness after being grounded for 15 months .
both british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- and air france are operating flights to new york on wednesday , although ba will not relaunch fare-paying passenger flights until friday .
it is with great pride that we welcome this symbol of european and american commerce back to new york rudolph giuliani , new york mayor " concorde is back and its return comes at a symbolic time , " said ba chief executive rod eddington .
new york 's mayor rudolph giuliani , who will welcome concorde 's return to his home city , said : " new york has been home to concorde for more than 20 years and it is with great pride that we welcome this symbol of european and american commerce back to new york . "
the first concorde to arrive in the us will be an air france plane , carrying fare-paying passengers and leaving paris at 0930gmt .
the ba flight , leaving at 1030gmt , will carry business leaders , the aviation industry and the media .
flight schedules ba will initially operate a six-times-a-week london to new york service , with weekly heathrow to barbados flights beginning in december .
mr eddington said : " british business leaders have been invited on this first flight as a thank you for their support for concorde over the years and to reaffirm our commitment to business travel between the uk and the us .
" we look forward to carrying our customers supersonically on our flagship plane for many years to come . "
ba 's chief concorde pilot , mike bannister , will be the commander on wednesday 's london to new york flight .
he will take the aircraft to heights of almost 60,000ft and speeds of up to 1,350mph in a trip that is likely to take just three hours 20 minutes .

" the fact that so many states have joined the federal government in supporting this agreement is a very significant positive step toward resolving these issues once and for all , " said chairman bill gates .
talks with a further nine states are believed to be ongoing , long after a deadline set by judge colleen kollar-kotelly , with at least three of these states thought to be sitting on the fence .
" we hope that the remaining states will join in this agreement , so that everyone can focus on the future and avoid the unnecessary costs and delays of further litigation , " mr gates said .
the latest twist to this dramatic saga came just hours after the software giant 's lawyer john warden said : " microsoft believes the settlement process has come to an end , or will come to an end -lsb- later today -rsb- " .
microsoft 's apparent rejection of the judge 's invitation for more time may have bought it more support for the settlement with the federal government .
uncertain future the judge is fully entitled to dismiss the federal settlement agreement altogether and start remedy hearings to decide on penalties against microsoft .
if she does , the remedy hearings would start in march 2002 and could go on for a very long time .
but she could also decide to hold a public review of the revised settlement agreement that appears to have been accepted by nine states .
and , say observers , she may in fact allow this settlement .
some observers believe the judge may also allow the states that are willing to continue the fight to enter into separate litigation in parallel with such a public review .
either way , this last minute hitch to the settlement is seen as bad news for microsoft , especially as analysts had viewed the settlement as a very good deal with the added benefit of removing uncertainty over the issue .
the deal microsoft 's deal with the federal government had been reached under a fast-track process set up by new trial judge ms kollar-kotelly .
the software giant had been reluctant to accept any major alterations to the consent decree it had negotiated with the department of justice .
late-night negotiations between representatives of the 18 state attorneys general and microsoft through a court-appointed mediator failed to produce substantive changes .
but in the end , nine states were granted certain modifications or clarifications that convinced them it was ok .
slap on the wrist ?
several states , led by california , massachusetts and connecticut , argued that the federal deal would have allowed microsoft to proceed with its anti-competitive activities largely unchecked .
in the outcome of a three-and-a-half year court case , the company had been found guilty of abusing its dominant position in the software market .
however , the original punishment - splitting the company into two - was subsequently set aside after microsoft appealed .

following the cut , the cost of borrowing in the us has fallen sharply below the annual rate of inflation , currently running at 2.6 % .
borrowing of money is therefore , in effect , subsidised .
this , the us authorities hope , should encourage consumers to spend more money and businesses to re-launch investment projects shelved as the economy began to turn down earlier this year .
this was the 10th time the federal reserve , under chairman alan greenspan , cut rates this year as part of its efforts to boost the flagging us economy .
the fed 's decision to cut was unanimous .
president george w bush 's government has also attempted to boost economic growth by increasing government spending and by pushing a multi-billion dollar tax relief and industry bail-out package through congress .
taken for granted ahead of the cut , a slew of downbeat economic data had led many observers to predict the fed 's decision .
last week , official figures showed that the us economy shrank for the first time in eight years during the three months to september , contracting by 0.4 % and shedding nearly half a million jobs .
separate data showed that us consumer spending , which has been credited with keeping recession at bay , posted its sharpest monthly decline in 14 years after the 11 september terrorist attacks .
in a poll carried out by the reuters news agency , 15 out of 24 analysts predicted a 0.50 % cut , while the remainder forecast a 0.25 % reduction .
market moves on tuesday , ahead of the cut , the euro fell to $ 0.89 in anticipation of a hefty rate cut , while the dow jones index of leading us shares rose by over 1 % on monday .
many economists agreed with the federal reserve 's decision , though some said it would be ineffective in persuading people to keep spending given the prevailing gloom following 11 september and due to the subsequent anthrax attacks .
others argued that with the cost of borrowing already at near-record lows ahead of the latest cuts , the fed should have postponed the decision until the full extent of the us downturn was known .
