the work , carried out by scientists at the department of infectious disease epidemiology at imperial college in london , predicts that when the current foot-and-mouth epidemic eases , it will have affected between 44 and 64 per cent of the animal population at risk .
there are 45,000 farms in high-risk areas like cumbria , dumfries and galloway , and devon .
the total number of farms in all areas of the uk is 131,000 , the report says .
extensive culling is sadly the only option for controlling the current british epidemic .
imperial college study the imperial college study looked at how the disease has spread so far in the uk .
it says that the faster animals are slaughtered after a case is identified , the faster the disease will be halted .
" extensive culling is sadly the only option for controlling the current british epidemic , and it is essential that the control measures now in pace be maintained during the long decay phase of the epidemic , " say the researchers , who have published their work in the journal science .
ring culling they recommend combining rapid slaughter of infected animals with " ring culling " - the killing of all at risk animals within a 1.5 kilometre -lrb- 1,640 yard -rrb- radius of each infected farm .
the ministry of agriculture , forestry and fisheries -lrb- maff -rrb- says that these measures are already official policy , but it admits there are problems putting policy into action .
" our aim is , as far as is humanly possible , to meet these targets .
" we are killing 100 per cent of infected animals within 30 hours , but we are not doing as well on meeting the 48 hour target for preemptive slaughtering , " a maff spokeswoman told bbc news online .
" we are training up more slaughtermen and working closely with the army , stepping up in every area to try and improve the situation , " she said , adding that efforts were being concentrated in areas of particular concern .
" aggressive policies " the imperial college researchers warn that short delays in slaughter lead to much higher infectivity .
" maximum benefits are only gained by aggressive policies that reduce transmission below the critical level required for the epidemic to be self-sustaining .
" clear communication of this basic epidemiological principle is key . "
progress made in late march towards speeding up slaughter has slowed the epidemic , but without rapid and effective ring culling , the epidemic will grow , they say .
next time around the study goes on to call for an international review of policy on foot-and-mouth .
it proposes : working out how to stop foot-and-mouth re-entering the country from infected countries , developing a reliable test to distinguish infected animals from vaccinated ones , analysing the costs and benefits of vaccination instead of slaughter in infrequent outbreaks , and finding ways of minimising delays between disease reporting and slaughter .

economics minister taro aso said a slide back into recession was a real possibility .

ldp leadership race he is one of four mps running for leadership of the ruling liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- .
former prime minister ryutaro hashimoto is a frontrunner in the race to succeed the unpopular incumbent , yoshiro mori .
the government used the word " weakening " on friday for the first time since september 1995 to describe japan 's ailing economy .
the monthly report downgraded the assessment of several key sectors , including jobs , housing , profits and business sentiment .
" the economy is weakening , reflecting the slowdown of the us economy , " it said .
