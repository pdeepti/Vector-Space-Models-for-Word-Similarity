a group representing the commission on medical aspects of radiation in the environment , which advises the government on the health effects of naturally occurring and man-made radiation , has visited sandside beach .
the owner of the beach commissioned an independent report which claims that just 1 % of the radioactive particles present in the sand are being detected .
however , the advisors said they were satisfied with the current monitoring regime , but further research may be required .
on a scheduled trip to the dounreay nuclear plant in caithness , the group visited the nearby beach at sandside where a number of radioactive particles , which could have leaked from the nuclear site , have been discovered and removed .
it said the level of monitoring currently taking place on the beach was satisfactory .
the group sought to allay public health fears , but agreed that further research into sand movement may be needed .
an estimated 17 radioactive particles have been found on sandside beach since monitoring started in 1983 .
the particles , which are the size of a grain of sand , are believed to have come from the plant , although the exact source has never been identified .

the new green public transport project has won european commission money and is believed to be the world 's largest solar-hydrogen energy project .

sunlight will be converted into electricity which is then used to split water into hydrogen and oxgen .

colin saunders , usher 's project manager , said : " this project is a totally green alternative to oil , it is transport from sunshine .
" the scheme is an operational demonstration of areas of technology that are under research within the university . "

a similar project will have solar panels on roofs of buildings in the swedish island of gotland .
it is hoped that the buses , which will run from the west cambridge development to the city centre , will encourage greener transport solutions .
ben madden , of whitby bird and partners , said : " this project has allowed us to demonstrate how hydrogen allows renewable energy to be stored and used in transport .
" we hope usher will raise global interest and encourage the uptake of similar technologies , acting as the first step on the path leading us out of our climate-changing fossil-fuel based economy . "
detailed work on the project is due to start in the new year and it is expected to be completed in september 2003 .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- third florida anthrax case categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : americas front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 11 october , 2001 , 05:40 gmt 06:40 uk third florida anthrax case the fbi is investigating the anthrax outbreak a third person has tested positive for anthrax in florida , prompting officials to launch a criminal investigation into the source of the disease .
she is believed to be an employee of the same tabloid newspaper publishing company for which two victims worked .
a 63-year-old photo editor died from the disease earlier this month .
the development came as us embassies abroad were told to stock up on the antibiotic ciprofloxacin as a precaution in case of anthrax attacks .
every american should be vigilant attorney general john ashcroft but although officials said the case was now a criminal investigation , they emphasised that there was no evidence linking the anthrax to the 11 september plane attacks on the us .
the condition of the latest victim , a 35-year-old woman , is not known , but she has been hospitalised and is being treated with antibiotics .
she was one of hundreds of people who came forward for testing in florida after the first anthrax cases emerged .
americans are still waiting for the results of an investigation into the first two florida anthrax cases .
the man who died was the first to succumb to anthrax in the us since 1976 - the other victim was found to have spores in his nasal passages .
one witness said it was like being in an episode of the x-files computer security experts , for their part , were expected to warn congress on wednesday of the possibility of a terrorist attack on systems responsible for communications , power or water .
" to put it simply , we need more people to be doing more creative thinking about computer security .
that 's what our adversaries are doing , " the chairman of the house science committee , sherwood boehlert , told the associated press .
ongoing investigation federal investigators are comparing the strains of anthrax found in florida against known strains kept at a national repository in arizona .
initial tests of the anthrax found in florida match strains produced for research purposes in the 1950s at a laboratory in the state of iowa .
although those strains may have been widely distributed , investigators say that if the match is confirmed , it would rule out the possibility that the men contracted anthrax by natural or accidental causes .
envelopes containing a white powder have been mailed to about a dozen locations around florida , but a state health official told the new york times that they were probably a hoax .
strains of anthrax respiratory : similar beginnings to flu but shock occurs between two and six days later - frequently fatal intestinal : severe food poisoning type symptoms - up to 50 % mortality cutaneous : rarely painful skin lesion - fatal in one in 20 cases in the wake of us retaliatory strikes against afghanistan which began on sunday , government officials have urged police and private security agencies to take extra precautions .
" i encourage all americans to have a heightened sense of awareness of their surroundings , " attorney general john ashcroft said .
" i ask them to report suspicious activity to our partners in law enforcement .
every american should be vigilant . "
the government officially stands at a level 3 state of alert , indicating that there is potential for a terrorist attack but no specific and credible threat .
incidents a number of incidents since the 11 september attacks have kept americans on edge .
a subway station near washington dc was shut down for six hours on tuesday when a man sprayed a substance into the air and scuffled with police .
passengers subdued a man who tried to disrupt a flight tests showed that the substance was a cleaning agent , but passengers on the train reported feeling ill after the incident .
local officials say their symptoms could be the result of pepper spray used by officers in subduing kenneth ranger , 23 , who has been charged with attempted murder of a police officer .
a day earlier , passengers and pilots on an american airlines flight subdued a passenger who broke into the cockpit during a flight from los angeles to chicago .
the plane , with 162 people aboard , landed safely .
edward coburn , 31 , has been charged with interfering with a flight crew .
and on wednesday , a delta airlines flight from atlanta to los angeles was diverted after the pilot reported a disturbance in the cabin . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's nick bryant " investigators are still trying to find answers " journalist dale king from the boca raton news " they have n't linked it directly to the terroists " the loya jirga political healing what is a loya jirga ?

she is believed to be an employee of the same tabloid newspaper publishing company for which two victims worked .
a 63-year-old photo editor died from the disease earlier this month .
the development came as us embassies abroad were told to stock up on the antibiotic ciprofloxacin as a precaution in case of anthrax attacks .
every american should be vigilant attorney general john ashcroft but although officials said the case was now a criminal investigation , they emphasised that there was no evidence linking the anthrax to the 11 september plane attacks on the us .
the condition of the latest victim , a 35-year-old woman , is not known , but she has been hospitalised and is being treated with antibiotics .
she was one of hundreds of people who came forward for testing in florida after the first anthrax cases emerged .
americans are still waiting for the results of an investigation into the first two florida anthrax cases .
the man who died was the first to succumb to anthrax in the us since 1976 - the other victim was found to have spores in his nasal passages .
computer security experts , for their part , were expected to warn congress on wednesday of the possibility of a terrorist attack on systems responsible for communications , power or water .
" to put it simply , we need more people to be doing more creative thinking about computer security .
that 's what our adversaries are doing , " the chairman of the house science committee , sherwood boehlert , told the associated press .
ongoing investigation federal investigators are comparing the strains of anthrax found in florida against known strains kept at a national repository in arizona .
initial tests of the anthrax found in florida match strains produced for research purposes in the 1950s at a laboratory in the state of iowa .
although those strains may have been widely distributed , investigators say that if the match is confirmed , it would rule out the possibility that the men contracted anthrax by natural or accidental causes .
envelopes containing a white powder have been mailed to about a dozen locations around florida , but a state health official told the new york times that they were probably a hoax .
strains of anthrax respiratory : similar beginnings to flu but shock occurs between two and six days later - frequently fatal intestinal : severe food poisoning type symptoms - up to 50 % mortality cutaneous : rarely painful skin lesion - fatal in one in 20 cases in the wake of us retaliatory strikes against afghanistan which began on sunday , government officials have urged police and private security agencies to take extra precautions .
" i encourage all americans to have a heightened sense of awareness of their surroundings , " attorney general john ashcroft said .
" i ask them to report suspicious activity to our partners in law enforcement .
every american should be vigilant . "
the government officially stands at a level 3 state of alert , indicating that there is potential for a terrorist attack but no specific and credible threat .
incidents a number of incidents since the 11 september attacks have kept americans on edge .
a subway station near washington dc was shut down for six hours on tuesday when a man sprayed a substance into the air and scuffled with police .
tests showed that the substance was a cleaning agent , but passengers on the train reported feeling ill after the incident .
local officials say their symptoms could be the result of pepper spray used by officers in subduing kenneth ranger , 23 , who has been charged with attempted murder of a police officer .
a day earlier , passengers and pilots on an american airlines flight subdued a passenger who broke into the cockpit during a flight from los angeles to chicago .
the plane , with 162 people aboard , landed safely .
edward coburn , 31 , has been charged with interfering with a flight crew .
and on wednesday , a delta airlines flight from atlanta to los angeles was diverted after the pilot reported a disturbance in the cabin .

news corp has been in talks for a year to acquire hughes electronics - the owner of directv - from general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- .
mr murdoch 's bid has been shaken in recent months by a rival approach from echostar , the number-two us satellite tv company , and by fears that the effects of the september attacks could undermine the fundamentals of the deal .
gm said recently that sharp falls in hughes ' share price could make patching together an agreement " more difficult " .
speaking at news corp 's annual general meeting , mr murdoch said : " it would be wrong for me to say there is a deal but we are having friendly and useful discussions . "
but he said he remained only " 50-50 " confident that news corp would emerge the winner .
some analysts share his reserves .
" i would have thought that most investors have decided by now that he has lost that particular battle .
i think 50-50 is better than most people are expecting , " intersuisse director andrew sekely told the bbc 's world business report .
still bullish mr murdoch said he was still bullish about the future for news corp , despite admitting that the group had lost around $ 100m as a result of the post-attack slump in advertising .
the advertising market has bounced back already , he said , and current bookings have been the strongest in months .
the thirst for news produced by the international situation has boosted the underlying performance of news corp assets such as fox news , despite the increased expense involved with reporting the afghanistan conflict .
" we think with the mix of businesses that we have and the cash reserves that we have , we are a great deal better placed than all our competitors , " mr murdoch said .
mr murdoch did , however , rule out making any fresh investments .
buoyed by mr murdoch 's positive outlook , news corp 's shares bounced by almost 8 % in trading in new york and sydney .
news corp relies on the us market for 70 % of its revenues .

a " heated discussion " between mark oaten , mp for winchester , and one of his farmer constituents , charlie flindt , led to the decision to reverse roles .
mr oaten said he was only willing to shadow mr flindt , of manor farm , hinton ampner , on thursday if the farmer undertook a " constituency day " on friday .
mr oaten told bbc news online : " fortunately i do n't have to be up for the early morning milking , but from 0815 bst i will be down on the farm .
mr oaten was challenged over coffee " charlie challenged me to it when he said ' i would n't be able to last one day in the job ' . "
mr oaten will witness firsthand how hampshire 's rural economy has been affected by foot-and-mouth .

speaking from the farm , he said : " most farmers got into the trade to get away from paperwork , but the eu is forcing us to do more and more . "
recently imposed foot-and-mouth regulations have made the problem worse , and the prospect of increasing numbers of new eu laws is also not helping .
mr flindt said : " currently , there is a proposal to restrict the number of hours a farmer can spend in a tractor to three a day , as a health directive .
" but that kind of idea is impossible to stick to if i 'm to get all my work done . "
as for becoming an mp , mr flindt said he was interested to see how much power a local politician still has .
he said : " i just wonder how much can be done for a constituent when they come into a surgery with a problem . "

declaring that his " greatest mission " will be the reform of british schools and hospitals , he said he wanted to bring them up the level enjoyed in france and germany .
wednesday 's address marked the close of the shortened gathering in blackpool , which has been overshadowed by the us-led strikes in afghanistan . "
that is our greatest mission at home over the coming years : to assemble the coalition of charities and churches , the public and private sectors that will deliver results " iain duncan smith the tory leader focused much of his address on the international situation , branding osama bin laden a coward who " skulks in caves " while followers die for his pathological cause .
he expressed continued backing for the war against terrorism but warned that britain was now engaged in a " ferocious conflict , a struggle for civilisation itself " .
elsewhere in his speech mr duncan smith made an unexpected gesture towards making the party more inclusive as he said women , ethnic minorities and people with different lifestyles had to have greater opportunities .
but his core message to party representatives was how the tories must focus on reform of the uk 's schools and hospitals .
many in the party believe it did not place enough emphasis on public services during the election campaign .
public service drive mr duncan smith said : " in our country , the sick can not get the treatment they need .
in many of our inner cities the young do not receive the education they deserve .
" i call that shaming .
" we are the fourth richest country on earth .
we should be providing public services that match those of our european neighbours not those of the third world . "
he said tory governments of the 1980s and early 1990s addressed the uk 's economic failures and now attention had to switch to insecurity , economic instability and improving public services . "
bin laden claims to speak for islam , but he can not " iain duncan smith in a reference to the ongoing labour party debate over using private firms to deliver public services , mr duncan smith argued : " our european neighbours simply enjoy better hospitals , because they put the needs of their people before the demands of dogma .
" if we are to live up to the demands of a new century we must do the same .
" that is our greatest mission at home over the coming years : to assemble the coalition of charities and churches , the public and private sectors that will deliver results . "
his party will have an open mind on public service reform , the conservative leader promised , but will also use the " best of british innovation , enterprise and energy " .
euro opposition mr duncan smith also restated his opposition to joining the euro and drew on nato 's role in the current action against terrorism to criticise the " european army " proposals as " dangerous " .
but there was also a move to show he is not generally anti-european as he outlined plans to draw ideas from europe and elsewhere on how to change public services .
shadow cabinet members are being despatched to other countries " to see why it is that their public services are so much better than ours " .
mr duncan smith did not shy away from criticising the government , accusing it of putting preservation of the status quo and protection of vested interests ahead of patients and parents .
gordon brown 's management of the economy also came under fire and he referred to the " hubris " of those who believed boom and bust had been abolished .
but officials said mr duncan smith deliberately chose a muted tone , avoiding gratuitous party point scoring against the backdrop of military action .
' cynical cult ' that action began on the eve of the conference , forcing mr duncan smith to return to parliament on monday for the emergency commons debate .
as he spoke about the international situation , the tory leader turned his fire on osama bin laden , the prime suspect for the us terror attacks .
mr duncan smith said : " bin laden claims to speak for islam , but he can not .
" his is a cynical and suicidal cult dedicated to the destruction of civilisations and lives , irrespective of their faith .
" this is a man who sends young acolytes to die for his own pathological purpose , while he himself skulks in caves .

" we are the fourth richest country on earth .
we should be providing public services that match those of our european neighbours not those of the third world . "
he said tory governments of the 1980s and early 1990s addressed the uk 's economic failures and now attention had to switch to insecurity , economic instability and improving public services .
bin laden claims to speak for islam , but he can not iain duncan smith in a reference to the ongoing labour party debate over using private firms to deliver public services , mr duncan smith argued : " our european neighbours simply enjoy better hospitals , because they put the needs of their people before the demands of dogma .
" if we are to live up to the demands of a new century we must do the same .
" that is our greatest mission at home over the coming years : to assemble the coalition of charities and churches , the public and private sectors that will deliver results . "
his party will have an open mind on public service reform , the conservative leader promised , but will also use the " best of british innovation , enterprise and energy " .
euro opposition mr duncan smith also restated his opposition to joining the euro and drew on nato 's role in the current action against terrorism to criticise the " european army " proposals as " dangerous " .
but there was also a move to show he is not generally anti-european as he outlined plans to draw ideas from europe and elsewhere on how to change public services .
shadow cabinet members are being despatched to other countries " to see why it is that their public services are so much better than ours " .
mr duncan smith did not shy away from criticising the government , accusing it of putting preservation of the status quo and protection of vested interests ahead of patients and parents .
gordon brown 's management of the economy also came under fire and he referred to the " hubris " of those who believed boom and bust had been abolished .
but officials said mr duncan smith deliberately chose a muted tone , avoiding gratuitous party point scoring against the backdrop of military action .
' cynical cult ' that action began on the eve of the conference , forcing mr duncan smith to return to parliament on monday for the emergency commons debate .
as he spoke about the international situation , the tory leader turned his fire on osama bin laden , the prime suspect for the us terror attacks .
mr duncan smith said : " bin laden claims to speak for islam , but he can not .
" his is a cynical and suicidal cult dedicated to the destruction of civilisations and lives , irrespective of their faith .
" this is a man who sends young acolytes to die for his own pathological purpose , while he himself skulks in caves . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's john pienaar " the speech pleased the party faithful " news and analysis see also : 09 oct 01 -pipe- conservatives tories bid for public service credentials 08 oct 01 -pipe- conservatives davis rules out women 's quotas 08 oct 01 -pipe- conservatives the show goes on , vow tories 10 oct 01 -pipe- uk politics ids : man with a mission 10 oct 01 -pipe- uk politics iain duncan smith speech in full internet links : conservative party the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites e-mail this story to a friend ^ ^ back to top news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes - to bbc sport > > -pipe- to bbc weather > > -pipe- to bbc world service > > - © mmiii -pipe- news sources -pipe- privacy

the worst killings took place in a village in the southern province of cauca river valley , where paramilitaries of the united self-defence forces of colombia -lrb- auc -rrb- shot dead at least 17 men .
this could really be the end of the negotiation process eduardo cifuentes human rights ombudsman in santa marta , on the caribbean coast , the bodies of six kidnapped fishermen were discovered , all of them with gunshot wounds .

the paramilitary auc had previously killed civilians whom they suspected of aiding leftist rebels who have been waging a 37-year war against the colombian state .

colombian government forces have been fighting both leftist guerrillas , such as the farc , and right-wing paramilitaries , for decades in the country 's civil war .
the government has been negotiating with the farc since late 1998 to end the violence , but the talks have failed to yield any substantial results .
so far this year over 1,000 people have been murdered by paramilitary death squads .

a san francisco court ruled that a summary judgment , bringing the two-year-old copyright case to a rapid end , would be premature .
this spares napster at least temporarily from what is likely to be a multi-million-dollar bill for unpaid royalties .
the music industry argued that napster 's online technology facilitated wholesale copyright infringement .
but judge marilyn hall patel decided that there was not yet enough evidence to justify the summary judgement .
' looks bad ' judge patel also heavily criticised some of the record companies behind the lawsuit , saying they could abuse their positions of dominance with their own planned music download services .
one of the services , musicnet , had hallmarks of an anti-competitive business enterprise that " looks bad , sounds bad and smells bad , " she said .
because the major labels were working together in forming musicnet and pressplay , they could set price controls to limit the marketplace .
this would give napster little option but to sign deals with them when it relaunched as a legitimate service , napster 's lawyer celia barenholtz said .
napster is hoping that the argument could provide a defence and let them escape prosecution .
the recording giants say such arguments amount to little more than playing for time .
" the tactic napster has taken is to throw everything up against the wall in order to stall a summary judgement , " said russell frackman , a lawyer for the record labels .
but copyright ownership and the way recording contracts work are factors that will be looked at more closely as the case moves ahead .
' market manipulation ' the judge ordered the two sides to appoint a " special master " to work through documents detailing artists ' and record labels ' rights over songs .
ms barenholtz said record companies had a " long history " of copyright abuse , price-fixing and market manipulation .
" if it comes down to a way of measuring dirty hands , we have a right to discovery to see how dirty their hands are , " she said .
napster 's service has been idle since july .
the firm is planning to launch a new , legal version before the end of the year that will charge users for access to music files .

police should prove their case in court pas youth leader mahfuz omar the men , five of whom are teachers in religious schools , are accused of involvement with the malaysian mujahideen group -lrb- kmm -rrb- .
they were arrested on wednesday under malaysia 's internal security law -lrb- isa -rrb- , which allows detention without trial .
a police spokesman said the men were suspected of activities that threatened national security .
but a senior member of the parti islam se-malaysia -lrb- pas -rrb- said on thursday the arrests were " ridiculous " .
' political ploy ' pas youth leader mahfuz omar said : " if the police really want to prove their case against the detainees , they should produce them in open court . "
" otherwise , this is nothing but a political ploy , " he said .
another pas official , mohd hatta ramli , told the reuters news agency : " we have heard about 23 countries having arrested people connected to terrorism and i 'm sure malaysia wants to be seen as one of those , and at this point in time , i think that 's what the government is doing . "
complex stance malaysia has pledged support to us investigations into the 11 september attacks on new york and washington but has criticised the us attacks on afghanistan because it says innocent people would be killed and terrorism would not be wiped out .

pas on wednesday called for malaysian to be allowed to travel to afghanistan to show solidarity against the us-led strikes .
it called for a jihad in terms of aid , financial support and prayers , but stopped short of encouraging people to fight kmm crackdown the malaysian authorities have blamed the kmm group for a series of crimes including bank thefts , an assassination and the bombing of a church and a temple .
ten alleged kmm members , including nik adli nik aziz , the son of the spiritual leader of pas , nik abdul aziz nik mat , have now been detained since august .
nine , including mr adli have been ordered detained without trial for two years under the isa .
critics complain that by using the isa , the malaysian government avoids having to produce any evidence in court the government argues the isa is crucial to containing extremist groups .

the study - conducted over an 18-month period by the commission on black staff in further education - said ethnic minority staff were often marginalised and their claims of racial discrimination not taken seriously .
it showed that fewer than 5 % of colleges surveyed had a race equality policy and only 16 % had a senior black or asian staff member .
the commission , established in 1999 following the macpherson report into the death of stephen lawrence , took evidence from both expert witnesses and minority ethnic staff .
josephine ocloo said problems must be acknowledged its project director , josephine ocloo , said their study had shown what the macpherson report termed " institutional racism " was rife in colleges .
" generally , there is a lack of acceptance that there is a problem , still less an understanding of how to deal with it systematically .
" as a result , complaints of discrimination , racial stereotyping , and racist incidents may be ignored , with black staff left feeling frightened , frustrated and under-valued , " ms ocloo said .
' ghettoised ' the commission 's research revealed that ethnic minority staff were often not represented at all in colleges or concentrated at the lower grades on part-time and temporary contracts .
black and asian staff were largely excluded from the decision making process and were ghettoised into certain subject areas such as " ethnic issues " the report said .
but the commission 's chairman , mike peters , said there was evidence for hope of improvement .
mr peters pointed to the fact that several key organisations such as the association of colleges and the university and college lecturers ' union , natfhe , had sponsored their work .
" this demonstrates that the sector is prepared to take these issues seriously and to find their own internal solutions to the problems , " he said .
the commission 's final report next year is expected to present key findings and put forward proposals to encourage the recruitment , retention and promotion of ethnic minority staff .

the 38-year-old lecturer who now works at an east london college has been in teaching for more than 10 years .
mr ashan said in spite of his former college being in a very multi-racial area few of the staff were from ethnic minorities and he was the only black person in his department .
equality was not discussed or considered an issue that should be raised or taken seriously , he added .
two members of my student body who were card-carrying members of the bnp were actively encouraged to give me as much trouble as they could in class mannish lall norfolk lecturer " i remember clearly around the time of the stephen lawrence report i spoke to managers about setting up a black staff group .
" that would have been helpful in looking at staff recruitment and selection procedures because none of the managers were from ethnic minority and yet the majority of students were , " he said .
mr ashan said he also suggested altering the curriculum to reflect the multi-racial student body but said his proposals fell on " deaf ears " .
he added he felt his career suffered as a result of his attempts to make managers more aware of equality issues and he finally left after his job description was changed , effectively down-grading him .
" they even went so far as to get a white member of staff in , a new appointment , to do the job i was supposed to do .
so it was quite clear i was n't wanted there , " mr ashan said .
' undermined ' a norfolk lecturer , mannish lall , said he too had been virtually forced out of his job by racist attitudes .
mr lall said that during his time as head of media studies at a norfolk college students were encouraged to harass him .
" i found out later that two members of my student body who were card-carrying members of the bnp were actively encouraged to give me as much trouble as they could in class .
" they said things like " niggers should all be chopped up " and " all pakis should be sent home " .
equality issues have been pushed lower down the agenda peter ashan mr lall said he had been told that his job - which he held on a six month contract - would not be made permanent due to a shortage of funds .
he later discovered the college had re-advertised it as a permanent position , he added , but did not apply as he felt he had been constantly undermined by his line manager .
" the implied message was " you are asian , you are no good , you have no chance " .
" it was the tone , the facial expression - i was n't called a paki or whatever as i know has happened to some people in my profession - he was n't that upfront about it . "
both mr lall and peter ashan hoped that as a result of the report by the commission for black staff in further education more importance would be attached to equality issues .
mr ashan said : " equality issues have been pushed lower down the agenda which is wrong .
" i hope the report will mean we will see a real concern to ensure that colleges reflect the diversity of the communities they serve . "

" our country has been completely destroyed .
i do n't care who 's responsible .
but when the americans decided to attack , i was overcome by sadness .
i hope all the enemies of afghanistan will be destroyed . "
fatemeh is one of more than 200,000 refugees who have flooded into the iranian town of zahedan over the years of upheaval in afghanistan .
hardly any of them live in camps .
instead , they 've swamped iranian towns and cities , often living in squalid conditions , and putting extra pressure on already scarce resources - especially jobs , and also water , in an area that 's been hit by drought for three years running .
official estimates say there are more than 2.3 million refugees .
many of them have fled since the taleban took over most of afghanistan in 1995 .
condemnation many are from the afghan shia minority , the hazara , which has been heavily persecuted by the fanatically sunni and exclusively pashtun taleban .
yet among the refugees in zahedan , it was hard to find anyone who was enthusiastic about the american and british attacks .
" they want to destroy islam , they do n't want islam to flourish , " said one man .
if they really want to hit the terrorists , they could find some other way afghan refugee " if they really want to hit the terrorists , they could find some other way , " said another .
" they 're destroying the people .
they 're not just against afghanistan , they 're against islam . "
many of the refugees blame the us for helping install the taleban in the first place .
" osama bin laden was the number one american spy , along with the taleban , " said one .
" i 'm happy because we see that those who started up the taleban - the americans , saudi arabia , pakistan - are those who were hit by them , and it 's them who are now having to go after the taleban , " said an unemployed former teacher from kabul .
having suffered at the hands of the taleban , such people might be expected to welcome action against them .
' no solution ' but many fear the attacks may not bring a solution , only more bloodshed and destruction .
they are also suspicious and cynical about american intentions .
the same sentiments are shared by the refugees ' iranian hosts .
despite differences in tone , reformists and hard-liners are agreed on the main lines of national reaction to the crisis : condemnation of the 11 september attacks on america , but condemnation also of the strikes against afghanistan .
iran is fiercely hostile to the taleban , who emerged from a strain of fundamentalist sunni islam which regards shiism as close to heresy .
the two countries nearly went to war three years ago , after 10 iranian diplomats were killed by the taleban .
but iranian leaders have criticised the us-led onslaught on the grounds that innocent civilians will be the victims , that it may cause further waves of refugees , and that muslim sentiment risks being outraged .
they also accuse the us of cloaking strategic ambitions for expanded regional influence behind their supposed drive against terrorism .
iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamene 'i , has taken the lead in denouncing the americans in harsh terms .
his word is final , and he laid it down at an emergency meeting of the country 's supreme national security council on 25 september .
powerful neighbour since then , even the mild-mannered reformist president , mohammad khatami , has personally criticised president george w bush , accusing him of falling prey to the arrogance of power by insisting that all countries must be either with washington or with " the terrorists " .
" we are with neither , " mr khatami said .
he has also called for an immediate halt to the strikes on afghanistan , arguing that innocent people are paying the price for atrocities committed elsewhere .
some reformists - but by no means all - had hoped the crisis would offer a chance for a rapid breakthrough in relations with the us .
but any such hope was brusquely slapped down by the leader .
if there is to be a rapprochement , it will not come quickly and easily .
one route might be the effort to find a political accommodation in afghanistan should the taleban fall .
iran 's cooperation , as a powerful neighbour with strong influence within the afghan opposition , would be important .
" one problem is , we do n't know what the americans want to do in afghanistan , " said one leading reformist .
" but we do n't think it will solve the country 's crisis . "

they also accuse the us of cloaking strategic ambitions for expanded regional influence behind their supposed drive against terrorism .
iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamene 'i , has taken the lead in denouncing the americans in harsh terms .
his word is final , and he laid it down at an emergency meeting of the country 's supreme national security council on 25 september .
powerful neighbour since then , even the mild-mannered reformist president , mohammad khatami , has personally criticised president george w bush , accusing him of falling prey to the arrogance of power by insisting that all countries must be either with washington or with " the terrorists " .
" we are with neither , " mr khatami said .
president khatami has called for an end to the air strikes he has also called for an immediate halt to the strikes on afghanistan , arguing that innocent people are paying the price for atrocities committed elsewhere .
some reformists - but by no means all - had hoped the crisis would offer a chance for a rapid breakthrough in relations with the us .
but any such hope was brusquely slapped down by the leader .
if there is to be a rapprochement , it will not come quickly and easily .
one route might be the effort to find a political accommodation in afghanistan should the taleban fall .
iran 's cooperation , as a powerful neighbour with strong influence within the afghan opposition , would be important .
" one problem is , we do n't know what the americans want to do in afghanistan , " said one leading reformist .
" but we do n't think it will solve the country 's crisis . "
