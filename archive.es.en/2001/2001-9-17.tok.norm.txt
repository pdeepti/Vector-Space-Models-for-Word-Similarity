the breakthrough in china 's 15-year membership negotiations came late on friday night , after a session which had been postponed because of the air attacks on new york .
the signing in geneva will open the door for taiwan 's application for wto membership to receive the same approval , as soon as tuesday .
chen ruey-long , taiwan 's vice minister for economic affairs , said the working group overseeing of the two accession contracts will screen taiwan 's application on 18 september .
equal footing beijing views taiwan as a rebel province and its government as secessionist .
the rivals will have equal rights and status within the wto , unlike in many other international bodies .
nonetheless , analysts say the balance of forces inside the wto will be irrevocably changed by the entry of china , the world 's fifth largest trading power after the us , the european union , japan and canada .
western nations have been hoping china 's membership - and the tariff cuts beijing has agreed to bring it about - will bring a boost to the world economy .
china enjoyed double digit economic growth during much of the last decade and growth this year is forecast at about 7 % , twice that of most industrialised countries .
boosting growth data released on monday showed china 's government has moved to protect its economy from the risk of global economic slowdown .
investment in fixed assets was worth 220bn yuan in august , a jump of 21.4 % year-on-year , the state statistical bureau said .
" growth of fixed asset investment in infrastructure , technical upgrading and real estate has all accelerated , " the bureau said .
western china , which is the focus of a central government development drive , had greater increases than the coastal provinces .
in the first eight months of this year , investment in fixed assets rose 18.9 % to 1,330bn yen -lrb- $ 161bn -rrb- , with the biggest increases in spending on infrastructure and property final obstacles after the entry package is signed on monday , it will be rubber-stamped by a meeting of the wto general council , due in mid-october .

the breakthrough in china 's 15-year membership negotiations came late on friday night , after a session which had been postponed because of the air attacks on new york .

china 's negotiator agreed to postpone talks after us disasters the rivals will have equal rights and status within the wto , unlike in many other international bodies .
nonetheless , analysts say the balance of forces inside the wto will be irrevocably changed by the entry of china , the world 's fifth largest trading power after the us , the european union , japan and canada .
western nations have been hoping china 's membership - and the tariff cuts beijing has agreed to bring it about - will bring a boost to the world economy .

in the first eight months of this year , investment in fixed assets rose 18.9 % to 1,330bn yen -lrb- $ 161bn -rrb- , with the biggest increases in spending on infrastructure and property final obstacles after the entry package is signed on monday , it will be rubber-stamped by a meeting of the wto general council , due in mid-october .

airlines worldwide have been badly hit by the impact of tuesday 's tragic events , with us carrier continental cutting 25 % of its flights and giving 12,000 staff a leave of absence .
british airways has introduced a recruitment freeze as it faces increased costs for security , lower demand for flights and the knock-on effect of cancelled flights in recent days .
last year ba 's transatlantic operations accounted for more than a third of its £ 9.3 billion revenue .
it is too soon to be talking about any detailed impact on our business ba spokeswoman in the wake of the attacks ba saw its share price dip to 165p - earlier in the year shares had been trading as high as 463p .
earlier in the year ba announced 1,800 job cuts from its 62,000 global workforce .
unions had already been expecting around another 2,000 job losses but now fear the final figure will be much higher .
and a report in the sunday business estimated that the firm could shed 6,000 jobs .
a ba spokeswoman said it was too soon to be talking in detail about the effect the us attacks would have .
" obviously under the circumstances and as a responsible company there are things we are doing such as tightly managing our expenditure .
" but it is important to be calm and considered , to make sure the business gets through okay , " she said .
review virgin airways and british midland have both said they are monitoring the situation but stressed job cuts were not currently being considered .
virgin said a review has been ongoing since the attacks , but that no decisions had yet been taken .
a spokesman for british midland said : " we 've not noticed a dramatic change in flight traffic on our -lrb- non-us -rrb- flights since the tragedy . "
he said passengers had been offered refunds on flights since tuesday but there had been a " very small " uptake .
" we carry a lot of business passengers and i expect it will be the leisure industry that is worst hit in the short term . "
analysts believe that any long-term changes in security measures at airports could hit budget carriers , which rely on a quick turn-around of passengers to keep costs low .

the chances of that happening have increased markedly because of the destruction of the world trade center .

william grant and sons , makers of the popular single malt glenfiddich , has teamed up with edinburgh-based caledonian brewery to produce a whisky that has been matured in old beer casks .
ale cask reserve is a blended whisky that has been kept for several months in barrels which used to hold edinburgh strong ale .
william grant hopes that the new product will be a big hit with whisky drinkers but industry analysts think that it may only have a limited appeal with the younger generation .
the quality of whisky all depends on the quality of wood in which it is matured charles maclean , whisky expert both partner companies have said that this is the first time whisky has been successfully matured in beer casks and they will be seeking a patent for the process .
caledonian brewery managing director russell sharp said : " this is a world first .
we believe a number of people have tried to make this work and they have n't managed to do it .
" it is the first time that whisky has been successfully matured in a beer barrel . "
mr sharp said it was not " a simple matter of putting whisky into an old beer barrel " .
' distinctive taste ' he added : " the beer itself has been brewed in a very innovative way and that has actually produced the desired flavours . "
grant 's blended whisky is placed in old beer barrels at its warehouse in girvan , ayrshire , for several months before being bottled .
the spirit is said to take on a subtle hops smell and flavour , in much the same way as malts do from sherry casks .
the whisky is bottled after months in ale casks grant 's chief chemist mike webber said : " while there has been finishes in the malt industry with malt whiskies , it 's never been done with the blended whiskies . "
he described the flavour of the new ale cask reserve as " distinctive " and said it " actually works " .
both firms believe the product 's unique characteristics will make it a success but whisky analysts are less convinced .
writer and editor , charles maclean , who reviews different brand for whisky magazines , believes finishing a blend in ale casks may appeal to young people .
but he says that older people and whisky connoisseurs are likely to shy away from any radical departure from tradition .
it is the first time that whisky has been successfully matured in a beer barrel .
russell sharp , caledonian brewery " i would not be alone , among many so-called experts , in believing that in many cases , the original without the finishing is better .
" the quality of whisky all depends on the quality of wood in which it is matured . "
mr maclean said that putting the new blend in casks for a short time only might " introduce aromas which do n't necessarily cohere " .
william grant is hoping to convince drinkers that ale cask reserve is a winning product and will begin a major marketing campaign when the blend has its world-wide launch in london on 25 september . watch / listen on this story morag kinniburgh reports " the spirit takes on a subtle hops colour and flavour .

the independent television commission -lrb- itc -rrb- said that richard bacon 's comments during a newspaper review breached its code .
bacon made jokes about poor memory after a news item about a new vaccine for the dementia-causing illness .
viewers complained to the itc and to the television channel after the remarks on a 7 june show .
channel 4 apologised and is taking the matter up with the programme makers .
the itc rules provide for the possibility of offending viewers with humorous remarks even if there is no malice involved .
distress earlier this month channel 4 had to apologise on air for a satirical documentary on paedophilia , brass eye .
at the time the itc said that the scenes involving children in a sexual context had generated " offence and distress " .
that show included mock tv news reports into suspected paedophiles , their behaviour , and how the public should take measures to keep their children safe .
the commission cleared reality show survivor after complaints about scenes of rats being drowned , as they were thought to be editorially justified .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- autumn flood warning renewed categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 17 september , 2001 , 07:43 gmt 08:43 uk autumn flood warning renewed floods affected hundreds of towns and villages last year householders will be warned about the risk of flooding this autumn in an environment agency campaign to be launched on monday .
the move comes after research suggested nearly half of people living in flood zones did not know they were at risk .
the environment agency 's awareness campaign will use television and newspaper advertisements and direct mailing , urging people to " wise up " to flooding .
i think last year 's floods were a wake up call after too many people had hit the snooze button sir john harman environment agency september marks the start of the winter flood season , and if water levels rise again this year , up to five million people in england and wales could be affected .
the first risk is expected almost immediately , especially in coastal areas , as high tides are predicted during the coming week .
last autumn saw the heaviest rainfall since records began .
hundreds of homes across the uk were ruined as rivers burst their banks and storms and gales lashed the countryside .
' devastating effect ' recurring heavy downpours caused prolonged , extensive and repeated flooding in some areas .
in the london area some 325 properties were reported to have flooded during october and november 2000 .
hundreds of homes were evacuated in york the south west , north west , midlands , home counties , and parts of yorkshire and the north east were also badly affected .
environment agency chairman sir john harman denied not enough was being done to tackle the flood threat .
sir john told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " the money that is put in place for flood defences is not decided by the agency - it is decided by a mixture of government grant and local authority decisions . "
he said climate changes could be one way of explaining the rapidity of last year 's increased flooding .
global warming " we are very concerned about the way the climate is changing .
" we saw last winter - who knows whether it is directly connected with global warming - but it seems to be consistent with this .
" we are getting periods of much heavier sharper rainfall . "
sir john said it was important for homeowners to understand the risks and ways to minimise damage .
" there is still too much complacency about .
i think last year 's floods were a wake up call after too many people had hit the snooze button .
huge shock " there will come a height of flood that will overwhelm even the best flood defences .
" it is a huge shock to be flooded but the worse thing is the length of time it takes to get back into your home . "
the campaign has been welcomed by the association of british insurers , although director general mary francis called on the government to take action to prevent flooding .
" for the immediate future , insurers have promised to continue providing home owners and small businesses with flood cover , where at all possible , " she said .
" but , over the longer term , the affordability and availability of insurance will depend on action being taken now by the government and other public bodies to reduce risks . "
sandbag defence celebrity chef antony worrall thompson is supporting the environment agency campaign .
mr worrall thompson lives with his wife and two children in shiplake-on-thames , oxfordshire , and his home was flooded between october to april .
he was shown on the bbc 's food and drink programme stuffing tights with sand to make sandbags to protect his home .
he said : " i remember we had to use a canoe tied to the house to get down to the garden shed . "
the environment agency 's 24-hour hotline and website will advise people on how to prepare for floods .

bbc news -pipe- south asian -pipe- are women intimidated for political gain ?
categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : talking point : debates : south asian front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 17 september , 2001 , 08:24 gmt 09:24 uk are women intimidated for political gain ?
a militant group in kashmir has issued an ultimatum for women to wear the full islamic veil , or " burqa " , when they are in public .
at the moment most kashmiri women do n't wear the full veil .
but last month , there was an acid attack on two women in srinagar who were not covering their faces .
hardline muslim groups in other parts of india have also tried to coerce or persuade women to wear the veil .
but other political and religious groups have condemned the use of overt threats and violence which , they argue , are not condoned by the islamic religion .
should women take notice of such threats ?
how can intimidation be tackled ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction islam does n't say to abuse women or throw acids on the face .
islam only says to wear dresses that do not show one 's beauty to others .
so burqa is not the only solution , islam does n't say to cover women 's faces .
all muslim women know that 's how to be a good muslim , so it should n't be imposed by threats .
shakil ahmed , uk / pakistan the west especially wants to strip its women of their dress whereas islam wants to maintain the dignity of its women by covering their body parts .
wearing a veil reflects a higher level of faith , where the women folk are trying to hide their faces from strangers so that they do not get attracted by their looks .
ps look at the pictures you draw of mary and jesus and you will see how modestly they are dressed .
shoaib khalid , usa this is plain old terrorism .
the fact that the dress code has to be enforced shows how unpopular it really is among women .
it is sad that the menfolk remain silent - maybe they need the burqa .
b. singh , usa this appears to be just another scare tactic being employed by a group of people for political gain jay , usa this appears to be just another scare tactic being employed by a group of people for political gain .
although there is no religious basis for this demand , the offenders are trying to disguise it under the veil of religion .
those who support such acts are neither muslim , nor of any other religion .
they are inhuman and should be dealt with accordingly .
it is only when we become responsible for our actions that we endeavour to change them .
jay , usa addressing peter augustine 's comments here , i am wondering what religion he converted from and if that religion advocated any less peace and simplicity and required that men and women should be treated unequally ?
peace , simplicity and equal treatment of men and women are not the exclusive virtues of islam .
on the contrary , most of the abuse of women is predominant with practitioners of this religion .
if all of them are simply branded as not ' true ' islamists , i fail to see what his point is as by the same count , no evil doer is a ' true ' adherent of his or her religion .
ashok , australia confusion reigns not only amongst the people wanting the ' burqa ' to be mandatory , but also between the readers in this forum .
religious leaders from each country should decide whether the burqa ' has ' to be worn , or ' can ' be worn .
once conveyed to the public , women will be not be used as a means to attain media and political attention .
a. bukhari , uk people should be moving forward , not back to the dark ages bk , england i think it is a shame that women in islam are forced to be covered from head to toe .
it is possible to be decently dressed in western and asian attire .
it does n't say anywhere in the quran that women should be covered from head to toe .
people should be moving forward , not back to the dark ages .
bk , england in response to ahmed , uk , i should point out that in saudi arabia the incidence of rapes may be the lowest reported , but this may say more about the criminal justice system than the incidence of rape .
jez humble , uk i strongly disagree with ahmed .
wearing a burqa is not the way to bring down rape figures in saudi .
good policing only brings down crimes .
we should respect others ' rights , particularly the weaker section of the community .
viji palaniappan , usa / india what islamists do in their own country is up to them ... though one trusts it is illegal to throw acid in the face of anyone anywhere in the world .
however , to respond to rebekha , england , it is right that civilised countries ban the forcible belittling of girls by ignorant minds who force them to wear the burqa .
we have outgrown such barbarism .
if adult women desire to wear it , so be it ... but do n't force it on young children in a free society .
mark m. newdick , usa / uk islam has ordered its women to dress in a certain way bashir a. hassan , somalian in usa i do not understand why people are so concerned about the religion / culture or dress code of a society .
islam has ordered its women to dress in a certain way and islam is a religion of choice .
so if a woman chooses to be a muslim and dress in accordance with the quran , it should be accepted and respected by everybody .
bashir a. hassan , somalian in usa women are victims of religious crime on all sides .
whether it is the forcing of the burqa in muslim communities or the practice of female infanticide and widow-burning in hindu ones .
the way forward is education , not criticism .
bilal patel , london , uk i recently converted to islam because of its peacefulness , simplicity and the equality it shows towards men and women .
the prophet muhammad has long given women rights that the western world just gave them in the 20th century .
these include the right to own property , request divorce and the right to earn .
stories like these ' hardliners ' disturb me since they have nothing to do with the religion of islam , rather a system of control over women .
peter augustine , birmingham , uk comparing dress codes is useless if you do n't compare the enforcement of them ls , uk / australia / usa do women have more freedom whether or not they 're forced to wear veils ?
of course not !
in the us or uk , the female dress code is enforced by arts and culture .
disobey and you get laughed at .
in iran , it 's enforced by the police .
disobey and you get flogged .
in pakistan , it 's enforced by a combination of family and courts .
disobey and your father knows he wo n't be punished for killing you .
comparing dress codes is useless if you do n't compare the enforcement of them .
ls , uk / australia / usa it is certainly a part of islamic law that a woman cover her face , as is reported from authentic narrations -lrb- ahadith -rrb- .
where scholars differ is whether it is mandatory or recommended .
throwing acid in a woman 's face is a criminal act and there is no justification for it .
islam has to be in the heart before it can manifest itself on people 's limbs .
ahmad sajjad , australia there has been a suggestion to make burqa mandatory in the west to bring down cases of rape .
i would like to ask my friend that in the countries he is quoting as example , how many cases see the light of day ? ?
can we be sure that the voice of women is not stifled in the name of culture , religion or tradition .
the choice to dress as one pleases is a natural and fundamental right of freedom and no fundamentalist , terrorist or religious fanatic should be given the right to infringe on others ' rights .
abhay , india this practice is against the teachings of islam and must be stopped sajjad anwar , usa the quran , the holy book of the muslims has not ordered any full veil or burqa for women .
the instructions are for both men and women to wear decent clothes which are not provocative .
clearly the hard-liners and religiously orthodox leaders have introduced this system into islam and society in order to enslave women .
this practice is against the teachings of islam and must be stopped .
sajjad anwar , usa there is no such coercion in islam about a burqa or covering one 's face .
and muslims are well aware of this fact .
this act of throwing acid is committed by a little known group that claims to be ' islamist ' .
ayesha , usa who commits the greater crime in the eyes of god , the woman who does not wear a veil or the psychopath who beats her up or throws acid in her face ?
it is what it is , an excuse for evil men to abuse women .
mick b , uk i would like to draw people 's attention to the fact that in france the wearing of the veil at school and in public places was made illegal , so is that not a violation of human rights ?
rebekha , england i am in support of the burqa ahmed , uk i am in support of the burqa , although the full burqa is not islamic it is an innovation .
saudi arabia has the lowest cases of raped women in the world , the least number of abused women and most importantly there are very few abused children .
contrary to popular belief women are not protected in the west , they are exploited under the banner of " arts and culture " .
if the us / uk were to implement a burqa system would the number of women being raped increased / decrease ?
it does n't take a genius to work out the answer .
ahmed , uk islamic clerics and other so-called religious leaders use all these tactics to maintain their hold on the population .
while pakistan justifies this in the name of religion , india has n't done much to discourage it because of vote bank politics .
the so-called secular political parties in india have a lot to answer for by not freeing the muslim women from the mullahs .
ashesh , usa while it may be accepted in muslim society to wear the veil , it should not be forced upon those who do n't see the need to cover up .
moderate muslims should speak up against these extremist groups who have a strange and bizarre interpretation of islam .
with pakistan already on the cusp of being talebenised , the same ruthless behaviour is now raising its ugly head in formerly peaceful kashmir .
what joy and happiness has the taleban brought to anyone ?
a. rastogi , india this is just another way to oppress women dhirendra , india this is just another way to oppress women and put them in a subordinate place in society .
a woman should enjoy the same human rights as those guaranteed under international human rights legislation .
dhirendra , india the qur 'an says : " there is no compulsion in religion . "
the kashmiri group 's declaration is completely un-islamic .
at the same time , it highlights the plight of the kashmiri people who are not well educated in their religion .
it also highlights the oppression of the indian government that prevents them from learning islam .
i really do n't know whether they can be blamed for their ignorance .
kamran kiyani , usa it 's just a plea to all muslims all over the world that human rights are not only for men but for women too .
tj , india i believe there is a nasty agenda by terrorists in this misadventure shyam koppikar , usa the muslim fanatics / terrorists in kashmir are deliberately forcing the women to wear the veil .
surprisingly certain muslim organisations support this .
i believe there is a nasty agenda by terrorists in this misadventure .
once all women are veiled , there is no way of telling if the veiled person is man or woman or whether he / she is carrying guns .
shyam koppikar , usa women or men should be allowed to practice what they believe in .
if the women in kashmir do n't believe in wearing a " burqa " in public , it should not be imposed on them .
it 's against human rights .
ranjeeta , england such intimidation can only be tackled if peaceful muslims speak out against such tactics and if women receive the protection from the police that they deserve .
after all , whatever your political objectives as a muslim , there can be no justification at all for the sort of cowardly and repressive tactics used against women .
it is absolutely disgraceful and uncivilised .

can we be sure that the voice of women is not stifled in the name of culture , religion or tradition .
the choice to dress as one pleases is a natural and fundamental right of freedom and no fundamentalist , terrorist or religious fanatic should be given the right to infringe on others ' rights .
abhay , india this practice is against the teachings of islam and must be stopped sajjad anwar , usa the quran , the holy book of the muslims has not ordered any full veil or burqa for women .
the instructions are for both men and women to wear decent clothes which are not provocative .
clearly the hard-liners and religiously orthodox leaders have introduced this system into islam and society in order to enslave women .
this practice is against the teachings of islam and must be stopped .
sajjad anwar , usa there is no such coercion in islam about a burqa or covering one 's face .
and muslims are well aware of this fact .
this act of throwing acid is committed by a little known group that claims to be ' islamist ' .
ayesha , usa who commits the greater crime in the eyes of god , the woman who does not wear a veil or the psychopath who beats her up or throws acid in her face ?
it is what it is , an excuse for evil men to abuse women .
mick b , uk i would like to draw people 's attention to the fact that in france the wearing of the veil at school and in public places was made illegal , so is that not a violation of human rights ?
rebekha , england i am in support of the burqa ahmed , uk i am in support of the burqa , although the full burqa is not islamic it is an innovation .
saudi arabia has the lowest cases of raped women in the world , the least number of abused women and most importantly there are very few abused children .
contrary to popular belief women are not protected in the west , they are exploited under the banner of " arts and culture " .
if the us / uk were to implement a burqa system would the number of women being raped increased / decrease ?
it does n't take a genius to work out the answer .
ahmed , uk islamic clerics and other so-called religious leaders use all these tactics to maintain their hold on the population .
while pakistan justifies this in the name of religion , india has n't done much to discourage it because of vote bank politics .
the so-called secular political parties in india have a lot to answer for by not freeing the muslim women from the mullahs .
ashesh , usa while it may be accepted in muslim society to wear the veil , it should not be forced upon those who do n't see the need to cover up .
moderate muslims should speak up against these extremist groups who have a strange and bizarre interpretation of islam .
with pakistan already on the cusp of being talebenised , the same ruthless behaviour is now raising its ugly head in formerly peaceful kashmir .
what joy and happiness has the taleban brought to anyone ?
a. rastogi , india this is just another way to oppress women dhirendra , india this is just another way to oppress women and put them in a subordinate place in society .
a woman should enjoy the same human rights as those guaranteed under international human rights legislation .
dhirendra , india the qur 'an says : " there is no compulsion in religion . "
the kashmiri group 's declaration is completely un-islamic .
at the same time , it highlights the plight of the kashmiri people who are not well educated in their religion .
it also highlights the oppression of the indian government that prevents them from learning islam .
i really do n't know whether they can be blamed for their ignorance .
kamran kiyani , usa it 's just a plea to all muslims all over the world that human rights are not only for men but for women too .
tj , india i believe there is a nasty agenda by terrorists in this misadventure shyam koppikar , usa the muslim fanatics / terrorists in kashmir are deliberately forcing the women to wear the veil .
surprisingly certain muslim organisations support this .
i believe there is a nasty agenda by terrorists in this misadventure .
once all women are veiled , there is no way of telling if the veiled person is man or woman or whether he / she is carrying guns .
shyam koppikar , usa women or men should be allowed to practice what they believe in .
if the women in kashmir do n't believe in wearing a " burqa " in public , it should not be imposed on them .
it 's against human rights .
ranjeeta , england such intimidation can only be tackled if peaceful muslims speak out against such tactics and if women receive the protection from the police that they deserve .
after all , whatever your political objectives as a muslim , there can be no justification at all for the sort of cowardly and repressive tactics used against women .
it is absolutely disgraceful and uncivilised .

he said the protest " still needs to go on until we have got the safety issues dealt with " .
' broker agreement ' the residents said they would continue to meet officials from the northern ireland office , who have been trying to broker an agreement between the protestant and catholic residents , under the direction of northern ireland secretary john reid .

the short service was led by parish priest father aidan troy before the group made its way to the school .
father troy said the people of the area wanted to show their solidarity with the victims of the new york and washington attacks .
last week , exploratory talks between representatives of loyalist protesters and the board of governors at the school took place .
the dispute started in june , but a series of attempts to start talks between the two groups over the summer broke up in mutual recrimination .

but amid the gloom , they were told that there was cause for hope .
faith has always been a natural retreat for those who are grieving and on sunday evening st patrick 's cathedral in manhattan became the focal point for thousands of mourners .
those who could n't get a pew listened outside some had queued for up to five hours to be sure of getting a pew inside the church , where a special service had been scheduled to commemorate the victims of tuesday 's terror attack .
but such is the strength of feeling in new york that by the time the service got underway , those who did make it through the cathedral doors were heavily outnumbered by the crowd outside .
for two hours , the stretch of up-market fifth avenue that st patrick 's fronts onto became an extension of the church .
crash barriers were erected to contain the crowd and loudspeakers carried the prayers of cardinal edward egan to the street .
the cathedral stands amid manhattan 's skyscrapers at the south end of fifth , in the distance but still clearly visible , loomed a reminder of what had brought everyone together on this warm evening - the cloud of smoke that still billows from where the world trade center once stood .
before sunday , most of the remembrance services for those killed and injured in the trade center had been impromptu affairs .
but the holy day represented a chance for new york 's christian community to try and share their pain before god .
' drawn to come here ' for some , like beverly miller , it was a chance to get away from the wall-to-wall television coverage of events .
greg packer holds a missing person flyer " i had n't planned to come to the cathedral .
i was sitting at home watching the same pictures of the towers on fire and collapsing , and i felt drawn to come here . "
others , like greg packer , who is at the very front of the queue , would never normally set foot in a catholic cathedral .
" i 'm of the jewish faith .
the jewish new year is this week but it does n't mean anything to me this time .
there is too much else to think about . "
he holds a flyer with the face of a woman who has been missing since tuesday - just one of the thousands thought to have been killed in the terror strikes .
" i do n't know her but i just got given it by her husband .
every chance i 've had i 've shown it to people . "
last phone call a little further down the line stands monica iken .
she also has a missing person flyer , of her husband michael .
they were married last year and had been due to celebrate their first wedding anniversary in october .
monica iken 's husband worked in the twin towers michael , 37 , telephoned his wife to say he was okay when the first of the twin trade towers was hit - he was in the other one .
his office was evacuated and some of his colleagues got out alive , but michael probably stayed back to help someone , says monica .
monica remains composed .
she was baptised at st patrick 's and graduated there and her faith tells her that michael is still alive .
" you break down and then you get your strength back .
i 'm taking sedatives to help calm me , " she says .
monica and her friends and family file into the church shortly afterwards .
they join a congregation that includes united nations secretary general kofi annan , senator joe lieberman and new york 's mayor , rudy giuliani .
a nun clutches the order of service and a rose despite the gloom , cardinal egan 's sermon uplifts the crowd .
rounds of applause greet his praise for the city 's police , fire and ambulance crews who were among the first on the scene on tuesday morning , and whose personnel figure heavily in the death toll .
we have seen new york at its best , we have seen the best of new york at its best cardinal egan " this past week you and i and all of greater new york have seen evil up close .
men and women were killed by faceless criminals and we were stunned and confused , " says the priest .
" we were not however shaken .
rather , the best of us donned hard hats and workmen 's clothes and forced ourselves to deal with this horror as decent human beings .
" we have seen new york at its best .
we have seen the best of new york at its best .
and we have seen new jersey , connecticut and the rest of the nation coming to the aid of new york at their best .
" i would like to thank our police officers , our fire fighters , our emergency workers and our health care professionals . "
patriotic feeling was strong among the congregation they are stirring words for the congregation , yet for one worshipper at the steps of the cathedral , it is all too much .
her wails of grief pierce the respectful silence and she collapses .
help is close by in the form of two ambulances .
when they roll up outside the church a few minutes later to tend to the emergency , it is to the sound of spontaneous and sustained applause from the city 's appreciative public .
clearly new yorkers still believe they have something for which to be thankful . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's duncan kennedy " they think it could take six months to clear manhatten " the loya jirga political healing what is a loya jirga ?
