zacarias moussaoui , 33 , was detained on immigration charges in august when he aroused suspicion at a minnesota flight school where he sought training .
he is reported to have said he wanted to learn how to fly planes but was not interested in how to take off and land them .
the charges conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy conspiracy to destroy aircraft conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction conspiracy to murder us government employees conspiracy to destroy us government property he has been held in custody as a material witness in the investigation of the attacks .
mr moussaoui , a french citizen of moroccan descent , is the first person to be indicted since the suicide attacks which killed an estimated 3,900 people .
four of the six charges faced by mr moussaoui are punishable by death if he is found guilty , said us attorney general john ashcroft .
brenda keene , the admissions director at a flight school in oklahoma where mr moussaoui trained , said he was polite though exasperating at times .
al-qaeda will now meet the justice it abhors john ashcroft he was not regarded as a good student and was not allowed to fly solo even after 57 hours of instruction , compared with 12 to 20 hours for most students , she said .
his behaviour at the school - where he trained before moving to minnesota - did not arouse suspicion , she added .
the indictment came as ceremonies commemorating the dead were held around the world exactly three months after the attack .
conspiracy more than 1,000 people have been arrested in the united states since the attacks - most of them have not been identified by the us authorities .
mr ashcroft said the 30-page indictment also named mr moussaoui 's co-conspirators , including osama bin laden , america 's prime suspect in the terror attacks " al-qaeda will now meet the justice it abhors , " mr ashcroft said .
the attorney general said the indictment was " another victory in the war against terrorism . "
the indictment brought by a grand jury in the eastern district of virginia , says mr moussaoui underwent the " same preparation for murder as the hijackers " .
mr moussaoui is alleged to have received training in al-qaeda camps in afghanistan , sought pilot training and to have received funding from sources in germany and the middle east .
chemical attack fears mr moussaoui has been the subject of intense scrutiny since the attacks , which occurred while he was in custody .
the fbi had wanted to examine the hard drive of his computer , but the justice department refused to grant a search warrant because there did not seem enough evidence to suggest he was a terrorist threat .
us officials had earlier mentioned mr moussaoui as a possible 20th member of the suicide hijacking team .
the fbi director said the computer showed that mr moussaoui had gathered information about the " dispersal of chemicals " as well as about crop-duster planes .
the discovery prompted the bush administration to temporarily ground crop-dusters as a precaution against a possible biochemical attack .

" we 're glad to be the first japan life insurer to be given a licence in china , " said nippon life insurance spokesman wu mengfei .
insurance licences proved one of the most controversial issues in china 's wto accession talks , sparking a row between the united states and european union which threatened to derail the drafting of final accords .

but the us giant aig already has wholly-owned ventures in china and was determined to retain this privilege .

the latest insurers to get licences are predominantly japanese and american : metlife ; american international insurance ; manulife financial ; and tokio marine & fire insurance and nippon life .
better terms there are now more than 25 insurers operating in china 's fast growing insurance market .
although limited to 50 % ownership of their businesses in china , foreign firms are now allowed to choose their joint venture partners freely instead of having state-run partners imposed on them .
over the next five years , china will lift geographical restrictions which confine foreign insurers to firms to a couple of major cities , extend the types of business they can do into group insurance , health and pensions and permit wholly owned non-life subsidiaries .
foreign financial services firms stand to benefit substantially from china 's wto entry .

for around us $ 50 , the keyspan digital media remote control is a device that enables you to tirelessly operate your computer from 10 metres away , free from the keyboard or mouse .
with a click of a button , you can watch dvds or listen to any music files on your computer , which is great for people with large mp3 collections .
though it has been available for over a year , this remote control points to an interesting question .
how are advances in digital technology changing the way we use and experience different media ?
the internet is still celebrated as an active medium , one that stimulates user interaction and response .
with the increasing popularity of internet radio , as well as listening to music and watching video online , however , the internet now promotes more passive experiences .
controlling your tv control your computer from 10 metres away now , the growth and development of interactive tv is signalling new developments .
tv traditionally prompts a passive user experience .
one watches its seemingly hypnotic effects , often with barely any activity .
but the emerging field of interactive tv offers a change in the couch potato experience .
here , the user actively participates in their television viewing , deciding not only what they want to see , but potentially decide what camera position to watch , and also call up on screen all sorts of textual and visual information .
active experiences consequently , we are at an interesting and uncertain moment in the development of television and the internet-enabled computer and the relationships they promise and foster with us .
the computer experience is being developed as a more passive medium , while the tv is being developed to have more active components .
it remains unclear how this will all play out .
what kinds of media content and user experiences will grab and hold the public 's attention ?
and what will be viable from business perspectives ?
