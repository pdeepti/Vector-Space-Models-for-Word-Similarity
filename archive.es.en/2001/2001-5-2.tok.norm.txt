police claimed their tactics were successful in neutralising the threat of anti-capitalist rioters as thousands gathered in the capital 's west end .
most of the demonstrations passed off peacefully , although there were a handful of disturbances despite the presence of more than 6,000 police .
may day protests 92 arrests in london 50 people injured 29 hospitalised three police officers hurt 400 join carnival-style protest in glasgow 60 march in manchester two arrests in bristol activists criticised the decision to corral up to 5,000 demonstrators in oxford circus for more than eight hours , although police said this was necessary to avoid violence and damage to property .
there was a tense stand-off as police and demonstrators came to blows in a series of minor scuffles , but as night fell police drip-fed demonstrators out of the main crowd and by 2200bst on tuesday just a few hundred remained in the oxford street area .
there was no repeat of last year 's vandalism of monuments and widespread destruction .
occasional skirmishes but by the end of the day one group of militant activists was able to evade police in riot gear , smashing shop fronts on nearby tottenham court road .
they started to disperse shortly after 2230bst .
there had been occasional skirmishes elsewhere throughout a day of largely peaceful protest .
a supermarket in victoria was " stormed " by 15 masked activists chanting anti-capitalist slogans and attempts were made to attack the niketown and john lewis stores on oxford street .
in one incident , a jaguar caught up in the throngs of protesters was attacked .
police made 92 arrests - including eight foreign nationals from denmark , poland , belgium and the united states - and weapons seized by the police included a loaded airgun and a martial arts weapon .
over 50 people were injured and 29 needed hospital treatment , london ambulance service said .
' heavy-handed tactics ' they included three police officers , one of whom was a female officer who lost consciousness in the crush but was later discharged from hospital .
one police horse was also hurt .
protester martin empson was one of many who felt police tactics were " heavy-handed " .
this appalling vandalism shows the decision to contain the protesters was right ken livingstone london mayor he said : " we marched up towards oxford circus where we were boxed in by police for about seven hours .
" that left most of the protesters feeling incredibly frustrated and more than a little angry at what they saw as over-the-top policing . "
but metropolitan police authority chairman lord harris commended the police for their handling of the event .
" i believe they struck the right balance between facilitating peaceful demonstrations and deterring violent disorder , " he said .
loose alliance " the police tactic of containment in and around the flashpoint of oxford street to avoid serious injuries to innocent people and damage to property proved to be the right one . "
the london protests , joined by a loose alliance of anti-capitalists , environmental campaigners and animal rights activists , began in carnival style with mass cycle rides through the streets and chanting .
but the atmosphere became more heated after a large group gathered in oxford street at the climax of what the organisers called a game of may day monopoly , based on the board game 's locations .
there were skirmishes between police and demonstrators in side streets and the worst of the trouble erupted when a large crowd of protesters tried to break through the police cordon at around 1600bst .
the protesters were contained in large groups around oxford circus but at around 2030bst up to 60 people broke away and focused on nearby tottenham court road .
rampage condemned they overturned a car , smashed shopfronts with rocks and other missiles , targeting firms including the royal bank of scotland , abbey national , barclays bank , coffee republic and habitat , and attempted to set fire to a tesco store .
the protest is estimated to have cost london 's businesses up to £ 20m in lost revenue as dozens of businesses were forced to shut with repair and policing costs also considerable .
london mayor ken livingstone condemned the tottenham court road rampage : " this appalling vandalism shows the decision to contain the protesters was right .
" the immediate turn to violence on dispersal indicates that this was the core objective of the organisers . "

the national institute for clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- is supposed to decide which new treatments are cost effective for the nhs and end what ministers call postcode rationing .
however , some doctors are openly disagreeing with the institute 's medical assessments , while others are questioning its political independence .
dr stephen jenkins , a leading cardiologist at st thomas ' hospital in london , together with his colleagues , is ignoring nice guidance on the use of an anti-blood clotting drug called reopro - and as an acknowledged expert in the field , has written his own .
my concern about reopro is that it is very expensive and it is n't necessary to use it to the extent that nice guidelines recommend dr stephen jenkins he said : " my concern about reopro is that it is very expensive and it is n't necessary to use it to the extent that nice guidelines recommend .

the institute has now asked for an entirely new set of papers on the drugs ' economic costs and benefits - in effect virtually starting a large chunk of assessment process again from scratch .

the welsh affairs committee is due to take evidence from sir brian moffat after the steelmakers turned down union proposals to save some of the threatened jobs .
steelworkers decided to ballot on industrial action in response to corus 's latest rejection of a rescue bid to save 1,300 jobs at llanwern , in south wales .
corus director tony pedder has been accused of " industrial sabotage " after he said the proposals were " not a viable alternative because of long-term change in the uk marketplace " .
" this systematic sabotage is disgraceful and hypocritical , " said iron and steel trades confederation general secretary michael leahy .
" regretfully , we must conclude that corus never had any intention of working with us to save plants and jobs . "
the union had suggested maintaining steel production at one million tonnes per year , opposing corus 's plan to completely end steel production at the plant .
mr pedder has already rejected similar union proposals at shotton on deeside , north wales , and at ebbw vale and bryngwyn in south wales .
the decision by the anglo-dutch company to end crude steel production at the llanwern site near newport will mean a huge down-sizing of the giant plant .
regretfully we must conclude that corus never had any intention of working with us to save plants and jobs istc general secretary michael leahy while the unions have conceded that production does have to be reduced , they have also come up with a rescue package aimed at preserving all the jobs under threat .
corus announced in february that it planned to streamline operations , cutting more than 6,000 jobs across the uk - with 3,500 of them in wales .
mr pedder toured welsh steel towns last month , delivering the same grim and uncompromising message to corus workers .
at shotton in flintshire , he told unions that one of the plant 's production lines had to close .
they had been arguing that the resulting job losses can and should be avoided .
buy-out rejected hours later he was in south wales , telling workers at the bryngwyn works in gorseinon near swansea that their plant was to close altogether .
the small and specialised works has a record of making profits for corus , but union offers to buy it have been rejected .
corus and the steel unions will meet again on thursday for what union leaders describe as a " showdown meeting " .
the union leaders will ask sir brian moffat whether a single job can be saved .
following the meeting the unions are also expected to decide whether or not to call on the welsh assembly and the department of trade and industry to reveal plans to help workers who will be made redundant .

development the new opportunities fund distributes national lottery money to health , education and environment projects across the uk .

the autumn of an opera tenor 's career is a difficult time , when a voice trained well beyond its natural capacity and starting to decline has to be nurtured through demanding arias - which the audience will often remember from the singer 's prime .
he can still do some things of which most others can only dream martin kettle , the guardian pavarotti was unable to hit a high c during a 1995 performance of donizetti 's la fille du regiment , and there were decidedly mixed reviews for january 's ramades in aida in new york .
but even his critics accept that his voice can still display something of the ringing perfection of his glory years .
football pavarotti was born in modena , italy , on october 12 , 1935 , the first and only child of a baker .
as a boy , he was more interested in football than music and earned his first local fame as a member of the town 's soccer team .
he first sang in the town chorus with his father , an opera lover and gifted amateur tenor .
when the rossini male chorus won first prize in an international competition , pavarotti decided to pursue music full-time .
his debut came on 29 april , 1961 , in one of the great tenor roles , rodolfo in puccini 's la bohème at the opera house in reggio emilia .
partnership after italian success came engagements in amsterdam , vienna , zurich , and london .
his american debut came in february 1965 , in a miami production of donizetti 's lucia di lammermoor with joan sutherland - the start of what would become a historic partnership .
it was in the united states in 1972 that pavarotti produced one of his legendary performances , when in la fille du regiment at new york 's metropolitan opera he sang nine effortless high cs - causing the audience to erupt in a frenzied ovation .
he has long been associated with london / decca records and his recordings are consistently best sellers , covering a wide range of the opera repertoire as well as anthologies of neapolitan and other italian songs .
but pavarotti 's fame broadened dramatically when he took part in one of the most remarkable classical concerts of recent times during the 1990 world cup - as one of the three tenors .
hit with josé carreras and placido domingo , pavarotti was broadcast around the world singing a selection of famous arias and popular songs .
the broadcast was a major ratings hit and the subsequent record one of the biggest selling classical discs of all time .
his concert in london 's hyde park , in the presence of charles and diana , the prince and princess of wales , was the first classical concert in the history of the park and drew some 150,000 people .
in june 1993 , more than 500,000 fans gathered to enjoy his performance in new york 's central park and in september 1993 he sang in the shadow of the eiffel tower in paris to a further 300,000 fans .
while there were many in the classical world who criticised the outdoor concerts as a stunt , his defenders said that doing a valuable job in popularising opera - and letting large numbers hear one of history 's great voices .
there were also critical grumbles about his duets with pop stars like sting , bono and bryan adams .
but pavarotti has also been dedicated to the development of young singers , conducting standing-room-only master classes at conservatories around the world .
allegations in 1982 , he initiated a prestigious international vocal competition , culminating in final performances in philadelphia .
but recent allegations of tax evasion threaten to leave quite the wrong memories as the singer 's career draws to a close .
pavarotti was also a celebrity patron of troubled charity war child uk , but quit along with other celebrities after the co-founder and a charity consultant were accused of accepting an alleged bribe .
few would argue that his has not been a historic career .
as the guardian 's martin kettle said of pavarotti 's last , troubled performance of aida : " if this proves to be pavarotti 's operatic stage swansong , he will have gone out proving he can still do some things of which most others can only dream . "

los angeles mayor richard riordan warned recently : " we could turn back to the days of high unemployment and economic recession . "
a study commissioned by the mayor estimates that an all-out strike could cost the area nearly $ 7bn in lost revenue and about 130,000 jobs .
this would push the city 's unemployment rate from about nearly 5 % to 7 % .
the impact on the state of california , where agriculture and other industries are also important , is less devastating .
maximum impact however , fears for the film industry have been compounded by other troubles in the region - the local power crisis and the bite of a us economic slowdown .
" if it was a normal time , it would not have the same impact , " says variety 's mr gaydos .
film revenues 2000 : $ 44bn 2004 forecast : $ 54bn source : veronis suhler he adds the uncertainty has a domino effect on smaller businesses , such as luxury car companies and estate agents , that depend on discretionary spending by the wealthy .
" it is also a big deal for the state and the country , beyond its economic impact , " he says , pointing to the industry 's enormous success as an export product .
about 85 % of international screens are filled with american films , says mr gaydos , adding that anything impeding that market position is a serious concern .
according to veronis suhler 's communications industry forecast , the us film industry generated about $ 44bn in revenues in 2000 , representing a 2 % increase on 1999 .
this figure is expected to increase to almost $ 54bn by 2004 , with the industry forecast to grow at nearly 6 % over five years .
the us film industry also dwarfs its counterparts around the world in terms of revenue .
a bigger slice domestically , the us box office continues " to hold its own as a popular way to spend a night out " , reports the us merchant bank veronis suhler .
however , the growing popularity of dvd , coupled with quick turnaround from blockbuster film to blockbuster video is also helping to drive sales , the bank adds .
variety 's mr gaydos estimates that film revenues are usually split pretty evenly between the theatrical business - the showing of films at home and abroad - and additional sales - dvd , video and other products .
the fact that us writers and actors want a bigger slice of the new formats is not surprising .
in 2000 , video and dvd sales generated $ 20bn , almost half of the industry 's total output .
at the outset of contract negotiations , the writers guild of america was demanding a $ 100m increase for its workers over three years .
the screenwriter guild has said that hollywood writers earned a total of about $ 1.2bn in 2000 .
the guild also estimates that the median salary for a writer working west of the mississippi was about $ 84,000 last year .
mr gaydos points out that this means top writers probably made about $ 7m each over the year , while the vast majority of guild members earned very little .
for example , john wells , president of the guild and writer-producer of the tv series er and political drama the west wing , is rumoured to earn about $ 35-50m a year .
to put it all into perspective , a-list actors , such as julia roberts , tom hanks and tom cruise can demand about $ 20m for 12-16 weeks on a film shoot .
shutting the town down actors also hold more sway over the local economy .
a walk-out by the actors ' union is feared the most , says mr gaydos .
a strike by the writers would not " shut down the town as completely " .
in a desperate attempt to forestall any fall-out from a strike , film studios have been racing to complete new films , such as jodie foster 's the panic room .
" they have been shooting films and tv shows on every available piece of land , free set and free lot , just to stockpile films , " says one media analyst .
the frenzy reflects just how panicked the industry is at the prospect of a strike .
and even if california 's economy is not set to suffer greatly , the community of los angeles will be biting its glossy nails down to the quick as it awaits the outcome of the contract negotiations .

we 're working very hard to reach an agreement - that 's it writers ' guild spokeswoman the exisiting contract expired at midnight -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- .
a spokeswoman for the writers ' guild of america -lrb- wga -rrb- told the bbc that no new deadline had been set and that the two sides would continue their discussions into the night in the hope of reaching an agreement .
a strict news blackout surrounds the talks , which are focused on a demand for better pay .
key sticking points include residuals - the monies writers receive when their work is repeated on cable tv and in foreign markets - and payments from video and dvd sales .
" at this hour the talks are continuing , and we 're working very hard to reach an agreement - that 's it , " said the wga 's cheryl rhoden shortly after the deadline passed .
she added that the guild 's contract with the alliance of motion picture and television producers -lrb- amptp -rrb- , which represents the studios and networks , had not been extended .
if the talks fail then screenwriters will be balloted on strike action .
a strike would effectively put a stop to new productions in hollywood as very few scripts are kept in reserve .
ballot the actors ' union is expected to follow suit unless a similar financial claim against the alliance of motion picture and television producers is settled .
the first shows to be hit would probably be late-night talk shows and day-time soaps .
the writers ' guild has not yet balloted its 11,500 members for strike action - a necessary step before any strike can take place - allowing writers to continue working .
last week los angeles mayor richard riordan released a study showing that a prolonged strike could cost the local economy $ 6.9bn -lrb- £ 4.7bn -rrb- and put 100,000 jobs at risk .
screenwriters are also demanding that directors drop the " a film by ... " credit , which they argue relegates their job to a lower position .
production scramble studios have been rushing to finish as many tv and film projects as possible .
films under threat include basic instinct 2 , indiana jones 4 and quentin tarantino 's kill bill .
morrie goldman , of la 's entertainment industry development corporation , said there had been " a definite increase " in on-location film and television productions .
some 160 productions were being shot on the streets of los angeles in the run-up to the talks deadline .
" right now the studios have enough movies to take them through next february or march , " said jack valenti of the motion picture association of america .
but those working at the planning stage of production are feeling the pinch .
everyone from grips and cameramen to truck drivers and caterers will have little to do if no films or tv shows are being made .
the last strike by hollywood writers , in 1998 , lasted five months .

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- farmer criticises ' mobile burning ' low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 2 may , 2001 , 07:40 gmt 08:40 uk farmer criticises ' mobile burning ' sheep on the farm will be burned in a mobile unit moves to use a mobile incinerator to burn foot-and-mouth animal carcasses dug up after burial in mid wales has been attacked as a " complete bungle " .
farmer richard tutton said the use of a mobile unit would not allay health fears expressed over the use of pyres to burn animals .
the burning of 1,500 sheep at buttington hall farm , near welshpool , was halted after representations by dyfed-powys health officials .
crisis in wales total confirmed cases uk-wide 1,522 - with 83 in wales powys - 50 cases anglesey - 13 cases monmouthshire - 16 cases caerphilly 1 rhondda cynon taff - 1 neath port talbot -1 newport - 1 the animals were dug up after it was discovered they had been buried too close to a water supply .
welsh rural affairs minister carwyn jones confirmed on tuesday that the normal burning methods had been halted , following concerns raised by dyfed-powys health authority .
pyres use large quantities of railway sleepers , coal and diesel to burn the carcasses , leading to concerns about the health side effects from the smoke .
mr tutton said the use of the mobile unit was a much larger operation than anticipated , with the laying of tonnes of stone into the field .
he said the use of large amounts of material to burn the carcasses undermined the argument against pyres .
there is a mood of despondency among farmers " this so-called cleaner incinerator burns 400-500 pallets an hour , " claimed mr tutton .
" i am extremely angry ; this has been a complete bungle by officials . "
mr tutton said the original burial operation on the site by ministry of agriculture officials had been conducted very well .
he added that the plans to burn the animals on a normal pyre were proceeding well before the about-turn in policy .
alternative union meanwhile , on tuesday welsh hill farmers announced that they are to set up a new breakaway union in response to the foot-and-mouth crisis .
despite the existence of two farming unions in wales , hill farmers from gwynedd and powys have said they are unhappy with their existing representation at the welsh assembly in cardiff and that they need a stronger voice to argue their case .
the so far unnamed new union - the first in the industry since the launch of the farmers ' union of wales in 1955 - will be officially launched at a meeting at llanberis in north wales later this week .
a new disposal method is sought the new body says it has two immediate issues to fight both of which have emerged as a result of the disease outbreak .
they are the right to roam act which gives the public more access to the countryside , and the 20-day standstill rule which prevents sheep being moved for that period after they have been sold .
a third issue said to anger the breakaway group is cheap meat imports from abroad and direct action is already being considered .
meanwhile in north wales , an anglesey farmer who avoided a mass cull only to see his livestock slaughtered after a suspected outbreak on his farm , is still awaiting confirmation that foot-and-mouth was present .
the owners of the farm on llanddaniel , near gaerwen on the island - which has been badly hit by the outbreak where more than 40,000 sheep have been culled - had been part of a group who successfully argued against the slaughter of their 60 ewes , lambs and three cattle .
if the virus is confirmed it will be the first case on the island for five weeks and a major setback in the fight to eradicate the disease .
the couple have been dubbed one of the " anglesey seven " - a group which took a stand against the mass cull policy .
union leaders have called for livestock on other farms on the island to be culled as well .

the show , hosted by tv presenter anne robinson , pulled in chart-topping audiences in its first two weeks .
it had 15 , 14 and 17.5 million households on the first three nights respectively of its opening run , which easily beat other networks ' shows .
but nielsen media research estimate just 7.9 million us households tuned in to watch robinson humiliate contestants in the us version of the bbc hit in its regular monday slot .
now it has slipped behind a drama show on the rival cbs network , the king of queens , which had 100,000 more viewers that monday .
there are indications that the weakest link is not reaching the vital market of young people as it fell to fourth place in new york , an audience section seen as the barometer of public opinion .
this means that the nbc network will have to cut advertising rates around the show .
' bogeyman ' critics and audiences have been split over robinson 's rude style .
nbc have played on anne 's dominatrix image , billing her as tv 's rudest woman .
the new york post newspaper devoted a front page to robinson in the opening week of the show , under the headline host from hell .
viewers have described her as everything from " sophisticated " to the new " bogeyman " .
the quiz was originally scheduled to run for 13 episodes but the early ratings success of the show convinced nbc bosses to extend the programme 's life to 26 episodes .
there had been reports that the show may go head-to-head with the other successful british exported quiz , who wants to be a millionaire ?
the us version of the show regularly pulls in 19 million viewers for abc , making it the country 's most popular show .
a showdown between the quizzes had been seen as likely by television industry commentators once the weakest link had established itself as hit material .
nbc has not confirmed whether the quiz will now take on the who wants to be a millionaire ? challenge .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- $ 1,350bn us tax cut deal low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 2 may , 2001 , 08:41 gmt 09:41 uk $ 1,350bn us tax cut deal bush : " a great day for the american people " republicans in the us congress reached a tentative agreement to a $ 1,350bn , 11-year tax cut , giving president george w bush most of the tax reduction he has wanted .
but the cut is less than both president bush and republican party leaders had been hoping for .
the treasury will be ready , willing and able to implement the president 's tax relief plan as soon as the congress acts paul o 'neill , us treasury secretary " this is a great day for the american people and the american taxpayer , " president bush said .
bush had called for a 10 year , $ 1,600bn tax reduction in his campaign for the republican presidential nomination in 1999 , making it the pillar of his economic plan .
only last week did he concede he would have to compromise .
the decision on spending would removes a major hurdle to completing a compromise budget for 2002 that largely reflects bush 's fiscal priorities .
the deal now has to go back to both houses of congress for final approval .
but it has the backing of key moderate democrats , led by louisiana senator john breaux , assuring its passage in the evenly-divided senate .
quick action republican leaders were hoping to push the budget through congress this week , clearing the way for the senate to quickly draft the tax legislation .
under the deal , the senate and house agreed to tax cuts over ten years of $ 1,250bn , plus an additional emergency tax cut of $ 100bn this year to stimulate the economy .
if that was distributed equally among all taxpayers , it would amount to around $ 500 per person .
us treasury secretary paul o 'neill said that the treasury had already moved to purchase the paper necessary for printing and mailing rebate cheques .
" i 'm hopeful the congress will vote on tax relief by june 1 .
the treasury will be ready , willing and able to implement the president 's tax relief plan as soon as the congress acts , " he added .
the tax compromise means that some parts of president 's plans will have to be dropped .
speculation is that president bush 's proposal to eliminate all estate duties and federal inheritance taxes might not survive the final negotiations .
other parts of the plan include a reduction in tax rates , including cutting the top rate from 39 % to 33 % , an increase in the child tax allowance , and a restoration of the married couples allowance .
spending plans more difficult will be agreeing to stick to budget spending targets , which is still the subject of negotiation between the house and senate .
the senate had wanted to increase overall spending by 8 % this year , while the house has backed president bush 's call for spending to be held at 4 % growth overall .
a compromise figure of 5 % has been suggested .
the conservative republicans in the house are unlikely to accept a much higher figure - although there is pressure to increase the defence budget substantially , with proposals for 80 new weapon systems costing $ 30bn to $ 40bn in the pipeline .
house republican leader dick armey warned that republicans might defy the leadership and vote against further spending increases .
" as you move -lrb- the spending -rrb- number up , you see republicans dropping off at a faster rate than you see democrats coming on , " he said .
under president bush 's proposed budget , there were to be increases in spending on education , defence and agriculture , while other spending categories were substantially cut back .
