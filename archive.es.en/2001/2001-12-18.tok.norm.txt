a brand of oral vaccine made from calf foetus serum was withdrawn last year after fears that it could be contaminated with bse .
the department of health said that of five people who had developed vcjd in the southampton area in 1994 , two had been given vaccine made from uk-sourced bovine calf serum .
but a meeting of the independent spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee -lrb- seac -rrb- later found no evidence that the vaccine carried a risk of vcjd .
wellcome produced around 30 million doses of the vaccine between the late 1980s and october last year .
it was then withdrawn after the department of health learned that the manufacturers ' assurances over the calf foetus serum were inaccurate .
contaminated products seac also stressed that any historical theoretical risk had to be balanced against the " overwhelming benefits " of the immunisation programme .
many scientists believe that humans can contract vcjd after eating contaminated products from cows with bse .
current vaccines use bovine material sourced in australia , new zealand , the usa or canada .
there were 113 cases of definite or probable vcjd in the uk between 1996 when doctors distinguished it as a new form of the rare brain-wasting disease cjd and 3 december .
common factors at that date 10 patients were still alive .
the national cjd surveillance unit looks for common factors , including medical and personal history , in all vcjd cases .
the department of health said in a statement : " finding common factors does not mean that a cause has been identified - but we report such findings to seac so that any implications can be assessed . "

but at 9.8 % - down from 10.1 % both in july and in last october - it remains one of the highest rates in asia .
and according to the asian development bank -lrb- adb -rrb- , stubbornly high rates of poverty in the philippines - perhaps 40 % of the population or 31 million people , according to president gloria arroyo 's figures - will persist without much stronger economic growth .
this year 's economic expansion will be 2.7 % against last year 's 4 % , the adb recently estimated .
given population growth of 2.3 % , " there 's not much of a positive dent on poverty reduction " , the adb 's country director for the philippines , gunter hecker , told a local newspaper .
rural poverty the high rate of population growth is shown in the jobless statistics .
while the proportion of the unemployed workforce shrank in the three months to october , the overall number grew to 3.3 million people from 3.1 million a year earlier , as the total labour force expanded by 7.9 % .
service industries picked up most of the slack as consumers kept spending despite the economic slowdown , with employment up 10 % to 14.2 million over a year ago .
agriculture also expanded , with 8.2 % more people employed in the sector .
over-priced staples but agriculture , along with unequal distribution of assets , remains the source of many of the philippines ' poverty problems , the adb said .
agriculture accounts for less than 20 % of the economy , but over a third of employment , and produces over-priced staples such as rice which inflate the cost of labour .
but the current difficult economic environment makes solving these problems difficult , the adb acknowledged .
and it could offer few solutions , except for continuing to keep budget deficits down , improve government revenue and stabilise the economy with political reforms .

misgivings but on monday the justice department said the us government should reject the proposed alliance unless certain conditions were put in place .
these include granting rival american carriers at least nine daily round trips to london 's heathrow airport from new york and boston .
the statement from the justice department said the alliance would give ba and aa more than 50 % of the flights in many markets and an even higher share of the business travel market .

aa has argued for the new alliance by saying that the airline industry has changed greatly in five years .
in particular , aa said trans-atlantic travel is less concentrated at heathrow , where ba 's operations are centred .
decision due the transportation department is expected to make a final decision on the alliance by early next year .

members of the all-party welsh affairs select committee are set to question the society 's chairman , ian sparks , and lady toulson , chair of the board of trustees about the controversial move .
the decision of the children 's society to close down its welsh arm continues to spark anger in the political world .
prime minister tony blair said he was disappointed by the news , and members of the welsh select committee are due to step up pressure on the society to reconsider the decision .
there is concern that the pull-out will shut down 13 projects designed to help vulnerable children and lead to the loss of over 120 jobs .
the society has said that all small and medium-sized charities are struggling to survive in the current economic climate .
it argues that this is a particular problem for church charities and those working with children .
on 14 december , trustees of the children 's society refused to reverse its decision to pull out of wales .
but they did agree to explore options for a further five years ' funding for projects .
teenagers who have benefitted from the church-funded organisation 's work and staff facing redundancy had travelled to london to lobby the society 's board of trustees for millions in continued funding .
the trip followed an announcement in november that the charity was pulling out of wales in a bid to solve cashflow problems around the uk .
their aim was to secure a share of the society 's £ 4m reserves but no cash had been committed to operations in wales at the end of the meeting .
the society 's communications officer for wales said : " we welcome this small movement and want to work with them but we are disappointed because we wanted much more . "
negative impact ' the closure of the welsh operation provoked fierce criticism , with a furious reverend rowan williams , the archbishop of wales , claiming the decision could have a negative impact on the lives of many youngsters in wales .
he immediately withdrew church in wales funding from the society 's projects , and set up a new fund to hold any money raised while discussions continue about the future of the charity .
anger was compounded last week when the society announced reward strategy payments of £ 300,000 for staff in england .
the society is aiming to balance a £ 6m shortfall in funds across its work .

the yen is plumbing fresh lows almost on a daily basis , having last week passed the nadir marked three years ago .
further downward pressure came today , as finance minister masajuro shiokawa urged the bank of japan -lrb- boj -rrb- to make even more money available to the economy .
the extra liquidity , he believes , could help encourage spending as corporations and investors rush to balance the books at the end of the year .
if funds are lacking , the pace of bankruptcies could accelerate sharply .
few options signs of an easing monetary policy are usually the trigger for exchange rate falls .
but in japan , matters are complicated by the fact that monetary policy is already looser than anywhere else in the world .
the interest rate is practically zero , in the hope that banks saddled with huge bad debts will start lending again and consumers might stop saving and start spending .
that has so far not helped .
many economists believe that too many companies have too much bad debt , and many need to go bust to clear the dead wood out of the economy .
but that would massively increase unemployment , already at record levels above 5 % .
and consumers are already reluctant to spend , since prices are falling every month and there seems little point in buying now when goods will be cheaper in the future .
what now ?
so although economists think there is a 50-50 chance that the boj will do something - not least because of the massive political pressure from the likes of mr shiokawa - it is not clear exactly what can be done other than boosting liquidity .
it could buy more japanese government bonds - except that the government has long promised to cap that option , given the country 's huge public deficit of well over 100 % of gross domestic product .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- yen slides as bankers mull options categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 18 december , 2001 , 07:26 gmt yen slides as bankers mull options as japan 's top bankers meet to discuss what they can do to help the moribund economy out of its trough , the country 's currency is continuing to dig its own .
the yen is plumbing fresh lows almost on a daily basis , having last week passed the nadir marked three years ago .
further downward pressure came today , as finance minister masajuro shiokawa urged the bank of japan -lrb- boj -rrb- to make even more money available to the economy .
the extra liquidity , he believes , could help encourage spending as corporations and investors rush to balance the books at the end of the year .
if funds are lacking , the pace of bankruptcies could accelerate sharply .
few options signs of an easing monetary policy are usually the trigger for exchange rate falls .
but in japan , matters are complicated by the fact that monetary policy is already looser than anywhere else in the world .
the interest rate is practically zero , in the hope that banks saddled with huge bad debts will start lending again and consumers might stop saving and start spending .
that has so far not helped .
many economists believe that too many companies have too much bad debt , and many need to go bust to clear the dead wood out of the economy .
but that would massively increase unemployment , already at record levels above 5 % .
and consumers are already reluctant to spend , since prices are falling every month and there seems little point in buying now when goods will be cheaper in the future .
what now ?
so although economists think there is a 50-50 chance that the boj will do something - not least because of the massive political pressure from the likes of mr shiokawa - it is not clear exactly what can be done other than boosting liquidity .
it could buy more japanese government bonds - except that the government has long promised to cap that option , given the country 's huge public deficit of well over 100 % of gross domestic product .
it could lower the official interest rate - although at 0.1 % it is so close to zero already that further cuts would make little difference .
or it could buy commercial bonds and other securities - except that legal difficulties are likely to get in the way .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- prescription drug deaths surge categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 18 december , 2001 , 08:03 gmt prescription drug deaths surge medication mistakes are a major problem , says the report the number of patients who die after being given the wrong drugs in hospital is increasing dramatically , according to a major report .
approximately 1,200 people died last year in england and wales as a direct consequence of the drugs they were prescribed - a rise of 500 % over the past decade .
some of these deaths were due to medication errors by doctors or nurses , others due to adverse reactions to medicines .
the audit commission 's " a spoonful of sugar " report says many of these deaths were entirely avoidable as they were a result of doctors not having the right information about the patients at hand - either because notes are illegible , incomplete or missing altogether .
statistics suggest than one in 10 people in hospital suffer some kind of " adverse event " , half of which are preventable .
one third of these lead to additional illness - or death - and on average each adds eight-and-a-half days to a hospital stay .
mistakes found in one hospital cancer patient prescribed sleeping tablet temazepam instead of anti-cancer drug tamoxifen a toxic medicine was prescribed to be given daily instead of weekly an anti-cancer medicine prescribed at 1,000 times the correct dose a contraceptive steroid prescribed in the place of an anti-psychotic drug nick mapstone , one of the report 's authors , said : " the health service is probably spending half a billion a year making better people who experienced an adverse incident or error - and that does not include the human cost to patients . "
he said that modern medications could be far more effective - but had the potential to cause more harm if wrongly administered .
" it is relatively straightforward to fix but it requires investment , " said mr mapstone .
he said that as many as three quarters of the " avoidable " errors could be eliminated by introducing computerised prescribing systems .
best practice ' ignored ' the government has pledged to introduce these by 2005 , but mr mapstone told bbc news online that he did not believe that this deadline was likely to be met .
a series of high-profile cases have shown the frequency with which fatal drug mistakes can be made by doctors .
the health service is probably spending half a billion a year making better people who experienced an adverse incident or error nick mapstone , audit commission one of the most recent involved teenager wayne jowett , who died at queen 's medical centre in nottingham after having an anti-cancer drug wrongly injected into his spine .
the report says that managers should take care to make sure safety rules are being observed throughout hospitals .
it says : " the recent events at queen 's medical centre illustrate how day-to-day pressures can lead to acknowledged best practice being ignored . "
sir andrew foster , chairman of the audit commission , said : " there is a significant opportunity to improve quality , reduce clinical risk and minimise waste , by using current and future resources much more effectively and ensuring pharmacists are central to patient care . "
spotting errors the government is to introduce a series of measures to try to check the increase in medical errors in the nhs .
its report , " an organisation with a memory " , called for compulsory reporting and monitoring of adverse incidents so that hospitals and the nhs in general can learn from mistakes .
ministers have also set up the national patient safety agency to co-ordinate this .
this is a culture where mistakes do unfortunately happen dr trevor pickersgill dr trevor pickersgill , of the british medical association 's junior doctors committee , told the bbc there were a number of reasons for the rise in errors .
" the number of drugs is increasing , the effectiveness - and therefore often the toxicity - of drugs is increasing , the number of people on multiple medications is increasing , and that increases the risk of interaction .
" we must also remember that there one in six pharmacy posts in hospitals are unfilled , and new doctors who are doing the work on the wards are overworked as well .
" this is a culture where mistakes do unfortunately happen . "
jackie glatter , from the consumers ' association , said : " the report shows there is a strong need for detailed and clear patient information about treatments and medicines - not just in hospitals but also when people are taking medicine at home .
" the national patient safety agency should address medication errors as soon as possible . " watch / listen on this story the bbc 's karen allen " the problem is escalating " stella brackenbury , wayne jowett 's mother " there was no way back from this mistake " dr trevor pickersgill " the culture makes it likely that mistakes will happen " see also : 18 dec 01 -pipe- health prescription errors : case study 13 sep 01 -pipe- health patients ' still face ' anaesthetic risk 07 sep 01 -pipe- health women hit by breast screening blunder 03 aug 01 -pipe- health patient safety watchdog appointed 26 jun 01 -pipe- health milburn calls for ' end to blame ' 03 may 01 -pipe- health smear test errors : the history 19 apr 01 -pipe- health new rules to save patients ' lives 19 apr 01 -pipe- health drug blunder death ' accidental ' internet links : audit commission national patient safety agency consumers ' association the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top health stories now : postcode lottery in gp services ivf mix-up heads for court transplant first for cancer patient costly wait with dementia symptoms chicken checked for bse new hope for aids vaccine campaign to end stigma of mental illness parents to sue over epilepsy row links to more health stories are at the foot of the page .

unless the tories undergo dramatic change , they will be forever consigned to the margins - perhaps even falling , he has previously warned , behind the liberal democrats to become the third party of british politics .
to aid the process of urgent renewal , in the new year he and fellow former shadow cabinet member archie norman launch their long-awaited think tank .
there absolutely is such a thing as society francis maude called xchange , it will seek to modernise the party and broaden its appeal , promoting the " inclusiveness " agenda behind michael portillo 's unsuccessful leadership bid - which mr maude ran .
it will run an open , ' big tent ' approach with even labour figures eligible to publish their thoughts through it .
to counter charges that it will serve as the portillo-ite resistance to iain duncan smith 's command , the tory leader is to be its honorary president .
contemporary conservatism a key imperative of xchange , and its companion activist network cchange , is to build " a contemporary case for conservatism " which is not based solely on materialism or self-interest , says mr maude .
it must instead be an idealistic case .
michael portillo : francis maude helped run his unsuccessful leadership campaign in summing it up he touches on one of margaret thatcher 's most controversial pronouncements in order to discard it : " it is the belief that there absolutely is such a thing as society and communities and its strength comes from what people themselves do , not what government does . "
a further crucial requirement for the tories is a sincere " understanding how people live their lives today " .
by this , mr maude means more than mere tolerance .
he means " being a party that is genuinely , seriously , deep down inside ourselves respectful of people regardless of their background , colour , which side of the tracks they were born , gender and sexual orientation " .
nor is it an election-winning strategy ; more a pre-condition to taking part .
" this is the entry ticket - you do n't even get into the paddock , let alone onto the race course , unless you are genuinely a party that respects everyone . "
more women required all of this also means making the conservative party look a little more like the outside world , where half the population is female -lrb- compared to 14 out of 166 tory mps -rrb- and about 10 % from an ethnic minority -lrb- zero -rrb- .
it was shocking at the last election that as candidates to replace retiring tory mps there was not a single woman and not a single candidate from an ethnic minority ... that just has to change francis maude in concrete terms , this means intruding on local tory associations ' jealously-guarded autonomy when it comes to choosing parliamentary candidates , says mr maude .
" it was shocking at the last election that as candidates to replace retiring tory mps there was not a single woman and not a single candidate from an ethnic minority , " he points out .
" that just has to change . "
mr maude is no fan of all-women shortlists or quotas , but is even less keen on the all-male , all-white cast fielded for safe tory seats at the june general election .
he has found himself taking on selection committee prejudices face to face in the course of talking to local parties across the country , and admits that he gets " quite shirty " with objectors .
intervention in selections ' essential ' he points out that tory associations will in most cases accept the need for the party in parliament to better reflect the outside world - only to baulk at doing it in their own parties .
iain duncan smith : two years to prove himself ?
this political nimbyism has convinced him direct interference by tory central command is now the only answer .
" i do n't actually have much of a view whether you do that by all-women shortlists or quotas or whatever , " mr maude says .
" but i am absolutely sure that it will take intervention to make -lsb- more representative selection -rsb- happen ... if we do n't do it , then we continue to decline . "
both iain duncan smith and party chairman david davis have unequivocally ruled out such intervention .
mr maude believes they are , quite simply , wrong to have done so : " it is absolutely essential .
i think it 's a mistake to blanket rule out any intervention , because it will be needed . "
reactionary elements in short , what he proposes is a complete overhaul of the culture of his party , in the process challenging some of its deepest held prejudices .
how confident is he that this can be done ?
" i know that it has to be done , " is his side-stepping reply .
" these things are not enough to win an election but they are a necessary condition of doing so . "
but what about those reactionary elements - all parties have them - that will never be reconciled to the agenda he is championing ?
" they do exist in the conservative party , although they are much less widespread than many people think , " mr maude concedes .
but he insists that " most people in the party just want us to do whatever is necessary to get us winning again " .
probation period for ids if the mammoth task he has set out were not big enough in itself , the timescale in which mr maude believes it must be achieved is equally daunting : " by the end of two years .
by half-way through this parliament , this has got to be decisively done . "
he accepts this is an extremely short time for the kind of far-reaching action he is advocating .
" that 's why it 's urgent and i said it 's five to midnight , " is his firm reply .
and what if this tight timetable is not met ?
" then we 'll have a real problem , " is as strongly as he is willing to paint the consequences .
" this is not about leadership , it 's about change , " says mr maude when asked if in effect he lays down a two-year probation period for mr duncan smith 's performance in the top job .
a question of leadership ?
but of course it is most certainly also about leadership .
the kind of radical change francis maude is convinced must be wrought without delay within his - or indeed any - party can not happen despite its leadership .
" i think iain understands what the problem is and everything he has said reflects a readiness to address it , " he says .
" he will understand a need to do it quickly .
you ca n't do it by stealth . "
with mr duncan smith having rhetorically signed up to the aim of making the conservative party a creature more at one with the modern world , the next step is getting his hands dirty with the concrete changes and challenging of vested interests .
as mr maude puts it : " we will want to help him to make it happen . "

" that 's why it 's urgent and i said it 's five to midnight , " is his firm reply .
and what if this tight timetable is not met ?
" then we 'll have a real problem , " is as strongly as he is willing to paint the consequences .
" this is not about leadership , it 's about change , " says mr maude when asked if in effect he lays down a two-year probation period for mr duncan smith 's performance in the top job .
a question of leadership ?
but of course it is most certainly also about leadership .
the kind of radical change francis maude is convinced must be wrought without delay within his - or indeed any - party can not happen despite its leadership .
" i think iain understands what the problem is and everything he has said reflects a readiness to address it , " he says .
" he will understand a need to do it quickly .
you ca n't do it by stealth . "
with mr duncan smith having rhetorically signed up to the aim of making the conservative party a creature more at one with the modern world , the next step is getting his hands dirty with the concrete changes and challenging of vested interests .
as mr maude puts it : " we will want to help him to make it happen . "

there were no reports of any injuries among the 946 asylum seekers at the camp , but an unnamed government spokesman said 15 officers were treated for smoke inhalation .
