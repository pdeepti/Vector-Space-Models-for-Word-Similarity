it sounds something like the virgin birth .
technically , it is called parthenogenesis .
the human egg cell develops into an embryo without the addition of any genetic material from a sperm cell .
the embryo would be a clone of the mother .
it , too , could be a source of useful stem cells to grow into replacement tissues and organs to treat degenerative diseases .
and for some researchers , it overcomes the ethical dilemmas of " conventional " cloning because a mammal parthenote is incapable - so far as current science thinking is concerned - of become a viable foetus ; for others , it will be just another example of science going too far .
no father parthenogenesis has been observed in many lower animals , especially insects such as aphids .
in many social insects , like the honeybee and the ant , parthenogenesis gives rise to male drones .
fertilised eggs produce female workers and queens .
some larger animals can reproduce this way - there are a few lizards , for example .
parthenogenesis has also been artificially induced in frogs and snakes , although it quite often results in abnormal development .
persuading unfertilised eggs to start dividing like embryos was achieved in mice and monkeys fairly recently , but it has never been artificially induced in humans - until now , it would seem .
normally , it is only when a sperm cell merges with an ovum and a full set of genes is assembled that an embryo is formed and starts to develop .
mature eggs and sperm usually have only half the genetic material of a typical body cell , to prevent an embryo from having a double set of genes following conception .
eggs halve their genetic complement relatively late in their maturation cycle .
diseased heart but if an egg cell is somehow activated before that stage , it still has a full set of genes - and could develop into a functioning embryo clone .
stem cells derived from a parthenogenetically activated embryo would be unlikely to be rejected after transplantation .
such cells might also raise fewer moral dilemmas for some people than would stem cells derived through the " conventional " cloning process .
the act scientists suggest that one way this technique could be used would be for a woman with heart disease to have her own egg cells collected and activated in the laboratory to produce stem cells .
the stem cells could then be coaxed to become cardiac muscle cells that could be implanted back into the woman to patch a diseased area of the heart .
using a similar technique to create stem cells to treat a man would be trickier .
it would involve some genetic manipulation , such as transferring two nuclei from the man 's sperm into an egg that had been stripped of its nucleus .
such " male-only conception " , however , is highly speculative and few believe it will ever be possible .
expected cloning researchers have reported prompting eggs from mice and rabbits to divide into embryos by exposing them to chemicals .
as early as 1983 , it was demonstrated that stem cells isolated from parthenogenetic mouse embryos could form a variety of tissues , including nerve and muscle .
in act 's parthenogenesis experiments , 22 eggs were exposed to chemical activation .
after five days of growing in culture dishes , six eggs had developed into what appeared to be embryos , but none clearly contained the so-called inner-cell mass that yields stem cells .
because for females parthenogenesis would involve cell manipulation with no additional genetic material , it may prove to be a more ethically acceptable method of producing stem cells than the conventional transfer of nuclear dna material from another person .
sunday 's announcement is a major advance in human genetic manipulation and is more surprising than the production of the first human embryo clones , which commentators had been expecting for some time .
it is also an advance with potentially even more far-reaching implications .

the single features some of britain 's top r & b stars - damage , gabrielle , roachford and des 'ree - and jazz saxophonist courtney pine .
this is not a race thing , this is a youth thing gregg brown , songwriter proceeds from the sale of the single will go to the damilola taylor trust , which sponsors youth projects in the uk and nigeria .
ten-year-old damilola died in a stairwell in an estate in peckham , east london , after being stabbed in the leg on his way home from school on 27 november last year .
two 15-year-old boys have denied murder .
the trial has been set for 15 january next year .
' reality ' the tribute song was written by the us-born musician and journalist gregg brown , of the band osibisa .
" i was asked by a christian tv channel to film damilola 's funeral , " mr brown told bbc news online .
damage , pictured with damilola 's father -lrb- right -rrb- , sang on the single " it was at the point when the casket was brought out to the car from the funeral home that the reality hit me .
" i decided i had to make this thing happen .
" i made a few calls and managed to get everyone involved - and then i got frank tontoh to produce it , and he brought craig david 's keyboard player , guitarist and bass player . "
mr brown originally wrote the song as a response to the brixton riots of the early 1980s .
" it was a cry for people to come together .
" my philosophy is that we can change anything we want to change , if we come together as a people . "
the damilola taylor trust backs youth projects in inner cities in both the uk and nigeria , and mr brown hopes to set up a football academy through the fund - which he says will teach " leadership and responsibility " .
next week will also see the release of a celebrity fundraising single for victims of aids in africa , and for victims of the terror attacks of 11 september in new york .
britney spears , christina aguilera , mary j blige , bono , destiny 's child and michael stipe are among the artists who have contributed to the single - a version of the marvin gaye classic what 's going on ?
proceeds from the sales of the single , released on 5 november , will go to the global aids alliance and to aids prevention charities in africa .
the september 11th fund of the united way , for families of victims of the world trade center attacks , will also benefit . watch / listen on this story wake up the morning featuring gabrielle , des 'ree , damage , roachford and courtney pine a senseless loss of life in london the aftermath a community in shock emotional memorial background regenerating peckham social exclusion see also : 10 oct 01 -pipe- music musical tribute to damilola 17 aug 01 -pipe- uk boys deny damilola murder 27 may 01 -pipe- uk pop tribute for damilola 11 mar 01 -pipe- uk prince charles meets damilola 's parents internet links : metropolitan police artists against aids the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top music stories now : inquest opens into entwistle 's death gallagher attacks ' liar ' michael elvis and oasis enjoy chart success oasis score mini-festival hit star attacks ' racist ' music industry bowie dismisses kylie and robbie party rocks city park michael denies attack on bush links to more music stories are at the foot of the page .

rebuilding afghanistan will be no easy task by jonathan marcus bbc defence correspondent it looks like the beginning of the end for the taleban regime .
their last northern stronghold , kunduz , is reported to have fallen .
and the taleban 's heartland in the south , around the city of kandahar , is coming under assault from us ground troops .
operations are still unfolding and details are sketchy .
but it is clear that us troops have mounted an operation to secure the airport outside kandahar , which is being used to bring in a powerful strike force of us marines .
us aircraft have relentlessly pounded taleban targets two us marine corps expeditionary units are at sea off pakistan .
this gives the americans some 2,000 highly trained combat troops supported by a variety of armoured vehicles , helicopters , and even fixed wing harrier ground-attack aircraft .
some reports suggest that light vehicles were helicoptered in with the first wave of the attack .
heavier armoured vehicles could be landed by hercules transport aircraft if required .
hunt for al-qaeda their role is almost certainly to help in the hunt for al-qaeda and taliban leaders , rather than to mount a full-scale assault on kandahar itself .

rebuilding afghanistan will be no easy task by jonathan marcus bbc defence correspondent it looks like the beginning of the end for the taleban regime .
their last northern stronghold , kunduz , is reported to have fallen .
and the taleban 's heartland in the south , around the city of kandahar , is coming under assault from us ground troops .
operations are still unfolding and details are sketchy .
but it is clear that us troops have mounted an operation to secure the airport outside kandahar , which is being used to bring in a powerful strike force of us marines .
two us marine corps expeditionary units are at sea off pakistan .
this gives the americans some 2,000 highly trained combat troops supported by a variety of armoured vehicles , helicopters , and even fixed wing harrier ground-attack aircraft .
some reports suggest that light vehicles were helicoptered in with the first wave of the attack .
heavier armoured vehicles could be landed by hercules transport aircraft if required .
hunt for al-qaeda their role is almost certainly to help in the hunt for al-qaeda and taliban leaders , rather than to mount a full-scale assault on kandahar itself .
significantly their arrival in kandahar seems to have been preceded by an attack on taleban positions by local pashtun commanders .
the pentagon clearly hopes that their local knowledge , plus the stepped up activity of us special forces units , will provide the essential intelligence to enable the marines to make the best use of their combat potential .
the deployment of significant numbers of ground troops signals what could be the closing phase of this campaign .
but it 's not over yet .
the taleban - especially their foreign elements - can still offer fierce local resistance .
and the manhunt for osama bin laden and other al-qaeda leaders is only just beginning .

the election came one week after the outgoing governor , nur misuari , led an amed uprising against government forces .
the turnout has been low , with less than 20 % casting ballots in some areas despite a plea from president gloria arroyo to the 1.3 million voters in the region to support the election .
there have been few reports of violence from muslim rebels .
president arroyo urged voters to turnout our correspondent in autonomous region for muslim mindanao -lrb- armm -rrb- said thousands of extra troops have been deployed , creating an almost suffocating military presence .
he said christians by and large have not bothered to vote - most are opposed to even being part of the armm .
but , he says , the government will be particularly disappointed by the small number of muslims who cast their votes .
some may have been too frightened to come to the polling stations .
others have lost faith in the autonomous region which has done little to improve their lives since its creation five years ago .
insurrection the autonomous region of muslim mindanao was created in 1996 after nur misuari signed a peace accord which ended 25 years of an armed campaign for an independent muslim state .
nur misuari broke a five-year peace agreement with the government mr misuari was elected as governor but he has been widely criticised for corruption and incompetence .
earlier this year his own organisation , the moro national liberation front , voted to replace him as chairman .
last week , mr misuari , broke his five-year-old peace agreement with the government and launched an attack on an army base on the island of jolo in which more than 100 people were killed .
he has since been arrested after fleeing to neighbouring malaysia , easing the tension in the armm a little .
both jolo and basilan have been plagued by the militant abu sayyaf group , which is still holding two americans hostage on basilan .
president arroyo has made ending the conflict in the southern philippines a priority of her administration .
her hope is that a better governor may persuade more rebels to lay down their arms . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jonathan head " democracy in the middle of a war zone " see also : 24 nov 01 -pipe- asia-pacific philippine rebel leader arrested 22 nov 01 -pipe- asia-pacific army hunts for philippines governor 21 nov 01 -pipe- asia-pacific in pictures : philippines uprising 21 nov 01 -pipe- asia-pacific ' over 100 ' dead in philippines uprising 20 nov 01 -pipe- asia-pacific arroyo suspends renegade governor 19 nov 01 -pipe- asia-pacific philippines peace deal broken internet links : office of president arroyo the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : blaze kills 42 in indonesian bar china vows to overhaul courts koreas trade fresh war of words philippines church apologises for sex abuse search for ' spy ' pilots in china chinese chemical spill kills 13 malaysian state passes islamic law vietnam 's unburied soldiers head home links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

the most congested roads , the longest commuting times and some of the highest bus and rail fares can be found in the uk , according to the commission for integrated transport .
transport woes 25 % of main roads jammed for an hour a day average daily commute : 46 mins 87 % of road journeys by car fuel tax highest in europe rail fares third highest in europe transport secretary stephen byers put much of the blame for the state of the railways at the door of railtrack and previous conservative governments .
but he said he accepted this government would be judged on whether it improves the transport system .
professor david begg , chairman of the commission , said the report was a " stark demonstration " of 50 years of neglect and under-investment .
he also said the government 's £ 180bn , 10-year plan for restructuring the uk 's transport system would only start to bridge the gap .
mr byers admitted to the bbc there were major problems with british transport .
but he said he was confident his 10-year plan would overcome them .
' the money is coming through ' he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " the 10-year plan started in april , the money is coming through .
" most investors can see a clear distinction between the failed privatisation that was railtrack and the need to develop public private partnerships for our transport system and the money is coming through and people will see a real difference and i will be content as transport secretary to be judged on those improvements . "
in the commission 's report - the first comprehensive comparison between transport investment in britain and europe - british motorists and passengers come out worst on almost every single count .
the roads were easily the most congested - 25 % of main roads were jammed for at least an hour a day but less than 10 % of the main highways got blocked in germany and france .
the average daily commuting time was 46 minutes while italians , for example , got to work in half the time .
the average british family spent 15 % of its income on transport - again way out of line with most of its european neighbours .
britain remained the most car-dominated country in europe .
eighty seven per cent of road journeys were by car and only 12 % were by public transport .
fuel tax was also the highest in europe , and only denmark and sweden had higher rail fares .
tough decisions the commission was set up in 1999 by john prescott when he was secretary of state for transport , to offer independent advice on the government 's long-term transport plans .
it welcomed the 10-year transport plan , published last year , calling it a " long awaited focus on integrated policies and a step change in levels of investment " .
transport woes ii lowest rail subsidy in europe britons walk less than rest of europe except greece britons cycle less than half the european average coach and bus use in decline but prof begg added : " this report demonstrates what a mountain we have to climb .
" the decisions that we take now as a nation will determine whether we end up with a us-style car culture or a sustainable european multi-model system . "

in the july and september period , malaysia 's economic output , or gdp , contracted by 1.3 % , worse than most economists had expected .
the electronics industry was particularly hard hit , operating at just 62 % of capacity thanks to the consumer spending crunch in the us , the industry 's prime export market .
analysts blamed the situation on a narrowing government deficit , the result of curbs in state spending .
growth for the full year is expected by the government to be 1-2 % , ahead of many predictions but far below the 8.5 % seen in 2000 .

the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , which groups together the world 's most advanced economies , said the uk was better placed to weather the downturn than its other 29 members .
uk economy pros and cons pros : solid growth prospects low unemployment low inflation sound government finances better expenditure planning cons : high external risks over-strong pound too many spending targets low productivity regulatory muddle outmoded company law but the oecd warned that substantial external risks remained , notably the strength of the pound , which makes british exports uncompetitive on world markets .
the report will be a boost to chancellor gordon brown , who is due to present the government 's plans for the economy in his pre-budget report on tuesday .
less welcome , however , will be the oecd 's criticisms of certain aspects of government policy , in particular its reliance on target-based expenditure , and the country 's outmoded laws on business .
in its examination of britain 's business climate , the oecd argued that the uk is still dangerously bureaucratic , and that both public and private sectors were not productive enough .
bouncing back the main headline growth forecasts showed that britain is among the most resilient developed economies , even taking into account the effects of the 11 september attacks .
chancellor gordon brown will be broadly pleased the oecd forecast that the uk 's economic output growth , or gdp , would dip from 2.3 % this year to just 1.7 % in 2002 .
while below the uk 's long-term growth rate of around 2.25 % , the growth figure for 2002 is higher than that other developed economies are thought likely to achieve .
last week , the oecd announced that its members ' economies as a whole were shrinking for the first time in 20 years .
after next year 's dip , the oecd forecasts that the british economy will bounce back to 2.5 % growth in 2003 .
one key element in this rebound will be the value of the pound , which has been extremely strong in recent years , to the chagrin of british exporters .
the oecd agreed that sterling was broadly over-valued , but admitted that manipulating the currency downwards was not in the direct power of central government .
fruits of reform the main cause for this resilience , the oecd argued , was that britain has a largely deregulated economy , with significantly low unemployment .
in addition , it praised mr brown for helping refocus government finances , paving the way for sensible increases in spending that could help cushion the economy in coming months .
and low inflation means that britain can continue to cut interest rates without danger .
in particular , the labour government has placed far more emphasis on long-term economic planning , eliminating the swings previously seen in departmental budgets , monday 's report said .
also , government finances have become more transparent , and anchored by a " golden rule " which insists that spending should be funded through current revenues , while investment can be financed by debt .
reservations remain but the oecd was not whole-hearted in its assessment of government policy .
as regards spending , the report was mildly critical of the government 's addiction to linking expenditure to quantifiable targets , rather than less tangible benefits .
for example , the government has come under fire for targeting reductions in waiting lists in the national health service , while reportedly allowing overall standards to wane .
the oecd recommended that the government strengthen the process under which the effectiveness of spending is audited , as well as provide financial incentives for departments to perform well .
the report was also only cautiously positive about the government 's record in public-private partnerships , which aim to split the cost of major public service projects with the private sector .
although it acknowledged some positive experiences in this area , it counselled that the government should more " carefully weigh the pros and cons " of such agreements .
business problems but the oecd reserved its harshest criticism for britain 's business environment , which it said still lags the government 's ambitions .
" in addition to the need to raise the effectiveness of the public sector , the uk also faces the challenge to increase the low level and modest growth of productivity in the private sector - issues that are intertwined , " the report said .
a separate report pulbished on monday by proudfoot consulting calculated that british firms lose the equivalent of 117 working days each year from time wasted by unproductive workers .
too many conflicting government initiatives have muddied the thrust of policy , and investment in human capital and technology have been insufficient .
as a result , the uk economy is not as open to competition as it should be , the oecd argued , and there are conflicting signals from regulators , resulting in much unnecessary red tape .
risky business although british entrepreneurs face a better environment than their counterparts in many other countries , the report highlighted " various institutional factors that discourage risk-taking . "
setting up businesses in britain remains more difficult than it should be , and the evolution of company law has been worryingly piecemeal .
while the oecd welcomed the government 's plans to shake up company law , it strongly recommended that legal reforms should be combined into a new body of law - in particular , planning rules should be made more business-friendly .

shallow hal it would have to reach that total by tuesday night to take the accolade .
last week , harry potter reached the $ 100m mark in the same amount of time as star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace did two years ago .
a spokesman for film studio warner brothers said he expected harry potter to sustain its success and said the company would have " a huge christmas " .
pirated harry potter dvds are already on sale in some countries warner 's president of distribution dan fellman said : " we had a great weekend .
audiences from eight to 80 are really supporting the movie . "
despite harry potter 's success , overall thanksgiving takings were down from the same time last year , with other films on release performing relatively poorly .
the total earnings from the top 12 films between wednesday and sunday fell 12.6 % from last year , to $ 203m -lrb- £ 143.5m -rrb- .
disney 's computerised animation monsters , inc is still the second most popular film in america , with spy game , starring brad pitt and robert redford , at number three .
monsters inc features the voices of john goodman and billy crystal monsters , inc is set to break through the $ 200m barrier itself , becoming the fifth film this year to earn that amount at american box offices - more than any previous year .
apart from harry potter , this year 's other $ 200m films are shrek , the mummy returns and rush hour 2 .
pirated videos and dvds of harry potter have already appeared on the streets of hong kong and china - weeks before the cinema releases in those countries .
the film is titled harry potter and the philosopher 's stone in the uk .

the rail operator 's collapse means that a track upgrade designed to support the new 125mph trains will not be completed on time .
the trains , capable of cutting the london to glasgow journey time to under four hours , are now not expected to start running at their full speed until may 2003 .
virgin boss sir richard branson was taking delivery of the first of a fleet of 53 high speed trains on monday .
" we 're delivering the new trains on time , but i 'm afraid railtrack has said that the speeds we would like will have to be delayed , hopefully only by a few months , " he told bbc radio four 's today programme .
railtrack management failure news of the setback followed revelations that the financial crisis which caused railtrack 's collapse last month is even more serious than originally thought . "
railtrack has failed to deliver on its part of the agreement , and as a result the travelling public will be frustrated yet again " transport secretary stephen byers transport secretary stephen byers said over the weekend that railtrack 's finances are so tangled that it will take longer than the expected six months for administrators to wind the failed company down .
this pushes back the start-date for new management to take over the job of the collapsed operator and start revamping the uk 's battered rail network .
mr byers blamed the virgin rail setback on railtrack 's " failure to manage the railway system " .
" virgin has got its trains coming out today , but railtrack has failed to deliver on its part of the agreement , and as a result the travelling public will be frustrated yet again , " he told the today programme . £ 3.1bn cash injection needed the department of transport confirmed that railtrack needs a £ 3.1bn -lrb- $ 4.3bn -rrb- cash injection to keep it going over the next few months , up from an original estimate of £ 2.1bn.
mr byers is hoping to replace railtrack with a not-for-profit rail authority , but the defunct rail authority 's former managers say that the government 's decision to declare the company bankrupt will cost more money in the long run . "
we 'll be pressuring the administrators and government to make sure the delay is not for more than a few months " virgin boss sir richard branson the delay in upgrading the west coast main line railway track means that the new trains will not be able to use their " tilting " technology , which enables them to travel around bends faster than conventional trains .
virgin said the trains will go into service on the west coast line next summer , but will only run at 110mph and only between london and north west england .
west midlands and glasgow services - at 110mph - will start in late 2002 , with 125mph tilting services coming in march 2003 .
branson keeps up the pressure sir richard is due to attend a handover ceremony on monday of the first fully-completed train at manufacturer alstom 's washwood heath site near birmingham .
virgin rail plans to lobby the government to ensure that the track upgrade was n't delayed any further .
" we 'll be pressuring the administrators and government to make sure the delay is not for more than a few months , " said sir richard .
virgin has ordered a total of 53 nine-coach tilting trains , at a cost of £ 600m .

the rail operator 's collapse means that a track upgrade designed to support the new 125mph trains will not be completed on time .
the trains , capable of cutting the london to glasgow journey time to under four hours , are now not expected to start running at their full speed until may 2003 .
virgin boss sir richard branson was taking delivery of the first of a fleet of 53 high speed trains on monday .
" we 're delivering the new trains on time , but i 'm afraid railtrack has said that the speeds we would like will have to be delayed , hopefully only by a few months , " he told bbc radio four 's today programme .
railtrack management failure news of the setback followed revelations that the financial crisis which caused railtrack 's collapse last month is even more serious than originally thought .
railtrack has failed to deliver on its part of the agreement , and as a result the travelling public will be frustrated yet again transport secretary stephen byers transport secretary stephen byers said over the weekend that railtrack 's finances are so tangled that it will take longer than the expected six months for administrators to wind the failed company down .
this pushes back the start-date for new management to take over the job of the collapsed operator and start revamping the uk 's battered rail network .
mr byers blamed the virgin rail setback on railtrack 's " failure to manage the railway system " .
" virgin has got its trains coming out today , but railtrack has failed to deliver on its part of the agreement , and as a result the travelling public will be frustrated yet again , " he told the today programme . £ 3.1bn cash injection needed the department of transport confirmed that railtrack needs a £ 3.1bn -lrb- $ 4.3bn -rrb- cash injection to keep it going over the next few months , up from an original estimate of £ 2.1bn.
mr byers is hoping to replace railtrack with a not-for-profit rail authority , but the defunct rail authority 's former managers say that the government 's decision to declare the company bankrupt will cost more money in the long run .
we 'll be pressuring the administrators and government to make sure the delay is not for more than a few months virgin boss sir richard branson the delay in upgrading the west coast main line railway track means that the new trains will not be able to use their " tilting " technology , which enables them to travel around bends faster than conventional trains .
virgin said the trains will go into service on the west coast line next summer , but will only run at 110mph and only between london and north west england .
west midlands and glasgow services - at 110mph - will start in late 2002 , with 125mph tilting services coming in march 2003 .
branson keeps up the pressure sir richard is due to attend a handover ceremony on monday of the first fully-completed train at manufacturer alstom 's washwood heath site near birmingham .
virgin rail plans to lobby the government to ensure that the track upgrade was n't delayed any further .
" we 'll be pressuring the administrators and government to make sure the delay is not for more than a few months , " said sir richard .
virgin has ordered a total of 53 nine-coach tilting trains , at a cost of £ 600m . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's simon montague " tilting trains are already commonplace in europe " transport secretary stephen byers " it is a classic example of railtrack 's failure " sir richard branson " we are delivering the high speed trains on time " talking point travel woes ?

even in its glory days , when it ran an impressive network of flights around the region , air afrique had the occasional wobble .
the french flag carrier is taking over both the name and routes of air afrique , once a proud symbol of african independence .
but ground staff providing services such as cleaning and catering at airports throughout french-speaking west africa want a better deal when the airline goes into liquidation .
having been a frequent flier with air afrique , i have mixed feelings about the airline as it passes into history .
' occasional wobbles ' i used to be an homme d 'affaires , air afrique .
they clearly had not thought of having femmes d 'affaires , but i was n't going to raise feminist objections - having one of their businessman 's cards could be extremely useful .
even in its glory days , when it ran an impressive network of flights around the region , air afrique had the occasional wobble .
there were days when the computer system crashed all along the west african coast , and the check-in staff had absolutely no idea how many seats on the incoming flight were already taken .
there were days when one of the 11 owner governments had pulled rank and commandeered half the plane .
or if the entire paris press corps was fighting to get on the last flight to france for three days , the little bit of green and white plastic could work a bit of magic , and make sure i was the last to get bumped .
once on board , air afrique was usually very comfortable - the hostesses were impeccably elegant , from their swept back hair to their manicured fingernails .
meals came with a choice of a french or african main course , red or white wine , and crisp bread rolls .
past glories but the glory days are long past .
six planes have now been repossessed for non-payment , and hotel reception desks in the region , instead of referring you to the timetable , stick up little hand-written notices to announce that air afrique might be planning to run a flight to paris on friday .
once on board , air afrique was usually very comfortable - the hostesses were impeccably elegant , from their swept back hair to their manicured fingernails on my last two return trips with air afrique , two of the flights were nearly 20 hours late and my luggage got left behind in paris three times .
in senegal for a big un conference i fell foul of the reconfirmation rule - fail to reconfirm 72 hours before your return flight , and the computer automatically wipes out your booking .
this would happen even if the air afrique office had closed by the time you arrived on friday evening and the deadline expired before it reopened on monday morning .
it turned out i was lucky , because i at least knew i had a problem - unlike the hundred of other delegates who turned up at the airport blissfully unaware that their flights had been amalgamated with others or abolished altogether .
by that time i had spent the whole afternoon at the airport , most of it sitting politely but unmoveable on the sofa in the station manager 's office .
he would juggle phones , swallow aspirins , and deal with abusive officials demanding that passengers should be thrown off flights so their ministers could travel .
when mr bah finally found me a boarding pass i paused just long enough to express my undying gratitude , and then fled to get as high up the check-in queue as possible .
patience in adversity by the time i reached the desk , the whole check-in area was a heaving mass of people and luggage - no way i could be sent away to pay for my excess baggage , or i would never have got back again .
when i finally got to the departure lounge i looked back ; a near-riot had broken out when the last boarding pass was issued .
the head of airport security was standing on the check-in counter , trying to calm the mob , as the disappointed passengers - including senior civil servants and un officials - bayed for his blood .
over the years air afrique has taught me patience in adversity , low cunning and the tactical use of a sharp elbow .
my sympathies are with mr bah and his colleagues as they face an uncertain future .
