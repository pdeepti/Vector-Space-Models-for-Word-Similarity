about 100 troops , believed to be members of the special boat service , are there to carry out a fact-finding mission .
defence officials say the troops will be checking out the airport 's facilities in preparation for humanitarian operations .
it is believed they will also be assessing whether conditions are right for the future deployment of more ground troops .
there is no assumption yet that they -lsb- troops on standby -rsb- are definitely going to be deployed mod spokesman the move on thursday coincides with an announcement that the uk is to send its first diplomat to kabul since 1989 following the withdrawal of the taleban regime .
foreign secretary jack straw announced that stephen evans , 51 , would be helping opposition forces to set up a broad-based government .
" taking prompt action is an important way of helping to secure the advances that have already been made during the course of the week , " mr straw said .
news of the british deployment came as tony blair warned the campaign against terrorism was far from over despite his claims that the taleban were near " collapse " .
troops on standby a senior british defence source said on thursday night : " i can confirm that some of our forces are on the ground in northern afghanistan , having arrived at bagram airport at 1200gmt .
" they are to carry out technical tasks in connection with future humanitarian tasks . "
we have clearly considered very carefully the security situation and we are confident that at the moment we can deploy safely to the kabul area stephen evans the special boat service -lrb- sbs -rrb- is the royal marines ' equivalent of the special air service -lrb- sas -rrb- .
last sunday , defence secretary geoff hoon confirmed that british troops were already on the ground in afghanistan .

it is believed the troops which landed on thursday will secure bagram airport and then clear a pathway into the afghan capital for any future aid missions .
bagram aiport , situated about 10 miles north-east of kabul , is considered to be of key strategic importance .
thousands of uk troops will remain on 48-hour standby to go to afghanistan , while the advance party of royal marines assesses the situation on the ground , mod sources said .
frontline duties the units are said to include the whole of 2nd battalion the parachute regiment , the entire 45 commando of the royal marines , and elements from 16 air assault brigade and 3 commando brigade .
mr blair has said they could be used in future frontline offensives against the taleban , although protection of humanitarian supplies and " stabilising " work would be the priority .
an mod spokesman said that although there were a large number of british troops on standby , " there is no assumption yet that they are definitely going to be deployed " .
earlier on thursday , mr blair said the situation in afghanistan was " infinitely better " than a few days ago , despite unconfirmed reports of northern alliance atrocities .
at a news conference in central london the prime minister said that with taleban resistance largely broken the chances of ensuring a stable future government for the war-torn country had improved dramatically .
mr evans , a former lieutenant in the first royal tank regiment , said the security situation had been considered carefully .
" we are confident that at the moment we can deploy safely to the kabul area . "
britain 's previous ambassador to afghanistan left kabul when soviet forces invaded in 1979 .
earlier on thursday , mr straw pronounced himself " relatively optimistic " over the prospect for peace in afghanistan - provided events move swiftly .

the reverend pat sinton is being licensed on friday for the chichester diocese , at shipley , near horsham .
chichester cathedral 's previous bishop consistently refused to carry out licensing and ordinations of women priests .
women however , have been able to work within the diocese , through the approval of the archbishop of canterbury .
it would be right to for me to say he -lrb- bishop eric kemp -rrb- is against the ordination and licensing of women priests chaplain nicholas biddle , chichester cathedral bishop eric kemp , formerly head of the chichester diocese , has been staunchly opposed to the ceremony for women since their appointments were first sanctioned in 1992 .

mr biddle said : " it 's not really for me to comment on the reasons behind his feelings , but it would be right to for me to say he is against the ordination and licensing of women priests .
" because anyone who operates in a diocese in this way needs a license from the bishop , it has meant reverend sinton is the first woman to be licensed directly under the diocese 's name . "
reverend sinton 's licensing is due to take place as part of the eucharist service , the prime act of worship in the christian community .
parishioners ' approval the congregation at the service will witness her renewing her commitment to serving christ .
the chaplain added : " she will also then take the oath of allegiance to the queen .

the highest muslim authority in indonesia , the council of ulemas , has called for all entertainment venues to be closed during ramadan .
but in jakarta the city governor is allowing restaurants and live music halls to operate for reduced hours - except for the six days considered most holy - though it has ordered the closure of all nightclubs and bars .
the jakarta decree did not explicitly ban alcohol , reported the french news agency afp .
muslims must refrain from eating , drinking , smoking and sex each day from dawn to dusk during ramadan .
disagreement there is confusion however over whether the holy month starts on friday or saturday .
the government announced late on thursday that ramadan would start on saturday .
the previous day the religious affairs minister had reportedly said it would begin on friday .
the start of ramadan , the ninth month in the islamic lunar calendar , is determined either by the sighting of the new moon or through astronomical calculations .
several islamic groups and the religious affairs ministry said the new moon was not sighted on thursday evening and therefore ramadan starts on saturday .
other groups use astronomical calculations , and still say ramadan started on friday in indonesia .
threats the president of the council of ulemas , dien syamsuddin , told the bbc that his group would not tolerate violent action and it was up to the government to implement law and order .
the fpi opposes us military action in afghanistan muhammad riziq shihab , chairman of the front for the defenders of islam -lrb- fpi -rrb- , said his group had printed 200,000 stickers which read : " burn any vicious places that open during ramadan . "
the british embassy in jakarta warned uk citizens to take special care during ramadan .
the fpi have recently threatened to " sweep " for foreigners in protest at us-led attacks on afghanistan .
the group , which the bbc 's richard galpin says has a reputation for attacking bars and nightclubs , has demanded an end to diplomatic relations with washington over the military action . watch / listen on this story dien syamsuddin , council of ulemas " we do n't tolerate any violent action " see also : 15 nov 01 -pipe- asia-pacific analysis : indonesia 's islamic radicals 26 oct 01 -pipe- asia-pacific indonesian islamists hold fire 25 sep 01 -pipe- asia-pacific indonesia clerics threaten jihad 19 sep 01 -pipe- asia-pacific islamic groups warn of indonesia violence 14 sep 01 -pipe- americas islam : faith under fire internet links : interactive - fragile archipelago the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : blaze kills 42 in indonesian bar china vows to overhaul courts koreas trade fresh war of words philippines church apologises for sex abuse search for ' spy ' pilots in china chinese chemical spill kills 13 malaysian state passes islamic law vietnam 's unburied soldiers head home links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

disagreement there is confusion however over whether the holy month starts on friday or saturday .
the government announced late on thursday that ramadan would start on saturday .
the previous day the religious affairs minister had reportedly said it would begin on friday .
the start of ramadan , the ninth month in the islamic lunar calendar , is determined either by the sighting of the new moon or through astronomical calculations .
several islamic groups and the religious affairs ministry said the new moon was not sighted on thursday evening and therefore ramadan starts on saturday .
other groups use astronomical calculations , and still say ramadan started on friday in indonesia .
threats the president of the council of ulemas , dien syamsuddin , told the bbc that his group would not tolerate violent action and it was up to the government to implement law and order .
muhammad riziq shihab , chairman of the front for the defenders of islam -lrb- fpi -rrb- , said his group had printed 200,000 stickers which read : " burn any vicious places that open during ramadan . "
the british embassy in jakarta warned uk citizens to take special care during ramadan .
the fpi have recently threatened to " sweep " for foreigners in protest at us-led attacks on afghanistan .
the group , which the bbc 's richard galpin says has a reputation for attacking bars and nightclubs , has demanded an end to diplomatic relations with washington over the military action .

the firm , which also runs old navy and banana republic stores , has suffered a lengthy deterioration in results , owing to a slowing us market and its failure to keep up with changing consumer tastes .
but industry experts said that gap may have turned the corner , citing its improved control over costs and better inventory management .
gap shares barely eased on the news , but have lost almost half their value over the past 12 months .
into loss gap said its net loss for the third quarter was $ 179m - including a previously announced $ 131m tax charge - compared with a profit of $ 186m in the same period of 2000 .
excluding the tax charge , gap posted a loss of $ 48m , driven primarily by a decline in margins and weaker sales .
revenues for the quarter fell 2.2 % to $ 3.3bn , while sales at stores open at least one year - a key measure of retail growth - tumbled 17 % .
while the loss was deeper than most analysts had expected , the markets were cheered by the news that capital expenditures were $ 760m , around half their level a year earlier .
this means that the retailer is achieving its announced plan to scale back on new store openings and review its existing property arrangements .
gap 's store footage grew by only 20 % in the quarter , compared with 32 % a year earlier .
gap 's goals gap president and chief executive millard drexler said in a statement that the company 's goals are to restore same-store sales and earnings performance by " tightly managing our business and focusing on the fundamentals .
" our priorities are controlling costs , strengthening margins , and getting the product right for our customers , " mr drexler said .
with most other issues in the business now under tighter control , this last aim is now the retailer 's main target , analysts said .

as the chancellor , gordon brown , puts the finishing touches to his pre-budget report , he will probably have half an eye on next summer 's public spending review .
the government argues that to put up taxes now while the economy is slowing would be ill-advised .
this will set spending levels for services like health and education for most of the rest of this parliament , and will be a key factor in the government 's prospects for re-election .
but mr brown may soon face some difficult choices as he tries to juggle the public sector 's demands for more cash with the worsening economic situation and labour 's manifesto pledge not to raise income tax .
taxing speculation there has been much speculation that spending and revenue problems over the slowing economy and the cost of war will empty the government 's coffers and force it to put up taxes .
it is certainly true that the government 's own projections see the budget surplus disappear over the next few years .
last year 's Â£ 16bn surplus on public borrowing will turn into a Â£ 10bn deficit by 2003 .
but mr brown 's self-imposed fiscal rules are unlikely to be breached , as they allow him to dip into the red for a few years provided he has built up reserves .
labour was rattled by anger over public services in effect , the surpluses accrued earlier in the parliament are allowing him to run up debts now .
even a military campaign as expensive as the Â£ 2.5bn spent on the gulf war in 1991 would not jeopardise this .
the government 's finances are hardly running onto the rocks .
public sector net debt fell 10 % last year to 31.7 % of gdp .
it was 44.4 % at the 1997 election .
the government argues that to put up taxes now while the economy is slowing would be ill-advised .
it would also go against the thrust of current monetary policy , which is to encourage consumers to keep on spending by slashing interest rates .
changing situation but the situation could well change over the next few years , as the economy picks up and holes start to appear in the public finances .
the institute for fiscal studies says the government will need to raise taxes by Â£ 5bn each year in order to maintain growth in public spending at its current rate of 3.7 % a year in the coming spending round , which covers the three years from 2003/04 .
this is equivalent to nearly 2p on income tax .
labour was rattled during the june election campaign by public anger at its failure to match promises on services with results .
although spending on health and education is now rising at its fastest rate since the 1970s , it has only been doing so for the past two years .
spending before then was kept on a tight rein .
a result of this earlier parsimony is that service chiefs are actually unable to spend the money they have belatedly been allocated .
the railways revamp is an expensive pledge peter robinson , an economist at the left-leaning think-tank , the institute for public policy research , warns that the government will need to raise spending by a lot faster than its current rate if it is to meet its long-term political targets .
for example , on current trends it will take until 2011 for health spending to achieve tony blair 's aspiration of matching the european average .
other un-costed and probably very expensive pledges include expanding higher education to 50 % of school leavers , new anti-poverty tax credits and the revamp of the railways .
the latter will have been further complicated by the government 's recent take-over of railtrack .
satisfying public demand mr robinson warns : " even if the government does deliver its spending commitments , will this satisfy public demand ? "
labour ruled out increases in the basic or higher rate of income tax during the general election campaign .
but there are plenty of other ways to raise money .
a front-runner , at least in the press , would be to raise or abolish the upper earnings limit of national insurance .
abolition would raise Â£ 4bn or so , and brown has refused to rule it out .
brown has not ruled out national insurance changes but tapping the national insurance fund is problematical .
michael jacobs , of the fabian society , said : " in my view the government should not raise taxes by increasing national insurance contributions .
" ni is an earmarked social insurance system .
contributions are paid into the ni fund , which should be used only for ni purposes - the basic state pension and some other benefits .
" any changes to fund general government spending would alter the basis of this social contract and would not be transparent . "
another good way of boosting the income tax take is simply not to raise the tax thresholds by very much , so that rising earnings push more people in higher tax brackets .
economists call this " fiscal drag " , and it accounts for a sizeable proportion of the rise in the tax burden so far under labour .

the series looks at the creatures who roamed the earth after the dinosaurs had been blitzed by a comet or asteroid , and like its predecessor , it is full of digital special effects .
" like its dinosaur forerunner , this programme has been lavished with technology to make it stand alone .
but the sore fact remains that it is all make-believe and rather like a virtual wildlife programme without the real blood , sweat and smells , " says the bbc 's michael osborn .
but what do you think ?
is it as good as dinosaurs ?
or do you think it is a case of style over substance ?
have your say with the evidence collected and the fact that these animals no longer exist , i personally found walking with beasts very good and the animation was quite impressive considering the amount of facts the crew had .
it 's a shame that some people here seem to want the moon on a stick .
karen picton , england brilliantly done and it looks so real .
i would like it to be an hour long , as you just get into it and it finishes .
more !
summy , scotland superb !
highly realistic ; my young son is convinced they 're all for real !
thought there was rather too much hype though .
beasts makes a very welcome change from the usual bbc schedule .
barry , uk sesame street directed by quentin tarantino mike , uk i found it a great delight , i have a large screen and surround sound and it was like sitting in the jungle !
ca n't wait for the next instalment .
keep up the good work .
roger deacon , england i watched the programme in full and at first did not think much of the original narrator though the animation was splendid .
later realising that you can watch the programme 24/7 on ibbc digital , i viewed the programme once again but this time with the alternative in-depth narrator .
i personally found this to be of a very high standard and rich with information .
much better !
the interaction enabled you to access evidence and facts whilst viewing , which was astonishing and shows once again the bbc leading the way forward in technology .
can not wait for more programmes in ibbc and the long awaited bbc news 24 interactive .
alister , uk impressive as ever !
hazel , uk bbc , you have outdone yourself again , first walking with dinosaurs , then blue planet , now this masterpiece .
truly outstanding work .
i loved walking with beasts although i was very disappointed that digital viewers got a lot more action - do they pay more for their licence than me ?
keep up the good work - well done .
rolando johnston , wales i like walking with beasts more than walking with dinosaurs because the beasts are like the next form of dinosaurs .
also , the dinosaurs only had dinosaurs in it , while the beasts have monkeys , giant ants and people .
jack d-j , england i loved it .
more please .
jalil ahmed , uk very good start , it is not as good as the blue planet though .
however , i will not miss a episode if i can as it is very interesting and put together brillantly .
robin e. west , uk i enjoyed the programme very much and found the animation quite incredible .
however , the producers must be cautious in their approach to using half-facts .
dinosaurs was great but essentially fictional with a breath of reality whereas blue planet was quite simply the best documentary i have ever seen .
i am expecting this show to mirror dinosaurs which is a shame because without kenneth brannagh , " head shots " and half-truths it could be fantastic !
nick , uk quite simply fantastic !
this is where digital television finally lives up to all the promises !
as for some people gripping on about the simplistic narration , well , on digital tv you had a choice and tons more interesting science and information , so go out and get yourself a digibox , sky and itv digital are still giving them away free !
gary fowler , uk the beeb has just shown us how the future and present of interactive tv can be done , regardless of the " factual " elements .
this show should make sky sit up and take notice !
tim simmons , uk well done , the beeb !
loved the drama of it all .
the funniest moment was when one of those primates rubbed noses with one of the other primates , complete with a very human kissing sound .
had to rewind the video to make sure i 'd heard right .
zig , uk excellent programming , as dinosaurs before .
it seems a little rushed this time and has great inconsistencies of style .
some animation is fantastic while other movement appears jerky and unreal .
overall image sometimes gives the impression of very small -lrb- toy-like -rrb- animals while other shots are almost cinematic in their quality .
i agree with the digtv comments , true interactive viewing .
woods , uk i watched walking with beasts last night and thought it was excellent for both adults and kids !
obviously it does n't hold the same fascination that the public still has with dinosaurs , but it was truly amazing to watch creatures , such as the one the whale descended from that you would otherwise have no ideaabout .
money well spent , and technology very well used .
joni , uk overall i thought it was great , although the shaky narration did let it down .
i would have loved to have seen the extras on digital , but for all my repeated pressing of the blue button nothing happened .
seems i missed out there .
this programme is obviously more fun than fact , but as long as you accept it as such there should n't be any problem with that .
anthony , uk superb effects , it equals walking with dinosaurs .
debbie boote , uk excellent programme , but why are the interactive features only available to sky viewers ?
i have cable from telewest and pressing the red button did nothing .
like blue planet , and walking with dinosaurs , the programme was great , and you really get the benefit of digital wide screen tvs .
antony , uk this programme was great entertainment and i did actually learn a little about the type of creatures that inhabited the post-dinosaur era .
however i feel that the bbc should back this series up with a factual indepth science programme , to satify those who want to know more .
greg , uk tales from the riverbank for the now generation .
dumb , pseudoscience for the gullible or for animation freaks .
at least the music 's better than wild africa .
karen , uk the programme was entertaining , but for me that is its downfall .
in contrast , dinosaurs was fascinating - that 's an enormous qualitative difference .
i appreciate that animating fur and feathers is a greater challenge than animating reptilian-skin , but the fur animation was n't what let this programme down - it was poorly observed movement which glared out most significantly for me .
surely it would have been no great task to use footage of an equivalent-sized real animal as the basis for the animations , and simply change the detail and features ?
r a coldbreath , uk the truth is that any programme - such as walking with beasts - that brings prehistory to life is going to be full of speculation .
accept this and the programme is as beautiful as it is entertaining .
any soul who seriously believes every single thing they see on tv needs their head examined .
phil yorke , england narration was very poor and was over dramatic .
visual effects were poor compared with what can be done today .
movement of beasts was very unrealistic and did not flow right .
all my friends were looking forward to this and all were very disappointed .
aran porter , uk i was very underwhelmed .
sadly , not the same impact as walking with dinosaurs .
shaun stoker , scotland amazing programme , feel very left out not having digital tv .
i still pay the same licence though and it seems a little unfair .
chris kimberley , england absolutely great !
for accuracy 's sake , i think it 's very difficult to be 100 % correct since these animals lived millions of years ago and of course it is only natural that some guess-work is involved .
i love bbc programmes such as these .
please keep up the good work .
i only wish it was programmed earlier since we are one hour ahead of uk .
lucette joseph , belgium i thought last night 's first episode of walking with beasts was fantastic , superbly portraying a sizeable chunk of our natural history which to most is unknown and neglected .
however , i do feel that a lot of viewers will be more engaged by the mightier beasts which will appear later on , just as with the walking with dinosaurs series .
for a vast majority of the programme you could n't help but think , " i did n't think there were any of those creatures still alive to film ! " , the scenes , camera-work and creatures were so incredibly realistic .
i ca n't wait for the models to go on my desk at work .
brilliant .
daniel fowler , england one word - impressive !
alexander alexeev , uk -lrb- russian -rrb- science fiction - in fact 10 % science fact , 90 % science fiction .
take the supposed ancestor of the whale for example - the ambulocetus .
here are the problems with that assumption from the fossilised bones that were actually found - a -rrb- the skeleton is incomplete , with critical parts supporting the ' whale ' claims missing - pelvis , forelimbs , hemerus and scapula plus other features are missing. b -rrb- the robust femur and prescence of a hoof suggest ambulacetus was a land-dwelling creature. c -rrb- the ambulacetus was found in ' lower to middle eocene beds .
fossils of whales of the suborder archeoceti have been found in lower eocene strata , so ambulacetus is unlikely to be an ancestor of modern whales .
jon miles , uk re the comments about " facts " .
if anyone commenting has actually been to the times that this programme covers then they can harp on about " facts " .
otherwise , shut up and do n't watch .
a vast majority of " facts " about this era are based on supposition and deduction , and just because they are not " facts " you like , does not make them invalid .
simon , uk great animation , very realistic .
however i find the style of the programme to be over dramatic and it tends to personify the animals .
the narrator makes many statements about the behaviour etc of the animals but at no point in the programme does he say that some of the infomation is mere speculation .
the programme would be more successful as a factual documentary rather than a narrated childish " story " .
john simper , uk simply the best .
ron duncan , uk i ca n't believe the derogatory comments about the style and and content of this fantastic programme .
if only the other 23 hours a day of tv could be as good .
mark , england i thought this was very good as far as it went .
as others have said , the animation of fur and feathers is not as easy as lizard skin , this became apparent very early on .
i agreed with erik bean , i am sure that was the same sequence day and night with different colouration .
i do n't agree with alistair currah , i believe the environment shown would have been a noisy place .
the problem with this as it did not go far enough for anyone wanting to understand the known facts and how what was represented was achieved .
i do n't know what was on the digital extras as i do n't have digital , but a few extra pop-ups as the programme goes on are not what i would be looking for .
i will be watching next week .
will , uk beasts took me to a magical world , it was inspiring and interesting .
of course its accuracy is only down to the guestimates of scientists !
daniel philpott , england i 've seen more convincing glove puppets !
jonathan jones , england fantastic !
wonderfully produced , and incredibly beautiful .
i only wish the rest of tv was this good .
ashley penney , uk i thought the effects were disappointing .
previous comments highlighting the animals ' apparent ' zero mass ' are absolutely right - this is a perennial and unresolved problem with animation , and whilst the creatures in the programme have evolved in comparison with dinosaurs , i think the bbc 's animation has regressed .
james , england absolutely brilliant .
wish i had watched walking with dinosaurs now .
ken mclachlan , scotland good animation but again , creative speculation distributed as fact .
jurassic park did it better and was more accurate james murphy , uk ten out of ten .
just wish they would put it on earlier .
my kids wanted to stay up to watch it and we let them , now they 're like half cut knives this morning .
ruaridh shuttleworth , scotland wow !
love the effects lauren , uk i watched part of it and turned over , some of the assumptions were astounding - ' we know its true because we 've just made it up ' .
please let this be the last .
dene , england sesame street directed by quentin tarantino .
mike , uk great - only one gripe , which is being hammered by adverts for the bbc 's digital service .
i live in an area which can not receive digital tv and , as such , i do not wish to know what fantastic things i could have access to -lrb- more information , different narration , further interesting content -rrb- , if only i could get digital tv .
sarah , reading , uk fantastic !
what a magical journey back in time .
what irony that such exciting beasts have evolved into such slothful couch potatoes .
mother nature must be aghast !
dr. simon hill , uk i thought it was excellent - there had to be a certain amount of artistic licence as we will never really know exactly what the animals were like .
the research and animation were fantastic and most certainly on a par with walking with dinosaurs .
amanda , uk although the original narration was found to be a little patronising by some , the in-depth version available via bbci on digital tv made the programme much more enjoyable .
as the first interactive bbc broadcast i was very impressed and look forward to the next episode .
being able to switch between streams was useful and not at all distracting since it was repeated several times and you could take different routes throughout the programme .
chris phillips , essex , uk i was most impressed by the digital programme available through digital tv straight after the show .
extras were most interesting and informative and i found the more detailed commentary most impressive .
andy fowler , uk beasts is a snapshot of opinion in time which is highly entertaining and informative - i hope the bbc are really proud of this dave , uk great effects !
but seriously if you look beneath them we have a seriously dumbed down programme .
where has the science gone ?
come on bbc , please give people more qualified facts and not speculation !
graham p , uk i watched this on sky digital and what a difference , the standard commentary could be swapped for a much more interesting in depth version and the evidence and making of options superb .
i kept on watching to try and catch it all and almost missed question time .
digital tv comes of age and i ca n't wait until next week .
steve , uk i thought the programme was fun and slightly educational .
i thought the models and graphics good , although the horse things did n't really look like they were eating the grapes .
i thought the narration was good enough and the screen facts on itv digital filled in the gaps and provided some interesting facts , but why ca n't itv digital viewers have the scientific commentary as well ?
a lot of people below have commented on the speculations made in the programme .
well to be honest , this is n't the sort of programme that i 'd expect to be 100 % facutally correct .
it 's not really a documentary and should n't be watched as such , it 's " faction " .
i see it as a sort of beginners guide to paelentology , and if you liked what you watched and want to know more then go and read a book .
also the screen facts did hint at what was speculation and what was fact , eg the horses eating the grapes was based on the preserved stomach contents of one fossil .
not sure about their drunken antics though !
overall a good effort by the bbc and i 'd much rather have these semi-documentaries than those annoying docu-soaps any day .
jonathan , uk very impressive .
as for basis in fact , so what ? !
i feel only the scientific community cares that much about what colour they were .
beasts is a snapshot of opinion in time which is highly entertaining and informative .
i hope the bbc are really proud of this .
dave , uk unrealistic , simplistic , not a patch on walking with dinosaurs - a veneer of style with little content to stiffen it .
nn , england i got so fed up with advert after advert for this .
between programmes in other programmes , i turned over and watched top gear , but not before the announcer mentioning it was starting on the other side .
there must a point where this saturation of advertisments becomes detrimental ?
rick burt , uk of course it 's a " virtual wildlife programme " , these creatures do n't exist anymore !
this is as good as we can currently get to showcasing what nature might have been like during this long lost period .
damian elsen , uk eye candy definitely , but ken brannagh sounds like he is reading his shopping list .
he just ca n't hold the attention like david attenborough .
paul wilkinson , england tacky and irritating in that a fascinating subject matter has been turned into a disneyesque farce .
and that narration !
i 'll probably watch the next episode , but only to see if there 's any improvement .
if not , i wo n't bother with it .
let 's have more real science , bbc , and less fairytale stuff .
graeme , uk let 's face it , this is no more than the muppet show for the computer age abe , scotland excellent in some ways but there was criticism of walking with dinosaurs and the producers of this sequel listened to none of them .
the overdramatic narration is laughable , the prediction of behaviour -lrb- by simply mapping that of modern day animals occupying the same ecological niche -rrb- is grating , and the animation is patchy -lrb- small animals good , big animals bad -rrb- .
however , this is about the first documentary to cover this period of evolution that i am aware of - much needed .
steve johnson , uk luckily i have digital satellite so was able to enjoy the more detailed narration , but i did occasionally switch to the regular voiceover to hear the difference .
a few years ago we might have expected the detailed commentary to be the kind of narration we would hear on a bbc documentary .
now with world-wide sales more of an issue than the home market and the continued dumbing down in bbc1 documentaries eg the lightweight and sensationalist missed opportunity that was space .
walking with beasts was a good show , but needlessly stripped of educational value by a narrative structure more based on anthropomorphism and emotive sentiment .
can we have our intelligent bbc back please , for those without digital satellite ?
harry neary , uk regarding the graphics , the mixture of real settings and animal footage , computer generated imagery and animatronics is a bold one - and it does n't entirely work .
the faux wildlife documentary works , but is mixed with over dramatic shots that ruin the illusion .
the animation , as with dinosaurs , seems a little unrealistic , the creatures appearing slightly sluggish and weightless .
all in all though , the graphics are very high standard for tv .
mtm , england let 's face it , this is no more than the muppet show for the computer age , and to that end it is enjoyable .
however , the presentation of guess work and fiction as historical fact is dishonest .
abe , scotland like walking with dinosaurs , this involves so much speculation as to make it almost fictional .
the effects were n't even as good as the predecessor , i 'm afraid .
not impressed .
trevor blayney , n.ireland beasts is bound to generate the same criticisms as its forebear , but this is to miss the point of this type of documentary .
it has been repeatedly stated by the programme 's producers that this is not an exercise in scientific broadcasting - this is n't going to mislead anybody .
the comments above make it clear that people recognise that it is n't real .
if the style was more evidentially-based , we 'd just have a paleontology programme with good graphics - as the walking with dinosaurs specials showed , these are indeed often better programmes than the series itself , but the series are not designed with the same aims in mind .
walking with beasts , and dinosaurs , are fantasies , speculations about the way the world might have been , and that 's what they should be .
as for the programme itself , the animation on the mammals was generally good , the bird very poor and the close-ups of both looked too much like taxidermists ' specimens to be convincing as living animals .
more seriously , given that this is a series intended to show the development of mammals into modern forms , the selection of animals ranged from inadequate , such as the absence of bats -lrb- especially well-known from the messel site the programme purported to visit -rrb- and pangolins , to downright misleading , as with the brief shot of a pair of tamanduas , south american anteaters in the xentarthan mammal group , which has never existed in germany .
p bowles , uk well , initially expected more quality from the programme , but after viewing the documentary for the first 5 minutes , i could n't resist more .
last year i saw the same series with dinosaurs and other beasts , it is good to see the animation and the realistic screenplay .
satya sk j , uk another triumph of style over content by the bbc .
they give us a massively hyped series crammed full of computer-generated species in a primetime bbc1 slot , whilst relegating the spectacular wild africa series to bbc2 .
one contains beautifully-shot images from one of the most beautiful places on earth , whilst the other gives us sub-jurassic park rubbish , suitable perhaps for those still young enough to glean some entertainment from such baseless wanderings , but the more discerning viewer prefers to have something tangible to watch .
time after time , real-life footage will win out in my household over flashy , over-hyped special effects .
rich beadnall , uk rich beadnall - what do you expect the bbc to do ?
genetically recreate these dead species ?
have some imagination .
martin harvey , uk very enjoyable show and very impressive graphics .
however , the fact they were graphics was certainly more noticeable than with the previous walking with dinosaurs .
indeed , i also feel that you the programme is attempting to cover too much of the evolution timetable .
although , i stand to be corrected and i look forward to next week 's episode .
ian nockolds , england brilliant animation ruined by dumbed down janet and john commentary .
i know you can get more info on digital but i find the bbc 's attitude insulting .
steve windsor , england another winner - i thought it was excellent .
martyn key , uk beasts is another wonderful production .
however , like dinosaurs , the animals tend to be a bit " cutesy " and seem capable of pulling sad / happy / worried faces .
they also seem very noisy .
hunted animals , and indeed hunting animals , do not make the cacaphony these seemed to .
roaring only depletes the energy reserves needed to outrun your chaser , or catch your prey .
all in all though , a very entertaining programme .
alistair currah , uk great show , but the commentary left a little to be desired - far too much ' ah , look at the cute furry animals ' and not enough evidence of how they know about the creatures and their environment .
the interactive features are excellent though , especially the more in-depth soundtrack -lrb- which should have been on the proper showing in my opinion -rrb- - but why ca n't i watch the show with the scientific soundtrack in full screen ?
lee , uk i think it was just as good as walking with dinosaurs : the earlier series was high quality , lowbrow nonsense too .
it bothers me quite a bit that the programme was presented as scientific fact .
the popularity of programmes like this is symptomatic of a society that embraces woolly quasi-mystical mumbo-jumbo like feng shui , and reacts with horror to scientific advances like the human genome project .
i sometimes feel i 'm living through the middle ages again , surrounded by flat-earthers .
let 's hope the bbc presents some popular , intelligent and accurate science soon , or a generation raised on television will always confuse supposition with fact .
russell jones , manchester , uk very good programme - watched part of the " regular " commentary before switching to the " indeph " commentary on interactive .
the indepth commentary gave a lot more information and focused more on what is known through research rather than cute speculation .
good interactive features through out and after the programme .
vic , uk good as entertainment , but the programme and the web ite are dreadful as education .
just looking at gastornis , we get gems such as " ... must have been a silent ambush hunter " -lrb- web site -rrb- is there truly no other possible explanation , such as scavenger , or is this the most likely explanation ?
then we are told that the giant bill was used for a " ... more sinister purpose " -lrb- website -rrb- , implying that predation in the animal kingdom is somehow immoral .
the bbc needs to take much more care over the way supposition and speculation are presented if it is trying to present this work as science .
gary evans , uk the programme was very enjoyable , but as with walking with dinosaurs , the commentary seemed to suffer from a lot of hearsay rather than fact .
fortunately we have digital tv and were able to switch to the alternative commentary , which was much better .
the other interactive services also added a lot to the programme .
justin hughes , reading , uk really really good .
i thoroughly enjoyed it , only wish it was on longer !
lisa finnegan , uk the main concept of this episode was that birds ruled the world yet we only saw one species .
this one was flightless - were all the others able to fly and flew off when the cameramen appeared ?
simon heffer , uk as the programme is done in the same style and format as dinosaurs , i think it was -lrb- and will be -rrb- just as good - it 's a winning formula and a great idea as a follow-up .
stuart , uk commission more programmes that will question , challenge and stimulate , not present us with a half-baked cartoon with an ill conceived storyline t mathews , uk i watched walking with dinosaurs and loved every moment , so much that i bought it on dvd .
i 'm a fan of the beeb 's innovative way of approaching unusual nature documentaries , like the truly incredible alien empires -lrb- insects -rrb- and the blue planet .
i could n't be happier with the first episode of walking with beasts , one of the most interesting and least known periods of earth 's history .
brimming with information , ideas , and concepts ; presented with infectious enthusiasm , how can one not feel the spine tingle when the narrator intones - with a detectable impish glee - " this is a world in which birds eat horses " .
i already know i 'll be watching the subsequent episodes , safe in the knowledge they 'll be of the same quality .
the walking with ... series attempt the impossible : to give us humans today a sense of the sheer scale and variety of pre-history , it simultaneously grips and humbles the viewer .
genuine thanks to all production crew involved - you are leading and teaching the world !
awesome stuff .
maartin , nederlands -lrb- british -rrb- the digitally generated creatures were amazingly ' realistic ' , but , i 'm sorry to say , i just was n't particularly interested in the narrative .
phil steer , england walking with beasts was an entertaining ramble - however , will this mark the future of wildlife documentaries ?
what with the amount of endangered species in the world , will the bbc , say in fifty years time , be filming walking with pandas ?
jon , uk i loved the programme and found it entertaining and really believable .
even better than the dinosaurs .
jane newman , uk wow !
love the effects .
this looks to be a very good series .
lauren , uk i thought that it was absolutely rubbish !
the effects were pathetic , the close up models looked too plasticy and the sounds were a shambles .
the bbc is just trying to make as much money from an old idea as possible .
the movements in dinosaurs were not too bad , but in this they were completely pathetic - i had to switch over .
harry , uk i thought it was enthralling and fascinating but i found it very annoying that theories were presented as fact .
some of the " facts " stated with absolute confidence in the show are highly disputed .
george , slough , uk " all make-believe ... "
i would n't agree with that .
it sounds like it should be treated as a work of fiction .
the science behind it is rooted in fact and reason .
although it may not be 100 % correct , that is still not the same as it being a work of fiction and " all make-believe " .
maybe the underlying facts and reason are not put forward enough ?
i think the reason why scientists think the way they do is often missing in science programmes such as walking with beasts .
it is not just a case of looking at a fossil and then dreaming up a beast .
there is a process of examining multiple facts , each with multiple explanations , and finding the common explanation that ties them all together , sort of like the way a detective solves a crime or the way a sceptic thinks about ufos .
it is the facts and the thinking that makes this more than fiction .
andrew wallace , sweden i really enjoyed the first episode .
it was a shame though that only sky digital had the option of choosing which voiceover to have , as i would have liked to have heard the other factual commentary .
i hope the dvd contains both options when it is produced .
as to complaints about accuracy , what do people expect ?
these animals have been extinct for millenia and all praise to the teams involved for putting together such an interesting programme with such little information .
keep it up .
chris , uk the bbc has obviously spent huge amounts of our money on what will doubtless be a very popular series .
however , the " small dinosaur eaten by big dinosaur " storyline has been done to death now .
do us all a favour , dyke , and commission more programmes that will question , challenge and stimulate , not present us with a half-baked cartoon with an ill conceived storyline .
t mathews , uk more a case of hype over quality .
some of the scenes were very poor .
in one it looked as if frames had been removed as the little creature jumped .
andrew puto , uk very interesting , i 've often wondered how the post-dinosaur world started out .
i commend the bbc for bringing science to life , even if a lot of artistic licence has been used to achieve it .
martin holmes , uk finally a programme that justifies digital tv rb , uk i was disappointed with this production , it was a poor attempt at a documentary on the beasts as if they were actually alive and being filmed .
the animals were personified far too much .
the little family of kangaroo mice things were almost comical in the way they were reacting to each other and their surroundings , almost as if they were theme park characters dressed up to entertain children .
you would have thought that the animators of the animals had never even seen a wild animal before .
let alone studied their interactions .
it was almost as if the animals were having conversations with each other .
animals that do n't talk rely on body language to communicate mood and intent , none of which was evident in the animals featured in the show .
if the makers of the show were intending to make a cute fictitious story for children to enjoy , they probably did a good job .
as a nature documentary , it did n't convince me .
alex dale , uk i was disappointed .
the creatures ' behaviour and characteristics were not researched to the same level to those featured in dinosaurs .
because of that , wild guesses have been made , guesses which seem to be somewhat romantic rather than boring and serious .
if it 's worth doing , do it properly .
robbo , england finally a programme that justifies digital tv , and shows how it can be used to genuinely enhance a show , even if you could only get the full effect on sky .
after about 5 minutes we switched over to the much better in depth soundtrack and then at the end watched the re-run of the programme with the evidence , which really was a different programme in its own right .
is it as good as walking with dinosaurs ?
no - it is much better .
the lack of nauseating commentary -lrb- or at least being able to switch to an alternative -rrb- makes it worthy of being called a science programme rather than entertainment .
rb , uk fantastic effects and graphics , let down by a script unnecessarily dramatised and full of clichÃ©s .
i would liked to have seen a few more facts supporting their interpretation of this ancient world .
martin , uk i never subscribed to the swooning over dinosaurs myself .
if you ignored the admittedly wonderful pictures and concentrated on the commentary , it was cod-science of the worst sort .
i happened to turn on beasts last night , and the first thing i heard ?
" such and such is a mammal , and therefore spends a lot of time looking after her brood . "
the only person who could reliably attest to this is doctor who , and i did n't see his name in the end credits .
it seems to me that these sorts of programmes fall between two stools - science and entertainment - and end up being unsatisfactory on both counts .
the makers should either make a feature film with these animals as the stars -lrb- a la a bug 's life -rrb- or write a reliable and accurate commentary .
for instance , " such and such is a mammal , and therefore it is quite likely that she spends a lot of time looking after her brood . "
picky maybe , but then science is picky .
edward , uk will they oust harry potter ?
jerry hughes , england it was absolutely a case of style over substance .
that in itself is n't a problem , but the programme masquerades as " natural history " .
it is n't , it 's speculation .
if there was more of an admission of this , then i would respect the programme more .
until then , i 'll stick to the much more exciting blue planet - real animals are more fascinating .
andy cotgreave , uk well paced , excellently produced with clear but not obtrusive narration .
the first programme kept not only 10 and 12-year-old children of this household , but also adults enthralled - and that was before we reviewed everything again on digital !
the extra information on the digital channel , ranging from the making of , supporting evidence and modern day corollaries was truly superb .
the potential of this form of tv is massive both in education and entertainment terms and the bbc should be congratulated for excellent use of this media .
in comparison to walking with dinosaurs , this series looks to be a step up in terms of narration , information available -lrb- if you have digital -rrb- and graphics -lrb- the movements of the animals is so realistic , it is as if they have been filmed live in the wild - although the faces of the miniature horses did look a bit like cuddly toys ! -rrb-
undoubtedly the video and dvd versions of this will find their way onto christmas lists world wide - perhaps even furry models of these extinct animals will make it there too - but will they oust harry potter ?
well done the bbc !
jerry hughes , england the kids and i loved it , although i do find the factual presentation of what is supposition difficult to latch on to at times .
stuart e , uk very good , but the frequent prompts in the interactive version were annoying .
it was better watching it normally .
colin denholm , uk very enjoyable .
the graphics were unbelievable and sometimes you had to remind yourself they were computer graphics , not real animals .
but this does n't take away from the learning factor .
if anything it helps it in getting people interested and then intrigued in the animal life of so long ago .
excellent work , it would always be hard to live up to dinosaurs as they have always had the public interest but walking with beasts is a worthy follow up - well done .
gerard mclaughlin , n.ireland i loved dinosaurs and hoped that beasts could live up to the standards set by its predecessor .
if the first episode is anything to go by , me , and i suspect millions of others , wo n't be disappointed .
awe inspiring stuff once again .
i am especially looking forward to meeting the mammoths and sabre-toothed cats in the coming weeks .
andrew watt , scotland i was expecting technical improvements over walking with dinosaurs , especially in the area of the dynamics .
unfortunately many of the large beasties move as if they have zero mass , the small ones as if they have too much inertia , and gravity appears to act in sharp tugs instead of a constant force .
next time , get a physicist to check your work .
chris butterworth , uk i enjoyed the programme .
it 's interesting to learn about creatures from this interim period , which are so different to what came before and after them .
but a little more background and context would have improved the format .
alastair stevens , cambridge , uk it may well be make believe but it looked very real to me .
i had to look away at some of the scenes of predators eating their prey .
excellent graphics , highly entertaining and a welcome change from game shows and soaps !
for once , i did n't have to resort to finding something interesting on the sky channels .
jacky , uk i only miss attenborough 's commentary .
it gives the viewer a glimpse into an era never seen like this before .
programmes like this make it worth paying your tv licence !
ton zwartjens , uk i think that provided you bear in mind there is a lot of supposition going on , as is always the case with pre-historical subjects , then walking with beasts is an excellent programme .
when science is made both entertaining and educational , someone somewhere has done a marvellous job and deserves the viewers ' congratulations .
bill , uk only the first episode , so not willing to utterly condemn it yet -lrb- i thought the first episode of dinosaurs was a bit weak too . -rrb-
major problem is that it is harder to imitate fur and feathers than it is lizard skin - see jurassic park and final fantasy for hollywood 's attempt at them .
the images also suffer from being too " clean " - that is , you can tell they are computer generated because they just standout slightly from the backdrops - the twitching hoppy thing was bouncing through leaf litter without disturbing a single thing !
the " story " method of telling each episode is good - but is far too doom-laden .
everytime something was described it was " but ... danger lurks , no ordinary night , deadly surprise etc etc ... "
and the biggest bugbear of all - but i already know your arguments over this - it is all pure supposition - you can not predict behaviour !
but i 'd give it 6 out of 10 and cross my fingers the next episode is better -lrb- i think it will be - far more interested in big animals than little hoppy fluffy things -rrb- .
graham tubbs , uk a very enjoyable programme .
it both showed how far computer graphics has come and how far it has yet to go .
my main worry is accuracy as the wildlife documentary style means it was all portrayed as fact whereas i suspect that much of it was conjecture .
rob hayward , england great animation , but i 've never heard of any of the beasts in the first episode !
iain , uk like walking with dinosaurs , walking with beasts is a triumph ; however , the same flaws exist .
while kenneth brannagh is an excellent actor , his narration does not suit - he attempts to add too much drama through his voice , when music and the images alone could achieve this far better .
secondly , the ' script ' continues to speak of things as if they are facts when they are in fact merely conjecture .
admittedly this may be required to make the series more watchable , but it is highly misleading .
a slight rephrasing would make the script far less inaccurate .
these issues aside , the series is a joy to watch .
matthew dale , uk the interactive tv features enhanced the programme enormously , if this is what tv will be like in the future , roll on the future !
alistair smith , uk excellent , even better than before .
caroline , uk the programme was not nearly as good as the dinosaurs both technically and in content .
i thought that the little horse things were poorly animated and the whale thing standing on the lake bed was very similar in the day and at night .
it would have been good to see the monkey things surviving the co2 attack because they were up in the trees and co2 is too heavy to get up to them .
erik bean , uk i thoroughly enjoyed the first programme .
unfortunately there was so much other information available via the remote control that i was in danger of missing the programme itself .
what would be useful would be to keep the active feature available through the following programme so that i can watch the episode and then take time to access the wealth of additional information .
well done , bbc .
andrea , uk excellent stuff !
it had me convinced it was real - it will be added to my list of weekly viewing , definitely elaine , ireland fantastic !
j , scotland fascinating and a good visual treat .
just as good as its predecessor .
hope the rest of the series continues in the same way ben norwood , uk send us your comments : name : your e-mail address : country : comments : disclaimer : the bbc will put up as many of your comments as possible but we can not guarantee that all e-mails will be published .

the series looks at the creatures who roamed the earth after the dinosaurs had been blitzed by a comet or asteroid , and like its predecessor , it is full of digital special effects .
" like its dinosaur forerunner , this programme has been lavished with technology to make it stand alone .
but the sore fact remains that it is all make-believe and rather like a virtual wildlife programme without the real blood , sweat and smells , " says the bbc 's michael osborn .
but what do you think ?
is it as good as dinosaurs ?
or do you think it is a case of style over substance ?
with the evidence collected and the fact that these animals no longer exist , i personally found walking with beasts very good and the animation was quite impressive considering the amount of facts the crew had .
it 's a shame that some people here seem to want the moon on a stick .
karen picton , england brilliantly done and it looks so real .
i would like it to be an hour long , as you just get into it and it finishes .
more !
summy , scotland superb !
highly realistic ; my young son is convinced they 're all for real !
thought there was rather too much hype though .
beasts makes a very welcome change from the usual bbc schedule .
barry , uk sesame street directed by quentin tarantino mike , uk i found it a great delight , i have a large screen and surround sound and it was like sitting in the jungle !
ca n't wait for the next instalment .
keep up the good work .
roger deacon , england i watched the programme in full and at first did not think much of the original narrator though the animation was splendid .
later realising that you can watch the programme 24/7 on ibbc digital , i viewed the programme once again but this time with the alternative in-depth narrator .
i personally found this to be of a very high standard and rich with information .
much better !
the interaction enabled you to access evidence and facts whilst viewing , which was astonishing and shows once again the bbc leading the way forward in technology .
can not wait for more programmes in ibbc and the long awaited bbc news 24 interactive .
alister , uk impressive as ever !
hazel , uk bbc , you have outdone yourself again , first walking with dinosaurs , then blue planet , now this masterpiece .
truly outstanding work .
i loved walking with beasts although i was very disappointed that digital viewers got a lot more action - do they pay more for their licence than me ?
keep up the good work - well done .
rolando johnston , wales i like walking with beasts more than walking with dinosaurs because the beasts are like the next form of dinosaurs .
also , the dinosaurs only had dinosaurs in it , while the beasts have monkeys , giant ants and people .
jack d-j , england i loved it .
more please .
jalil ahmed , uk very good start , it is not as good as the blue planet though .
however , i will not miss a episode if i can as it is very interesting and put together brillantly .
robin e. west , uk i enjoyed the programme very much and found the animation quite incredible .
however , the producers must be cautious in their approach to using half-facts .
dinosaurs was great but essentially fictional with a breath of reality whereas blue planet was quite simply the best documentary i have ever seen .
i am expecting this show to mirror dinosaurs which is a shame because without kenneth brannagh , " head shots " and half-truths it could be fantastic !
nick , uk quite simply fantastic !
this is where digital television finally lives up to all the promises !
as for some people gripping on about the simplistic narration , well , on digital tv you had a choice and tons more interesting science and information , so go out and get yourself a digibox , sky and itv digital are still giving them away free !
gary fowler , uk the beeb has just shown us how the future and present of interactive tv can be done , regardless of the " factual " elements .
this show should make sky sit up and take notice !
tim simmons , uk well done , the beeb !
loved the drama of it all .
the funniest moment was when one of those primates rubbed noses with one of the other primates , complete with a very human kissing sound .
had to rewind the video to make sure i 'd heard right .
zig , uk excellent programming , as dinosaurs before .
it seems a little rushed this time and has great inconsistencies of style .
some animation is fantastic while other movement appears jerky and unreal .
overall image sometimes gives the impression of very small -lrb- toy-like -rrb- animals while other shots are almost cinematic in their quality .
i agree with the digtv comments , true interactive viewing .
woods , uk i watched walking with beasts last night and thought it was excellent for both adults and kids !
obviously it does n't hold the same fascination that the public still has with dinosaurs , but it was truly amazing to watch creatures , such as the one the whale descended from that you would otherwise have no ideaabout .
money well spent , and technology very well used .
joni , uk overall i thought it was great , although the shaky narration did let it down .
i would have loved to have seen the extras on digital , but for all my repeated pressing of the blue button nothing happened .
seems i missed out there .
this programme is obviously more fun than fact , but as long as you accept it as such there should n't be any problem with that .
anthony , uk superb effects , it equals walking with dinosaurs .
debbie boote , uk excellent programme , but why are the interactive features only available to sky viewers ?
i have cable from telewest and pressing the red button did nothing .
like blue planet , and walking with dinosaurs , the programme was great , and you really get the benefit of digital wide screen tvs .
antony , uk this programme was great entertainment and i did actually learn a little about the type of creatures that inhabited the post-dinosaur era .
however i feel that the bbc should back this series up with a factual indepth science programme , to satify those who want to know more .
greg , uk tales from the riverbank for the now generation .
dumb , pseudoscience for the gullible or for animation freaks .
at least the music 's better than wild africa .
karen , uk the programme was entertaining , but for me that is its downfall .
in contrast , dinosaurs was fascinating - that 's an enormous qualitative difference .
i appreciate that animating fur and feathers is a greater challenge than animating reptilian-skin , but the fur animation was n't what let this programme down - it was poorly observed movement which glared out most significantly for me .
surely it would have been no great task to use footage of an equivalent-sized real animal as the basis for the animations , and simply change the detail and features ?
r a coldbreath , uk the truth is that any programme - such as walking with beasts - that brings prehistory to life is going to be full of speculation .
accept this and the programme is as beautiful as it is entertaining .
any soul who seriously believes every single thing they see on tv needs their head examined .
phil yorke , england narration was very poor and was over dramatic .
visual effects were poor compared with what can be done today .
movement of beasts was very unrealistic and did not flow right .
all my friends were looking forward to this and all were very disappointed .
aran porter , uk i was very underwhelmed .
sadly , not the same impact as walking with dinosaurs .
shaun stoker , scotland amazing programme , feel very left out not having digital tv .
i still pay the same licence though and it seems a little unfair .
chris kimberley , england absolutely great !
for accuracy 's sake , i think it 's very difficult to be 100 % correct since these animals lived millions of years ago and of course it is only natural that some guess-work is involved .
i love bbc programmes such as these .
please keep up the good work .
i only wish it was programmed earlier since we are one hour ahead of uk .
lucette joseph , belgium i thought last night 's first episode of walking with beasts was fantastic , superbly portraying a sizeable chunk of our natural history which to most is unknown and neglected .
however , i do feel that a lot of viewers will be more engaged by the mightier beasts which will appear later on , just as with the walking with dinosaurs series .
for a vast majority of the programme you could n't help but think , " i did n't think there were any of those creatures still alive to film ! " , the scenes , camera-work and creatures were so incredibly realistic .
i ca n't wait for the models to go on my desk at work .
brilliant .
daniel fowler , england one word - impressive !
alexander alexeev , uk -lrb- russian -rrb- science fiction - in fact 10 % science fact , 90 % science fiction .
take the supposed ancestor of the whale for example - the ambulocetus .
here are the problems with that assumption from the fossilised bones that were actually found - a -rrb- the skeleton is incomplete , with critical parts supporting the ' whale ' claims missing - pelvis , forelimbs , hemerus and scapula plus other features are missing. b -rrb- the robust femur and prescence of a hoof suggest ambulacetus was a land-dwelling creature. c -rrb- the ambulacetus was found in ' lower to middle eocene beds .
fossils of whales of the suborder archeoceti have been found in lower eocene strata , so ambulacetus is unlikely to be an ancestor of modern whales .
jon miles , uk re the comments about " facts " .
if anyone commenting has actually been to the times that this programme covers then they can harp on about " facts " .
otherwise , shut up and do n't watch .
a vast majority of " facts " about this era are based on supposition and deduction , and just because they are not " facts " you like , does not make them invalid .
simon , uk great animation , very realistic .
however i find the style of the programme to be over dramatic and it tends to personify the animals .
the narrator makes many statements about the behaviour etc of the animals but at no point in the programme does he say that some of the infomation is mere speculation .
the programme would be more successful as a factual documentary rather than a narrated childish " story " .
john simper , uk simply the best .
ron duncan , uk i ca n't believe the derogatory comments about the style and and content of this fantastic programme .
if only the other 23 hours a day of tv could be as good .
mark , england i thought this was very good as far as it went .
as others have said , the animation of fur and feathers is not as easy as lizard skin , this became apparent very early on .
i agreed with erik bean , i am sure that was the same sequence day and night with different colouration .
i do n't agree with alistair currah , i believe the environment shown would have been a noisy place .
the problem with this as it did not go far enough for anyone wanting to understand the known facts and how what was represented was achieved .
i do n't know what was on the digital extras as i do n't have digital , but a few extra pop-ups as the programme goes on are not what i would be looking for .
i will be watching next week .
will , uk beasts took me to a magical world , it was inspiring and interesting .
of course its accuracy is only down to the guestimates of scientists !
daniel philpott , england i 've seen more convincing glove puppets !
jonathan jones , england fantastic !
wonderfully produced , and incredibly beautiful .
i only wish the rest of tv was this good .
ashley penney , uk i thought the effects were disappointing .
previous comments highlighting the animals ' apparent ' zero mass ' are absolutely right - this is a perennial and unresolved problem with animation , and whilst the creatures in the programme have evolved in comparison with dinosaurs , i think the bbc 's animation has regressed .
james , england absolutely brilliant .
wish i had watched walking with dinosaurs now .
ken mclachlan , scotland good animation but again , creative speculation distributed as fact .
jurassic park did it better and was more accurate james murphy , uk ten out of ten .
just wish they would put it on earlier .
my kids wanted to stay up to watch it and we let them , now they 're like half cut knives this morning .
ruaridh shuttleworth , scotland wow !
love the effects lauren , uk i watched part of it and turned over , some of the assumptions were astounding - ' we know its true because we 've just made it up ' .
please let this be the last .
dene , england sesame street directed by quentin tarantino .
mike , uk great - only one gripe , which is being hammered by adverts for the bbc 's digital service .
i live in an area which can not receive digital tv and , as such , i do not wish to know what fantastic things i could have access to -lrb- more information , different narration , further interesting content -rrb- , if only i could get digital tv .
sarah , reading , uk fantastic !
what a magical journey back in time .
what irony that such exciting beasts have evolved into such slothful couch potatoes .
mother nature must be aghast !
dr. simon hill , uk i thought it was excellent - there had to be a certain amount of artistic licence as we will never really know exactly what the animals were like .
the research and animation were fantastic and most certainly on a par with walking with dinosaurs .
amanda , uk although the original narration was found to be a little patronising by some , the in-depth version available via bbci on digital tv made the programme much more enjoyable .
as the first interactive bbc broadcast i was very impressed and look forward to the next episode .
being able to switch between streams was useful and not at all distracting since it was repeated several times and you could take different routes throughout the programme .
chris phillips , essex , uk i was most impressed by the digital programme available through digital tv straight after the show .
extras were most interesting and informative and i found the more detailed commentary most impressive .
andy fowler , uk beasts is a snapshot of opinion in time which is highly entertaining and informative - i hope the bbc are really proud of this dave , uk great effects !
but seriously if you look beneath them we have a seriously dumbed down programme .
where has the science gone ?
come on bbc , please give people more qualified facts and not speculation !
graham p , uk i watched this on sky digital and what a difference , the standard commentary could be swapped for a much more interesting in depth version and the evidence and making of options superb .
i kept on watching to try and catch it all and almost missed question time .
digital tv comes of age and i ca n't wait until next week .
steve , uk i thought the programme was fun and slightly educational .
i thought the models and graphics good , although the horse things did n't really look like they were eating the grapes .
i thought the narration was good enough and the screen facts on itv digital filled in the gaps and provided some interesting facts , but why ca n't itv digital viewers have the scientific commentary as well ?
a lot of people below have commented on the speculations made in the programme .
well to be honest , this is n't the sort of programme that i 'd expect to be 100 % facutally correct .
it 's not really a documentary and should n't be watched as such , it 's " faction " .
i see it as a sort of beginners guide to paelentology , and if you liked what you watched and want to know more then go and read a book .
also the screen facts did hint at what was speculation and what was fact , eg the horses eating the grapes was based on the preserved stomach contents of one fossil .
not sure about their drunken antics though !
overall a good effort by the bbc and i 'd much rather have these semi-documentaries than those annoying docu-soaps any day .
jonathan , uk very impressive .
as for basis in fact , so what ? !
i feel only the scientific community cares that much about what colour they were .
beasts is a snapshot of opinion in time which is highly entertaining and informative .
i hope the bbc are really proud of this .
dave , uk unrealistic , simplistic , not a patch on walking with dinosaurs - a veneer of style with little content to stiffen it .
nn , england i got so fed up with advert after advert for this .
between programmes in other programmes , i turned over and watched top gear , but not before the announcer mentioning it was starting on the other side .
there must a point where this saturation of advertisments becomes detrimental ?
rick burt , uk of course it 's a " virtual wildlife programme " , these creatures do n't exist anymore !
this is as good as we can currently get to showcasing what nature might have been like during this long lost period .
damian elsen , uk eye candy definitely , but ken brannagh sounds like he is reading his shopping list .
he just ca n't hold the attention like david attenborough .
paul wilkinson , england tacky and irritating in that a fascinating subject matter has been turned into a disneyesque farce .
and that narration !
i 'll probably watch the next episode , but only to see if there 's any improvement .
if not , i wo n't bother with it .
let 's have more real science , bbc , and less fairytale stuff .
graeme , uk let 's face it , this is no more than the muppet show for the computer age abe , scotland excellent in some ways but there was criticism of walking with dinosaurs and the producers of this sequel listened to none of them .
the overdramatic narration is laughable , the prediction of behaviour -lrb- by simply mapping that of modern day animals occupying the same ecological niche -rrb- is grating , and the animation is patchy -lrb- small animals good , big animals bad -rrb- .
however , this is about the first documentary to cover this period of evolution that i am aware of - much needed .
steve johnson , uk luckily i have digital satellite so was able to enjoy the more detailed narration , but i did occasionally switch to the regular voiceover to hear the difference .
a few years ago we might have expected the detailed commentary to be the kind of narration we would hear on a bbc documentary .
now with world-wide sales more of an issue than the home market and the continued dumbing down in bbc1 documentaries eg the lightweight and sensationalist missed opportunity that was space .
walking with beasts was a good show , but needlessly stripped of educational value by a narrative structure more based on anthropomorphism and emotive sentiment .
can we have our intelligent bbc back please , for those without digital satellite ?
harry neary , uk regarding the graphics , the mixture of real settings and animal footage , computer generated imagery and animatronics is a bold one - and it does n't entirely work .
the faux wildlife documentary works , but is mixed with over dramatic shots that ruin the illusion .
the animation , as with dinosaurs , seems a little unrealistic , the creatures appearing slightly sluggish and weightless .
all in all though , the graphics are very high standard for tv .
mtm , england let 's face it , this is no more than the muppet show for the computer age , and to that end it is enjoyable .
however , the presentation of guess work and fiction as historical fact is dishonest .
abe , scotland like walking with dinosaurs , this involves so much speculation as to make it almost fictional .
the effects were n't even as good as the predecessor , i 'm afraid .
not impressed .
trevor blayney , n.ireland beasts is bound to generate the same criticisms as its forebear , but this is to miss the point of this type of documentary .
it has been repeatedly stated by the programme 's producers that this is not an exercise in scientific broadcasting - this is n't going to mislead anybody .
the comments above make it clear that people recognise that it is n't real .
if the style was more evidentially-based , we 'd just have a paleontology programme with good graphics - as the walking with dinosaurs specials showed , these are indeed often better programmes than the series itself , but the series are not designed with the same aims in mind .
walking with beasts , and dinosaurs , are fantasies , speculations about the way the world might have been , and that 's what they should be .
as for the programme itself , the animation on the mammals was generally good , the bird very poor and the close-ups of both looked too much like taxidermists ' specimens to be convincing as living animals .
more seriously , given that this is a series intended to show the development of mammals into modern forms , the selection of animals ranged from inadequate , such as the absence of bats -lrb- especially well-known from the messel site the programme purported to visit -rrb- and pangolins , to downright misleading , as with the brief shot of a pair of tamanduas , south american anteaters in the xentarthan mammal group , which has never existed in germany .
p bowles , uk well , initially expected more quality from the programme , but after viewing the documentary for the first 5 minutes , i could n't resist more .
last year i saw the same series with dinosaurs and other beasts , it is good to see the animation and the realistic screenplay .
satya sk j , uk another triumph of style over content by the bbc .
they give us a massively hyped series crammed full of computer-generated species in a primetime bbc1 slot , whilst relegating the spectacular wild africa series to bbc2 .
one contains beautifully-shot images from one of the most beautiful places on earth , whilst the other gives us sub-jurassic park rubbish , suitable perhaps for those still young enough to glean some entertainment from such baseless wanderings , but the more discerning viewer prefers to have something tangible to watch .
time after time , real-life footage will win out in my household over flashy , over-hyped special effects .
rich beadnall , uk rich beadnall - what do you expect the bbc to do ?
genetically recreate these dead species ?
have some imagination .
martin harvey , uk very enjoyable show and very impressive graphics .
however , the fact they were graphics was certainly more noticeable than with the previous walking with dinosaurs .
indeed , i also feel that you the programme is attempting to cover too much of the evolution timetable .
although , i stand to be corrected and i look forward to next week 's episode .
ian nockolds , england brilliant animation ruined by dumbed down janet and john commentary .
i know you can get more info on digital but i find the bbc 's attitude insulting .
steve windsor , england another winner - i thought it was excellent .
martyn key , uk beasts is another wonderful production .
however , like dinosaurs , the animals tend to be a bit " cutesy " and seem capable of pulling sad / happy / worried faces .
they also seem very noisy .
hunted animals , and indeed hunting animals , do not make the cacaphony these seemed to .
roaring only depletes the energy reserves needed to outrun your chaser , or catch your prey .
all in all though , a very entertaining programme .
alistair currah , uk great show , but the commentary left a little to be desired - far too much ' ah , look at the cute furry animals ' and not enough evidence of how they know about the creatures and their environment .
the interactive features are excellent though , especially the more in-depth soundtrack -lrb- which should have been on the proper showing in my opinion -rrb- - but why ca n't i watch the show with the scientific soundtrack in full screen ?
lee , uk i think it was just as good as walking with dinosaurs : the earlier series was high quality , lowbrow nonsense too .
it bothers me quite a bit that the programme was presented as scientific fact .
the popularity of programmes like this is symptomatic of a society that embraces woolly quasi-mystical mumbo-jumbo like feng shui , and reacts with horror to scientific advances like the human genome project .
i sometimes feel i 'm living through the middle ages again , surrounded by flat-earthers .
let 's hope the bbc presents some popular , intelligent and accurate science soon , or a generation raised on television will always confuse supposition with fact .
russell jones , manchester , uk very good programme - watched part of the " regular " commentary before switching to the " indeph " commentary on interactive .
the indepth commentary gave a lot more information and focused more on what is known through research rather than cute speculation .
good interactive features through out and after the programme .
vic , uk good as entertainment , but the programme and the web ite are dreadful as education .
just looking at gastornis , we get gems such as " ... must have been a silent ambush hunter " -lrb- web site -rrb- is there truly no other possible explanation , such as scavenger , or is this the most likely explanation ?
then we are told that the giant bill was used for a " ... more sinister purpose " -lrb- website -rrb- , implying that predation in the animal kingdom is somehow immoral .
the bbc needs to take much more care over the way supposition and speculation are presented if it is trying to present this work as science .
gary evans , uk the programme was very enjoyable , but as with walking with dinosaurs , the commentary seemed to suffer from a lot of hearsay rather than fact .
fortunately we have digital tv and were able to switch to the alternative commentary , which was much better .
the other interactive services also added a lot to the programme .
justin hughes , reading , uk really really good .
i thoroughly enjoyed it , only wish it was on longer !
lisa finnegan , uk the main concept of this episode was that birds ruled the world yet we only saw one species .
this one was flightless - were all the others able to fly and flew off when the cameramen appeared ?
simon heffer , uk as the programme is done in the same style and format as dinosaurs , i think it was -lrb- and will be -rrb- just as good - it 's a winning formula and a great idea as a follow-up .
stuart , uk commission more programmes that will question , challenge and stimulate , not present us with a half-baked cartoon with an ill conceived storyline t mathews , uk i watched walking with dinosaurs and loved every moment , so much that i bought it on dvd .
i 'm a fan of the beeb 's innovative way of approaching unusual nature documentaries , like the truly incredible alien empires -lrb- insects -rrb- and the blue planet .
i could n't be happier with the first episode of walking with beasts , one of the most interesting and least known periods of earth 's history .
brimming with information , ideas , and concepts ; presented with infectious enthusiasm , how can one not feel the spine tingle when the narrator intones - with a detectable impish glee - " this is a world in which birds eat horses " .
i already know i 'll be watching the subsequent episodes , safe in the knowledge they 'll be of the same quality .
the walking with ... series attempt the impossible : to give us humans today a sense of the sheer scale and variety of pre-history , it simultaneously grips and humbles the viewer .
genuine thanks to all production crew involved - you are leading and teaching the world !
awesome stuff .
maartin , nederlands -lrb- british -rrb- the digitally generated creatures were amazingly ' realistic ' , but , i 'm sorry to say , i just was n't particularly interested in the narrative .
phil steer , england walking with beasts was an entertaining ramble - however , will this mark the future of wildlife documentaries ?
what with the amount of endangered species in the world , will the bbc , say in fifty years time , be filming walking with pandas ?
jon , uk i loved the programme and found it entertaining and really believable .
even better than the dinosaurs .
jane newman , uk wow !
love the effects .
this looks to be a very good series .
lauren , uk i thought that it was absolutely rubbish !
the effects were pathetic , the close up models looked too plasticy and the sounds were a shambles .
the bbc is just trying to make as much money from an old idea as possible .
the movements in dinosaurs were not too bad , but in this they were completely pathetic - i had to switch over .
harry , uk i thought it was enthralling and fascinating but i found it very annoying that theories were presented as fact .
some of the " facts " stated with absolute confidence in the show are highly disputed .
george , slough , uk " all make-believe ... "
i would n't agree with that .
it sounds like it should be treated as a work of fiction .
the science behind it is rooted in fact and reason .
although it may not be 100 % correct , that is still not the same as it being a work of fiction and " all make-believe " .
maybe the underlying facts and reason are not put forward enough ?
i think the reason why scientists think the way they do is often missing in science programmes such as walking with beasts .
it is not just a case of looking at a fossil and then dreaming up a beast .
there is a process of examining multiple facts , each with multiple explanations , and finding the common explanation that ties them all together , sort of like the way a detective solves a crime or the way a sceptic thinks about ufos .
it is the facts and the thinking that makes this more than fiction .
andrew wallace , sweden i really enjoyed the first episode .
it was a shame though that only sky digital had the option of choosing which voiceover to have , as i would have liked to have heard the other factual commentary .
i hope the dvd contains both options when it is produced .
as to complaints about accuracy , what do people expect ?
these animals have been extinct for millenia and all praise to the teams involved for putting together such an interesting programme with such little information .
keep it up .
chris , uk the bbc has obviously spent huge amounts of our money on what will doubtless be a very popular series .
however , the " small dinosaur eaten by big dinosaur " storyline has been done to death now .
do us all a favour , dyke , and commission more programmes that will question , challenge and stimulate , not present us with a half-baked cartoon with an ill conceived storyline .
t mathews , uk more a case of hype over quality .
some of the scenes were very poor .
in one it looked as if frames had been removed as the little creature jumped .
andrew puto , uk very interesting , i 've often wondered how the post-dinosaur world started out .
i commend the bbc for bringing science to life , even if a lot of artistic licence has been used to achieve it .
martin holmes , uk finally a programme that justifies digital tv rb , uk i was disappointed with this production , it was a poor attempt at a documentary on the beasts as if they were actually alive and being filmed .
the animals were personified far too much .
the little family of kangaroo mice things were almost comical in the way they were reacting to each other and their surroundings , almost as if they were theme park characters dressed up to entertain children .
you would have thought that the animators of the animals had never even seen a wild animal before .
let alone studied their interactions .
it was almost as if the animals were having conversations with each other .
animals that do n't talk rely on body language to communicate mood and intent , none of which was evident in the animals featured in the show .
if the makers of the show were intending to make a cute fictitious story for children to enjoy , they probably did a good job .
as a nature documentary , it did n't convince me .
alex dale , uk i was disappointed .
the creatures ' behaviour and characteristics were not researched to the same level to those featured in dinosaurs .
because of that , wild guesses have been made , guesses which seem to be somewhat romantic rather than boring and serious .
if it 's worth doing , do it properly .
robbo , england finally a programme that justifies digital tv , and shows how it can be used to genuinely enhance a show , even if you could only get the full effect on sky .
after about 5 minutes we switched over to the much better in depth soundtrack and then at the end watched the re-run of the programme with the evidence , which really was a different programme in its own right .
is it as good as walking with dinosaurs ?
no - it is much better .
the lack of nauseating commentary -lrb- or at least being able to switch to an alternative -rrb- makes it worthy of being called a science programme rather than entertainment .
rb , uk fantastic effects and graphics , let down by a script unnecessarily dramatised and full of clichÃ©s .
i would liked to have seen a few more facts supporting their interpretation of this ancient world .
martin , uk i never subscribed to the swooning over dinosaurs myself .
if you ignored the admittedly wonderful pictures and concentrated on the commentary , it was cod-science of the worst sort .
i happened to turn on beasts last night , and the first thing i heard ?
" such and such is a mammal , and therefore spends a lot of time looking after her brood . "
the only person who could reliably attest to this is doctor who , and i did n't see his name in the end credits .
it seems to me that these sorts of programmes fall between two stools - science and entertainment - and end up being unsatisfactory on both counts .
the makers should either make a feature film with these animals as the stars -lrb- a la a bug 's life -rrb- or write a reliable and accurate commentary .
for instance , " such and such is a mammal , and therefore it is quite likely that she spends a lot of time looking after her brood . "
picky maybe , but then science is picky .
edward , uk will they oust harry potter ?
jerry hughes , england it was absolutely a case of style over substance .
that in itself is n't a problem , but the programme masquerades as " natural history " .
it is n't , it 's speculation .
if there was more of an admission of this , then i would respect the programme more .
until then , i 'll stick to the much more exciting blue planet - real animals are more fascinating .
andy cotgreave , uk well paced , excellently produced with clear but not obtrusive narration .
the first programme kept not only 10 and 12-year-old children of this household , but also adults enthralled - and that was before we reviewed everything again on digital !
the extra information on the digital channel , ranging from the making of , supporting evidence and modern day corollaries was truly superb .
the potential of this form of tv is massive both in education and entertainment terms and the bbc should be congratulated for excellent use of this media .
in comparison to walking with dinosaurs , this series looks to be a step up in terms of narration , information available -lrb- if you have digital -rrb- and graphics -lrb- the movements of the animals is so realistic , it is as if they have been filmed live in the wild - although the faces of the miniature horses did look a bit like cuddly toys ! -rrb-
undoubtedly the video and dvd versions of this will find their way onto christmas lists world wide - perhaps even furry models of these extinct animals will make it there too - but will they oust harry potter ?
well done the bbc !
jerry hughes , england the kids and i loved it , although i do find the factual presentation of what is supposition difficult to latch on to at times .
stuart e , uk very good , but the frequent prompts in the interactive version were annoying .
it was better watching it normally .
colin denholm , uk very enjoyable .
the graphics were unbelievable and sometimes you had to remind yourself they were computer graphics , not real animals .
but this does n't take away from the learning factor .
if anything it helps it in getting people interested and then intrigued in the animal life of so long ago .
excellent work , it would always be hard to live up to dinosaurs as they have always had the public interest but walking with beasts is a worthy follow up - well done .
gerard mclaughlin , n.ireland i loved dinosaurs and hoped that beasts could live up to the standards set by its predecessor .
if the first episode is anything to go by , me , and i suspect millions of others , wo n't be disappointed .
awe inspiring stuff once again .
i am especially looking forward to meeting the mammoths and sabre-toothed cats in the coming weeks .
andrew watt , scotland i was expecting technical improvements over walking with dinosaurs , especially in the area of the dynamics .
unfortunately many of the large beasties move as if they have zero mass , the small ones as if they have too much inertia , and gravity appears to act in sharp tugs instead of a constant force .
next time , get a physicist to check your work .
chris butterworth , uk i enjoyed the programme .
it 's interesting to learn about creatures from this interim period , which are so different to what came before and after them .
but a little more background and context would have improved the format .
alastair stevens , cambridge , uk it may well be make believe but it looked very real to me .
i had to look away at some of the scenes of predators eating their prey .
excellent graphics , highly entertaining and a welcome change from game shows and soaps !
for once , i did n't have to resort to finding something interesting on the sky channels .
jacky , uk i only miss attenborough 's commentary .
it gives the viewer a glimpse into an era never seen like this before .
programmes like this make it worth paying your tv licence !
ton zwartjens , uk i think that provided you bear in mind there is a lot of supposition going on , as is always the case with pre-historical subjects , then walking with beasts is an excellent programme .
when science is made both entertaining and educational , someone somewhere has done a marvellous job and deserves the viewers ' congratulations .
bill , uk only the first episode , so not willing to utterly condemn it yet -lrb- i thought the first episode of dinosaurs was a bit weak too . -rrb-
major problem is that it is harder to imitate fur and feathers than it is lizard skin - see jurassic park and final fantasy for hollywood 's attempt at them .
the images also suffer from being too " clean " - that is , you can tell they are computer generated because they just standout slightly from the backdrops - the twitching hoppy thing was bouncing through leaf litter without disturbing a single thing !
the " story " method of telling each episode is good - but is far too doom-laden .
everytime something was described it was " but ... danger lurks , no ordinary night , deadly surprise etc etc ... "
and the biggest bugbear of all - but i already know your arguments over this - it is all pure supposition - you can not predict behaviour !
but i 'd give it 6 out of 10 and cross my fingers the next episode is better -lrb- i think it will be - far more interested in big animals than little hoppy fluffy things -rrb- .
graham tubbs , uk a very enjoyable programme .
it both showed how far computer graphics has come and how far it has yet to go .
my main worry is accuracy as the wildlife documentary style means it was all portrayed as fact whereas i suspect that much of it was conjecture .
rob hayward , england great animation , but i 've never heard of any of the beasts in the first episode !
iain , uk like walking with dinosaurs , walking with beasts is a triumph ; however , the same flaws exist .
while kenneth brannagh is an excellent actor , his narration does not suit - he attempts to add too much drama through his voice , when music and the images alone could achieve this far better .
secondly , the ' script ' continues to speak of things as if they are facts when they are in fact merely conjecture .
admittedly this may be required to make the series more watchable , but it is highly misleading .
a slight rephrasing would make the script far less inaccurate .
these issues aside , the series is a joy to watch .
matthew dale , uk the interactive tv features enhanced the programme enormously , if this is what tv will be like in the future , roll on the future !
alistair smith , uk excellent , even better than before .
caroline , uk the programme was not nearly as good as the dinosaurs both technically and in content .
i thought that the little horse things were poorly animated and the whale thing standing on the lake bed was very similar in the day and at night .
it would have been good to see the monkey things surviving the co2 attack because they were up in the trees and co2 is too heavy to get up to them .
erik bean , uk i thoroughly enjoyed the first programme .
unfortunately there was so much other information available via the remote control that i was in danger of missing the programme itself .
what would be useful would be to keep the active feature available through the following programme so that i can watch the episode and then take time to access the wealth of additional information .
well done , bbc .
andrea , uk excellent stuff !
it had me convinced it was real - it will be added to my list of weekly viewing , definitely elaine , ireland fantastic !
j , scotland fascinating and a good visual treat .
just as good as its predecessor .
hope the rest of the series continues in the same way ben norwood , uk send us your comments : name : your e-mail address : country : comments : disclaimer : the bbc will put up as many of your comments as possible but we can not guarantee that all e-mails will be published .

the series looks at the creatures who roamed the earth after the dinosaurs had been blitzed by a comet or asteroid , and like its predecessor , it is full of digital special effects .
" like its dinosaur forerunner , this programme has been lavished with technology to make it stand alone .
but the sore fact remains that it is all make-believe and rather like a virtual wildlife programme without the real blood , sweat and smells , " says the bbc 's michael osborn .
but what do you think ?
is it as good as dinosaurs ?
or do you think it is a case of style over substance ?
with the evidence collected and the fact that these animals no longer exist , i personally found walking with beasts very good and the animation was quite impressive considering the amount of facts the crew had .
it 's a shame that some people here seem to want the moon on a stick .
karen picton , england brilliantly done and it looks so real .
i would like it to be an hour long , as you just get into it and it finishes .
more !
summy , scotland superb !
highly realistic ; my young son is convinced they 're all for real !
thought there was rather too much hype though .
beasts makes a very welcome change from the usual bbc schedule .
barry , uk sesame street directed by quentin tarantino mike , uk i found it a great delight , i have a large screen and surround sound and it was like sitting in the jungle !
ca n't wait for the next instalment .
keep up the good work .
roger deacon , england i watched the programme in full and at first did not think much of the original narrator though the animation was splendid .
later realising that you can watch the programme 24/7 on ibbc digital , i viewed the programme once again but this time with the alternative in-depth narrator .
i personally found this to be of a very high standard and rich with information .
much better !
the interaction enabled you to access evidence and facts whilst viewing , which was astonishing and shows once again the bbc leading the way forward in technology .
can not wait for more programmes in ibbc and the long awaited bbc news 24 interactive .
alister , uk impressive as ever !
hazel , uk bbc , you have outdone yourself again , first walking with dinosaurs , then blue planet , now this masterpiece .
truly outstanding work .
i loved walking with beasts although i was very disappointed that digital viewers got a lot more action - do they pay more for their licence than me ?
keep up the good work - well done .
rolando johnston , wales i like walking with beasts more than walking with dinosaurs because the beasts are like the next form of dinosaurs .
also , the dinosaurs only had dinosaurs in it , while the beasts have monkeys , giant ants and people .
jack d-j , england i loved it .
more please .
jalil ahmed , uk very good start , it is not as good as the blue planet though .
however , i will not miss a episode if i can as it is very interesting and put together brillantly .
robin e. west , uk i enjoyed the programme very much and found the animation quite incredible .
however , the producers must be cautious in their approach to using half-facts .
dinosaurs was great but essentially fictional with a breath of reality whereas blue planet was quite simply the best documentary i have ever seen .
i am expecting this show to mirror dinosaurs which is a shame because without kenneth brannagh , " head shots " and half-truths it could be fantastic !
nick , uk quite simply fantastic !
this is where digital television finally lives up to all the promises !
as for some people gripping on about the simplistic narration , well , on digital tv you had a choice and tons more interesting science and information , so go out and get yourself a digibox , sky and itv digital are still giving them away free !
gary fowler , uk the beeb has just shown us how the future and present of interactive tv can be done , regardless of the " factual " elements .
this show should make sky sit up and take notice !
tim simmons , uk well done , the beeb !
loved the drama of it all .
the funniest moment was when one of those primates rubbed noses with one of the other primates , complete with a very human kissing sound .
had to rewind the video to make sure i 'd heard right .
zig , uk excellent programming , as dinosaurs before .
it seems a little rushed this time and has great inconsistencies of style .
some animation is fantastic while other movement appears jerky and unreal .
overall image sometimes gives the impression of very small -lrb- toy-like -rrb- animals while other shots are almost cinematic in their quality .
i agree with the digtv comments , true interactive viewing .
woods , uk i watched walking with beasts last night and thought it was excellent for both adults and kids !
obviously it does n't hold the same fascination that the public still has with dinosaurs , but it was truly amazing to watch creatures , such as the one the whale descended from that you would otherwise have no ideaabout .
money well spent , and technology very well used .
joni , uk overall i thought it was great , although the shaky narration did let it down .
i would have loved to have seen the extras on digital , but for all my repeated pressing of the blue button nothing happened .
seems i missed out there .
this programme is obviously more fun than fact , but as long as you accept it as such there should n't be any problem with that .
anthony , uk superb effects , it equals walking with dinosaurs .
debbie boote , uk excellent programme , but why are the interactive features only available to sky viewers ?
i have cable from telewest and pressing the red button did nothing .
like blue planet , and walking with dinosaurs , the programme was great , and you really get the benefit of digital wide screen tvs .
antony , uk this programme was great entertainment and i did actually learn a little about the type of creatures that inhabited the post-dinosaur era .
however i feel that the bbc should back this series up with a factual indepth science programme , to satify those who want to know more .
greg , uk tales from the riverbank for the now generation .
dumb , pseudoscience for the gullible or for animation freaks .
at least the music 's better than wild africa .
karen , uk the programme was entertaining , but for me that is its downfall .
in contrast , dinosaurs was fascinating - that 's an enormous qualitative difference .
i appreciate that animating fur and feathers is a greater challenge than animating reptilian-skin , but the fur animation was n't what let this programme down - it was poorly observed movement which glared out most significantly for me .
surely it would have been no great task to use footage of an equivalent-sized real animal as the basis for the animations , and simply change the detail and features ?
r a coldbreath , uk the truth is that any programme - such as walking with beasts - that brings prehistory to life is going to be full of speculation .
accept this and the programme is as beautiful as it is entertaining .
any soul who seriously believes every single thing they see on tv needs their head examined .
phil yorke , england narration was very poor and was over dramatic .
visual effects were poor compared with what can be done today .
movement of beasts was very unrealistic and did not flow right .
all my friends were looking forward to this and all were very disappointed .
aran porter , uk i was very underwhelmed .
sadly , not the same impact as walking with dinosaurs .
shaun stoker , scotland amazing programme , feel very left out not having digital tv .
i still pay the same licence though and it seems a little unfair .
chris kimberley , england absolutely great !
for accuracy 's sake , i think it 's very difficult to be 100 % correct since these animals lived millions of years ago and of course it is only natural that some guess-work is involved .
i love bbc programmes such as these .
please keep up the good work .
i only wish it was programmed earlier since we are one hour ahead of uk .
lucette joseph , belgium i thought last night 's first episode of walking with beasts was fantastic , superbly portraying a sizeable chunk of our natural history which to most is unknown and neglected .
however , i do feel that a lot of viewers will be more engaged by the mightier beasts which will appear later on , just as with the walking with dinosaurs series .
for a vast majority of the programme you could n't help but think , " i did n't think there were any of those creatures still alive to film ! " , the scenes , camera-work and creatures were so incredibly realistic .
i ca n't wait for the models to go on my desk at work .
brilliant .
daniel fowler , england one word - impressive !
alexander alexeev , uk -lrb- russian -rrb- science fiction - in fact 10 % science fact , 90 % science fiction .
take the supposed ancestor of the whale for example - the ambulocetus .
here are the problems with that assumption from the fossilised bones that were actually found - a -rrb- the skeleton is incomplete , with critical parts supporting the ' whale ' claims missing - pelvis , forelimbs , hemerus and scapula plus other features are missing. b -rrb- the robust femur and prescence of a hoof suggest ambulacetus was a land-dwelling creature. c -rrb- the ambulacetus was found in ' lower to middle eocene beds .
fossils of whales of the suborder archeoceti have been found in lower eocene strata , so ambulacetus is unlikely to be an ancestor of modern whales .
jon miles , uk re the comments about " facts " .
if anyone commenting has actually been to the times that this programme covers then they can harp on about " facts " .
otherwise , shut up and do n't watch .
a vast majority of " facts " about this era are based on supposition and deduction , and just because they are not " facts " you like , does not make them invalid .
simon , uk great animation , very realistic .
however i find the style of the programme to be over dramatic and it tends to personify the animals .
the narrator makes many statements about the behaviour etc of the animals but at no point in the programme does he say that some of the infomation is mere speculation .
the programme would be more successful as a factual documentary rather than a narrated childish " story " .
john simper , uk simply the best .
ron duncan , uk i ca n't believe the derogatory comments about the style and and content of this fantastic programme .
if only the other 23 hours a day of tv could be as good .
mark , england i thought this was very good as far as it went .
as others have said , the animation of fur and feathers is not as easy as lizard skin , this became apparent very early on .
i agreed with erik bean , i am sure that was the same sequence day and night with different colouration .
i do n't agree with alistair currah , i believe the environment shown would have been a noisy place .
the problem with this as it did not go far enough for anyone wanting to understand the known facts and how what was represented was achieved .
i do n't know what was on the digital extras as i do n't have digital , but a few extra pop-ups as the programme goes on are not what i would be looking for .
i will be watching next week .
will , uk beasts took me to a magical world , it was inspiring and interesting .
of course its accuracy is only down to the guestimates of scientists !
daniel philpott , england i 've seen more convincing glove puppets !
jonathan jones , england fantastic !
wonderfully produced , and incredibly beautiful .
i only wish the rest of tv was this good .
ashley penney , uk i thought the effects were disappointing .
previous comments highlighting the animals ' apparent ' zero mass ' are absolutely right - this is a perennial and unresolved problem with animation , and whilst the creatures in the programme have evolved in comparison with dinosaurs , i think the bbc 's animation has regressed .
james , england absolutely brilliant .
wish i had watched walking with dinosaurs now .
ken mclachlan , scotland good animation but again , creative speculation distributed as fact .
jurassic park did it better and was more accurate james murphy , uk ten out of ten .
just wish they would put it on earlier .
my kids wanted to stay up to watch it and we let them , now they 're like half cut knives this morning .
ruaridh shuttleworth , scotland wow !
love the effects lauren , uk i watched part of it and turned over , some of the assumptions were astounding - ' we know its true because we 've just made it up ' .
please let this be the last .
dene , england sesame street directed by quentin tarantino .
mike , uk great - only one gripe , which is being hammered by adverts for the bbc 's digital service .
i live in an area which can not receive digital tv and , as such , i do not wish to know what fantastic things i could have access to -lrb- more information , different narration , further interesting content -rrb- , if only i could get digital tv .
sarah , reading , uk fantastic !
what a magical journey back in time .
what irony that such exciting beasts have evolved into such slothful couch potatoes .
mother nature must be aghast !
dr. simon hill , uk i thought it was excellent - there had to be a certain amount of artistic licence as we will never really know exactly what the animals were like .
the research and animation were fantastic and most certainly on a par with walking with dinosaurs .
amanda , uk although the original narration was found to be a little patronising by some , the in-depth version available via bbci on digital tv made the programme much more enjoyable .
as the first interactive bbc broadcast i was very impressed and look forward to the next episode .
being able to switch between streams was useful and not at all distracting since it was repeated several times and you could take different routes throughout the programme .
chris phillips , essex , uk i was most impressed by the digital programme available through digital tv straight after the show .
extras were most interesting and informative and i found the more detailed commentary most impressive .
andy fowler , uk beasts is a snapshot of opinion in time which is highly entertaining and informative - i hope the bbc are really proud of this dave , uk great effects !
but seriously if you look beneath them we have a seriously dumbed down programme .
where has the science gone ?
come on bbc , please give people more qualified facts and not speculation !
graham p , uk i watched this on sky digital and what a difference , the standard commentary could be swapped for a much more interesting in depth version and the evidence and making of options superb .
i kept on watching to try and catch it all and almost missed question time .
digital tv comes of age and i ca n't wait until next week .
steve , uk i thought the programme was fun and slightly educational .
i thought the models and graphics good , although the horse things did n't really look like they were eating the grapes .
i thought the narration was good enough and the screen facts on itv digital filled in the gaps and provided some interesting facts , but why ca n't itv digital viewers have the scientific commentary as well ?
a lot of people below have commented on the speculations made in the programme .
well to be honest , this is n't the sort of programme that i 'd expect to be 100 % facutally correct .
it 's not really a documentary and should n't be watched as such , it 's " faction " .
i see it as a sort of beginners guide to paelentology , and if you liked what you watched and want to know more then go and read a book .
also the screen facts did hint at what was speculation and what was fact , eg the horses eating the grapes was based on the preserved stomach contents of one fossil .
not sure about their drunken antics though !
overall a good effort by the bbc and i 'd much rather have these semi-documentaries than those annoying docu-soaps any day .
jonathan , uk very impressive .
as for basis in fact , so what ? !
i feel only the scientific community cares that much about what colour they were .
beasts is a snapshot of opinion in time which is highly entertaining and informative .
i hope the bbc are really proud of this .
dave , uk unrealistic , simplistic , not a patch on walking with dinosaurs - a veneer of style with little content to stiffen it .
nn , england i got so fed up with advert after advert for this .
between programmes in other programmes , i turned over and watched top gear , but not before the announcer mentioning it was starting on the other side .
there must a point where this saturation of advertisments becomes detrimental ?
rick burt , uk of course it 's a " virtual wildlife programme " , these creatures do n't exist anymore !
this is as good as we can currently get to showcasing what nature might have been like during this long lost period .
damian elsen , uk eye candy definitely , but ken brannagh sounds like he is reading his shopping list .
he just ca n't hold the attention like david attenborough .
paul wilkinson , england tacky and irritating in that a fascinating subject matter has been turned into a disneyesque farce .
and that narration !
i 'll probably watch the next episode , but only to see if there 's any improvement .
if not , i wo n't bother with it .
let 's have more real science , bbc , and less fairytale stuff .
graeme , uk let 's face it , this is no more than the muppet show for the computer age abe , scotland excellent in some ways but there was criticism of walking with dinosaurs and the producers of this sequel listened to none of them .
the overdramatic narration is laughable , the prediction of behaviour -lrb- by simply mapping that of modern day animals occupying the same ecological niche -rrb- is grating , and the animation is patchy -lrb- small animals good , big animals bad -rrb- .
however , this is about the first documentary to cover this period of evolution that i am aware of - much needed .
steve johnson , uk luckily i have digital satellite so was able to enjoy the more detailed narration , but i did occasionally switch to the regular voiceover to hear the difference .
a few years ago we might have expected the detailed commentary to be the kind of narration we would hear on a bbc documentary .
now with world-wide sales more of an issue than the home market and the continued dumbing down in bbc1 documentaries eg the lightweight and sensationalist missed opportunity that was space .
walking with beasts was a good show , but needlessly stripped of educational value by a narrative structure more based on anthropomorphism and emotive sentiment .
can we have our intelligent bbc back please , for those without digital satellite ?
harry neary , uk regarding the graphics , the mixture of real settings and animal footage , computer generated imagery and animatronics is a bold one - and it does n't entirely work .
the faux wildlife documentary works , but is mixed with over dramatic shots that ruin the illusion .
the animation , as with dinosaurs , seems a little unrealistic , the creatures appearing slightly sluggish and weightless .
all in all though , the graphics are very high standard for tv .
mtm , england let 's face it , this is no more than the muppet show for the computer age , and to that end it is enjoyable .
however , the presentation of guess work and fiction as historical fact is dishonest .
abe , scotland like walking with dinosaurs , this involves so much speculation as to make it almost fictional .
the effects were n't even as good as the predecessor , i 'm afraid .
not impressed .
trevor blayney , n.ireland beasts is bound to generate the same criticisms as its forebear , but this is to miss the point of this type of documentary .
it has been repeatedly stated by the programme 's producers that this is not an exercise in scientific broadcasting - this is n't going to mislead anybody .
the comments above make it clear that people recognise that it is n't real .
if the style was more evidentially-based , we 'd just have a paleontology programme with good graphics - as the walking with dinosaurs specials showed , these are indeed often better programmes than the series itself , but the series are not designed with the same aims in mind .
walking with beasts , and dinosaurs , are fantasies , speculations about the way the world might have been , and that 's what they should be .
as for the programme itself , the animation on the mammals was generally good , the bird very poor and the close-ups of both looked too much like taxidermists ' specimens to be convincing as living animals .
more seriously , given that this is a series intended to show the development of mammals into modern forms , the selection of animals ranged from inadequate , such as the absence of bats -lrb- especially well-known from the messel site the programme purported to visit -rrb- and pangolins , to downright misleading , as with the brief shot of a pair of tamanduas , south american anteaters in the xentarthan mammal group , which has never existed in germany .
p bowles , uk well , initially expected more quality from the programme , but after viewing the documentary for the first 5 minutes , i could n't resist more .
last year i saw the same series with dinosaurs and other beasts , it is good to see the animation and the realistic screenplay .
satya sk j , uk another triumph of style over content by the bbc .
they give us a massively hyped series crammed full of computer-generated species in a primetime bbc1 slot , whilst relegating the spectacular wild africa series to bbc2 .
one contains beautifully-shot images from one of the most beautiful places on earth , whilst the other gives us sub-jurassic park rubbish , suitable perhaps for those still young enough to glean some entertainment from such baseless wanderings , but the more discerning viewer prefers to have something tangible to watch .
time after time , real-life footage will win out in my household over flashy , over-hyped special effects .
rich beadnall , uk rich beadnall - what do you expect the bbc to do ?
genetically recreate these dead species ?
have some imagination .
martin harvey , uk very enjoyable show and very impressive graphics .
however , the fact they were graphics was certainly more noticeable than with the previous walking with dinosaurs .
indeed , i also feel that you the programme is attempting to cover too much of the evolution timetable .
although , i stand to be corrected and i look forward to next week 's episode .
ian nockolds , england brilliant animation ruined by dumbed down janet and john commentary .
i know you can get more info on digital but i find the bbc 's attitude insulting .
steve windsor , england another winner - i thought it was excellent .
martyn key , uk beasts is another wonderful production .
however , like dinosaurs , the animals tend to be a bit " cutesy " and seem capable of pulling sad / happy / worried faces .
they also seem very noisy .
hunted animals , and indeed hunting animals , do not make the cacaphony these seemed to .
roaring only depletes the energy reserves needed to outrun your chaser , or catch your prey .
all in all though , a very entertaining programme .
alistair currah , uk great show , but the commentary left a little to be desired - far too much ' ah , look at the cute furry animals ' and not enough evidence of how they know about the creatures and their environment .
the interactive features are excellent though , especially the more in-depth soundtrack -lrb- which should have been on the proper showing in my opinion -rrb- - but why ca n't i watch the show with the scientific soundtrack in full screen ?
lee , uk i think it was just as good as walking with dinosaurs : the earlier series was high quality , lowbrow nonsense too .
it bothers me quite a bit that the programme was presented as scientific fact .
the popularity of programmes like this is symptomatic of a society that embraces woolly quasi-mystical mumbo-jumbo like feng shui , and reacts with horror to scientific advances like the human genome project .
i sometimes feel i 'm living through the middle ages again , surrounded by flat-earthers .
let 's hope the bbc presents some popular , intelligent and accurate science soon , or a generation raised on television will always confuse supposition with fact .
russell jones , manchester , uk very good programme - watched part of the " regular " commentary before switching to the " indeph " commentary on interactive .
the indepth commentary gave a lot more information and focused more on what is known through research rather than cute speculation .
good interactive features through out and after the programme .
vic , uk good as entertainment , but the programme and the web ite are dreadful as education .
just looking at gastornis , we get gems such as " ... must have been a silent ambush hunter " -lrb- web site -rrb- is there truly no other possible explanation , such as scavenger , or is this the most likely explanation ?
then we are told that the giant bill was used for a " ... more sinister purpose " -lrb- website -rrb- , implying that predation in the animal kingdom is somehow immoral .
the bbc needs to take much more care over the way supposition and speculation are presented if it is trying to present this work as science .
gary evans , uk the programme was very enjoyable , but as with walking with dinosaurs , the commentary seemed to suffer from a lot of hearsay rather than fact .
fortunately we have digital tv and were able to switch to the alternative commentary , which was much better .
the other interactive services also added a lot to the programme .
justin hughes , reading , uk really really good .
i thoroughly enjoyed it , only wish it was on longer !
lisa finnegan , uk the main concept of this episode was that birds ruled the world yet we only saw one species .
this one was flightless - were all the others able to fly and flew off when the cameramen appeared ?
simon heffer , uk as the programme is done in the same style and format as dinosaurs , i think it was -lrb- and will be -rrb- just as good - it 's a winning formula and a great idea as a follow-up .
stuart , uk commission more programmes that will question , challenge and stimulate , not present us with a half-baked cartoon with an ill conceived storyline t mathews , uk i watched walking with dinosaurs and loved every moment , so much that i bought it on dvd .
i 'm a fan of the beeb 's innovative way of approaching unusual nature documentaries , like the truly incredible alien empires -lrb- insects -rrb- and the blue planet .
i could n't be happier with the first episode of walking with beasts , one of the most interesting and least known periods of earth 's history .
brimming with information , ideas , and concepts ; presented with infectious enthusiasm , how can one not feel the spine tingle when the narrator intones - with a detectable impish glee - " this is a world in which birds eat horses " .
i already know i 'll be watching the subsequent episodes , safe in the knowledge they 'll be of the same quality .
the walking with ... series attempt the impossible : to give us humans today a sense of the sheer scale and variety of pre-history , it simultaneously grips and humbles the viewer .
genuine thanks to all production crew involved - you are leading and teaching the world !
awesome stuff .
maartin , nederlands -lrb- british -rrb- the digitally generated creatures were amazingly ' realistic ' , but , i 'm sorry to say , i just was n't particularly interested in the narrative .
phil steer , england walking with beasts was an entertaining ramble - however , will this mark the future of wildlife documentaries ?
what with the amount of endangered species in the world , will the bbc , say in fifty years time , be filming walking with pandas ?
jon , uk i loved the programme and found it entertaining and really believable .
even better than the dinosaurs .
jane newman , uk wow !
love the effects .
this looks to be a very good series .
lauren , uk i thought that it was absolutely rubbish !
the effects were pathetic , the close up models looked too plasticy and the sounds were a shambles .
the bbc is just trying to make as much money from an old idea as possible .
the movements in dinosaurs were not too bad , but in this they were completely pathetic - i had to switch over .
harry , uk i thought it was enthralling and fascinating but i found it very annoying that theories were presented as fact .
some of the " facts " stated with absolute confidence in the show are highly disputed .
george , slough , uk " all make-believe ... "
i would n't agree with that .
it sounds like it should be treated as a work of fiction .
the science behind it is rooted in fact and reason .
although it may not be 100 % correct , that is still not the same as it being a work of fiction and " all make-believe " .
maybe the underlying facts and reason are not put forward enough ?
i think the reason why scientists think the way they do is often missing in science programmes such as walking with beasts .
it is not just a case of looking at a fossil and then dreaming up a beast .
there is a process of examining multiple facts , each with multiple explanations , and finding the common explanation that ties them all together , sort of like the way a detective solves a crime or the way a sceptic thinks about ufos .
it is the facts and the thinking that makes this more than fiction .
andrew wallace , sweden i really enjoyed the first episode .
it was a shame though that only sky digital had the option of choosing which voiceover to have , as i would have liked to have heard the other factual commentary .
i hope the dvd contains both options when it is produced .
as to complaints about accuracy , what do people expect ?
these animals have been extinct for millenia and all praise to the teams involved for putting together such an interesting programme with such little information .
keep it up .
chris , uk the bbc has obviously spent huge amounts of our money on what will doubtless be a very popular series .
however , the " small dinosaur eaten by big dinosaur " storyline has been done to death now .
do us all a favour , dyke , and commission more programmes that will question , challenge and stimulate , not present us with a half-baked cartoon with an ill conceived storyline .
t mathews , uk more a case of hype over quality .
some of the scenes were very poor .
in one it looked as if frames had been removed as the little creature jumped .
andrew puto , uk very interesting , i 've often wondered how the post-dinosaur world started out .
i commend the bbc for bringing science to life , even if a lot of artistic licence has been used to achieve it .
martin holmes , uk finally a programme that justifies digital tv rb , uk i was disappointed with this production , it was a poor attempt at a documentary on the beasts as if they were actually alive and being filmed .
the animals were personified far too much .
the little family of kangaroo mice things were almost comical in the way they were reacting to each other and their surroundings , almost as if they were theme park characters dressed up to entertain children .
you would have thought that the animators of the animals had never even seen a wild animal before .
let alone studied their interactions .
it was almost as if the animals were having conversations with each other .
animals that do n't talk rely on body language to communicate mood and intent , none of which was evident in the animals featured in the show .
if the makers of the show were intending to make a cute fictitious story for children to enjoy , they probably did a good job .
as a nature documentary , it did n't convince me .
alex dale , uk i was disappointed .
the creatures ' behaviour and characteristics were not researched to the same level to those featured in dinosaurs .
because of that , wild guesses have been made , guesses which seem to be somewhat romantic rather than boring and serious .
if it 's worth doing , do it properly .
robbo , england finally a programme that justifies digital tv , and shows how it can be used to genuinely enhance a show , even if you could only get the full effect on sky .
after about 5 minutes we switched over to the much better in depth soundtrack and then at the end watched the re-run of the programme with the evidence , which really was a different programme in its own right .
is it as good as walking with dinosaurs ?
no - it is much better .
the lack of nauseating commentary -lrb- or at least being able to switch to an alternative -rrb- makes it worthy of being called a science programme rather than entertainment .
rb , uk fantastic effects and graphics , let down by a script unnecessarily dramatised and full of clichÃ©s .
i would liked to have seen a few more facts supporting their interpretation of this ancient world .
martin , uk i never subscribed to the swooning over dinosaurs myself .
if you ignored the admittedly wonderful pictures and concentrated on the commentary , it was cod-science of the worst sort .
i happened to turn on beasts last night , and the first thing i heard ?
" such and such is a mammal , and therefore spends a lot of time looking after her brood . "
the only person who could reliably attest to this is doctor who , and i did n't see his name in the end credits .
it seems to me that these sorts of programmes fall between two stools - science and entertainment - and end up being unsatisfactory on both counts .
the makers should either make a feature film with these animals as the stars -lrb- a la a bug 's life -rrb- or write a reliable and accurate commentary .
for instance , " such and such is a mammal , and therefore it is quite likely that she spends a lot of time looking after her brood . "
picky maybe , but then science is picky .
edward , uk will they oust harry potter ?
jerry hughes , england it was absolutely a case of style over substance .
that in itself is n't a problem , but the programme masquerades as " natural history " .
it is n't , it 's speculation .
if there was more of an admission of this , then i would respect the programme more .
until then , i 'll stick to the much more exciting blue planet - real animals are more fascinating .
andy cotgreave , uk well paced , excellently produced with clear but not obtrusive narration .
the first programme kept not only 10 and 12-year-old children of this household , but also adults enthralled - and that was before we reviewed everything again on digital !
the extra information on the digital channel , ranging from the making of , supporting evidence and modern day corollaries was truly superb .
the potential of this form of tv is massive both in education and entertainment terms and the bbc should be congratulated for excellent use of this media .
in comparison to walking with dinosaurs , this series looks to be a step up in terms of narration , information available -lrb- if you have digital -rrb- and graphics -lrb- the movements of the animals is so realistic , it is as if they have been filmed live in the wild - although the faces of the miniature horses did look a bit like cuddly toys ! -rrb-
undoubtedly the video and dvd versions of this will find their way onto christmas lists world wide - perhaps even furry models of these extinct animals will make it there too - but will they oust harry potter ?
well done the bbc !
jerry hughes , england the kids and i loved it , although i do find the factual presentation of what is supposition difficult to latch on to at times .
stuart e , uk very good , but the frequent prompts in the interactive version were annoying .
it was better watching it normally .
colin denholm , uk very enjoyable .
the graphics were unbelievable and sometimes you had to remind yourself they were computer graphics , not real animals .
but this does n't take away from the learning factor .
if anything it helps it in getting people interested and then intrigued in the animal life of so long ago .
excellent work , it would always be hard to live up to dinosaurs as they have always had the public interest but walking with beasts is a worthy follow up - well done .
gerard mclaughlin , n.ireland i loved dinosaurs and hoped that beasts could live up to the standards set by its predecessor .
if the first episode is anything to go by , me , and i suspect millions of others , wo n't be disappointed .
awe inspiring stuff once again .
i am especially looking forward to meeting the mammoths and sabre-toothed cats in the coming weeks .
andrew watt , scotland i was expecting technical improvements over walking with dinosaurs , especially in the area of the dynamics .
unfortunately many of the large beasties move as if they have zero mass , the small ones as if they have too much inertia , and gravity appears to act in sharp tugs instead of a constant force .
next time , get a physicist to check your work .
chris butterworth , uk i enjoyed the programme .
it 's interesting to learn about creatures from this interim period , which are so different to what came before and after them .
but a little more background and context would have improved the format .
alastair stevens , cambridge , uk it may well be make believe but it looked very real to me .
i had to look away at some of the scenes of predators eating their prey .
excellent graphics , highly entertaining and a welcome change from game shows and soaps !
for once , i did n't have to resort to finding something interesting on the sky channels .
jacky , uk i only miss attenborough 's commentary .
it gives the viewer a glimpse into an era never seen like this before .
programmes like this make it worth paying your tv licence !
ton zwartjens , uk i think that provided you bear in mind there is a lot of supposition going on , as is always the case with pre-historical subjects , then walking with beasts is an excellent programme .
when science is made both entertaining and educational , someone somewhere has done a marvellous job and deserves the viewers ' congratulations .
bill , uk only the first episode , so not willing to utterly condemn it yet -lrb- i thought the first episode of dinosaurs was a bit weak too . -rrb-
major problem is that it is harder to imitate fur and feathers than it is lizard skin - see jurassic park and final fantasy for hollywood 's attempt at them .
the images also suffer from being too " clean " - that is , you can tell they are computer generated because they just standout slightly from the backdrops - the twitching hoppy thing was bouncing through leaf litter without disturbing a single thing !
the " story " method of telling each episode is good - but is far too doom-laden .
everytime something was described it was " but ... danger lurks , no ordinary night , deadly surprise etc etc ... "
and the biggest bugbear of all - but i already know your arguments over this - it is all pure supposition - you can not predict behaviour !
but i 'd give it 6 out of 10 and cross my fingers the next episode is better -lrb- i think it will be - far more interested in big animals than little hoppy fluffy things -rrb- .
graham tubbs , uk a very enjoyable programme .
it both showed how far computer graphics has come and how far it has yet to go .
my main worry is accuracy as the wildlife documentary style means it was all portrayed as fact whereas i suspect that much of it was conjecture .
rob hayward , england great animation , but i 've never heard of any of the beasts in the first episode !
iain , uk like walking with dinosaurs , walking with beasts is a triumph ; however , the same flaws exist .
while kenneth brannagh is an excellent actor , his narration does not suit - he attempts to add too much drama through his voice , when music and the images alone could achieve this far better .
secondly , the ' script ' continues to speak of things as if they are facts when they are in fact merely conjecture .
admittedly this may be required to make the series more watchable , but it is highly misleading .
a slight rephrasing would make the script far less inaccurate .
these issues aside , the series is a joy to watch .
matthew dale , uk the interactive tv features enhanced the programme enormously , if this is what tv will be like in the future , roll on the future !
alistair smith , uk excellent , even better than before .
caroline , uk the programme was not nearly as good as the dinosaurs both technically and in content .
i thought that the little horse things were poorly animated and the whale thing standing on the lake bed was very similar in the day and at night .
it would have been good to see the monkey things surviving the co2 attack because they were up in the trees and co2 is too heavy to get up to them .
erik bean , uk i thoroughly enjoyed the first programme .
unfortunately there was so much other information available via the remote control that i was in danger of missing the programme itself .
what would be useful would be to keep the active feature available through the following programme so that i can watch the episode and then take time to access the wealth of additional information .
well done , bbc .
andrea , uk excellent stuff !
it had me convinced it was real - it will be added to my list of weekly viewing , definitely elaine , ireland fantastic !
j , scotland fascinating and a good visual treat .
just as good as its predecessor .

bbc news -pipe- showbiz -pipe- downey jr vows to beat drugs categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : entertainment : showbiz front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 16 november , 2001 , 08:36 gmt downey jr vows to beat drugs downy jr was a hit in ally mcbeal with calista flockhart actor robert downey jr has described his wholehearted bid to beat his addiction to drugs to a judge in california .
the star , who was once oscar-nominated for chaplin , also said that he was determined to return to the big screen one day .
downey jr was appearing at a court hearing on thursday to evaluate his progress since he was placed on probation in july for drug offences .
superior court judge randall white said it appeared downey was doing well and set another progress hearing for next march .
furthering my endeavour in recovery is really my priority for right now robert downey jr downey jr told the judge : " furthering my endeavour in recovery is really my priority for right now . "
downey jr said he had been spending time with his son and his family .
" i 've been able to re-establish contact with my family .
that 's the only privilege i consider myself really to have at this point . "
the actor 's attorney said downey jr would continue treatment at the wavelengths international rehabilitation centre in malibu for another four months and possibly a year .
arrest downey jr was sentenced to a year at a live-in rehabilitation centre and three years of probation in july following his arrest on drug charges in palm springs in november .
he was also ordered to pay a series of fines and was ordered to comply with a set of regulations including random drug testing .
downey jr following his april arrest downey jr was arrested at an hotel in palm springs in november last year , three months after his release from a year-long jail term .
downey jr has been in a residential drug treatment programme since a second arrest - without charge - in april in los angeles .
police arrested the star in a back alley on suspicion of drug use while on parole .
a urine sample later tested positive for cocaine but no prosecution was ever brought .
career downey jr 's drug problems have hampered his attempts to rebuild his once promising career .
he landed a regular role on hit comedy ally mcbeal - even winning an emmy .
but his arrest in april forced scriptwriters to rewrite the season ending .
the actor 's drug problems first hit the headlines in 1996 when police found cocaine , heroin and a pistol in his vehicle after he was stopped for speeding .
a month later , he was found passed out in a neighbour 's house and was hospitalised at a substance abuse treatment centre .

once the tracks have been chosen and loaded into a computer in digital format , the hpdj program analyzes each track .
dave cliff came up with the idea for the hpdj a club dj typically builds tempo gradually , placing slower numbers at the end .
in the same way , the computer programme measures tempo in beats per minute to decide on an order for the tunes .
the system also imitates a real dj by altering the tempo , slowing down or increasing the speed of the music to make a seamless mix .
the computer actually stretches out the beats to make them match from track to track .
" the human brain is not very good at recognizing small changes in the number of beats per minute , and this is the sort of thing that a computer does really well , " said mr cliff .

about 100 members of the special boat service -lrb- sbs -rrb- arrived at the bagram airbase near kabul on thursday to carry out a fact-finding mission .
the troops will begin by hunting for mines and liaising with the northern alliance to ensure the area is suitable for further flights bringing in both more troops and humanitarian supplies .
the sas has already been operating in afghanistan for some time , and the sbs is the royal marines ' equivalent service .
taking prompt action is an important way of helping to secure the advances that have already been made foreign secretary jack straw some royal marine commandos and members of the parachute regiment could follow the sbs into the country by the end of the weekend , according to the bbc 's defence correspondent paul adams .
the move to send in an advance party of british troops coincided with an announcement that the uk is to send its first diplomat to kabul since 1989 following the withdrawal of the taleban regime .
defined tasks speaking on the bbc 's today programme , foreign secretary jack straw said the sbs were in bagram to secure the airport and make it safe for humanitarian and diplomatic missions .
he said the involvement of british troops in a full scale military civil war was " not on the agenda " .
" these forces have gone in for very specific task to break up the al-qaeda network , to seek out bin laden and his associates and to ensure the end of the taleban , " he said .
but he accepted that if you put a military force in on the ground it could get involved in " conflict that is unanticipated . "

earlier he announced that british diplomat stephen evans would be helping opposition forces set up a broad-based government .
" taking prompt action is an important way of helping to secure the advances that have already been made during the course of the week , " mr straw said .

as well as the british troops , 60 french troops are to travel to uzbekistan on friday , and will continue to mazar-e-sharif and help the aid effort there .
a senior british defence source said on thursday : " i can confirm that some of our forces are on the ground in northern afghanistan , having arrived at bagram airport at 1200gmt .
blair " optimistic " about peace in afghanistan bagram airport , situated about 10 miles north-east of kabul , is considered to be of key strategic importance .
last sunday , defence secretary geoff hoon confirmed that british troops were already on the ground in afghanistan .
it is thought that the uk forces involved were members of the sas .
a ministry of defence spokesman said although there were a large number of british troops on standby , " there is no assumption yet that they are definitely going to be deployed " .
frontline duties thousands of uk troops will remain on 48-hour standby to go to afghanistan , mod sources said .
the units on standby are said to include the 2nd battalion the parachute regiment , the entire 45 commando of the royal marines , and elements from 16 air assault brigade and 3 commando brigade .
mr blair has said they could be used in future frontline offensives against the taleban , although protection of humanitarian supplies and ' stabilising ' work would be the priority .

why are the elections a watershed ?
the elections return to kosovo the extensive self-rule which it once enjoyed within yugoslavia .
in 1989 slobodan milosevic imposed direct rule from belgrade , and the repression that followed , created growing resentment among kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority who account for well over 80 % of its two million inhabitants .
a police crackdown in 1998 triggered an uprising among the ethnic albanians .
further acts of brutality against albanian civilians led to a military intervention by nato to avert , as it put it , " a humanitarian catastrophe " .
since 1999 kosovo has been run by the united nations ' mission in kosovo -lrb- unmik -rrb- .
security has been provided by a nato-led peacekeeping force , known as k-for .
what are they voting for ?
kosovo 's voters will be electing , through a proportional system , a 120-member assembly .
as a form of " positive discrimination " , 10 seats are reserved for serbs and another 10 for the other ethnic minorities , mostly roma , turks and bosniaks .
the assembly will elect a president .
the administration will be in the hands of a government , that will need to receive a vote of confidence in the assembly .
the new government will replace the current unelected power-sharing executive which brings together un officials with representatives of the main local communities .
unmik will keep control of foreign affairs , monetary policy , justice and public order .
it will also be able to veto all measures that appear to violate un resolutions on kosovo .
k-for will continue to look after defence and security .
who are the main contenders ?
the three ethnic albanian parties , that emerged with well over 90 % of the votes in the october 2000 municipal elections , are expected to repeat their earlier electoral performance .
the democratic league of kosovo -lrb- ldk -rrb- , under its long-standing pacifist leader , ibrahim rugova , appears to be on target to garner an overall majority of the vote once again .
the democratic party of kosovo -lrb- pdk -rrb- , headed by hashim thaci , is the political successor to the kosovo liberation army -lrb- kla -rrb- , which was disbanded after the conflict .
it is hoping to do better than last year when it gained only half as many votes as the ldk .
the alliance for the future of kosovo -lrb- aak -rrb- , led by a former kla commander ramush haradinaj , split away from the pdk last year .
it hopes to emerge as a viable third force on the political scene .
will the serbs take part ?
kosovo 's serbs boycotted the municipal elections largely in protest against their lack of protection from continuing revenge attacks by ethnic albanian militants .
this time they have registered to vote .
they are also being advised by belgrade to take part in the elections so that they can have a voice in kosovo 's future .
but there are sections within the politically fragmented serb minority who are not willing to join the main serb umbrella group - known as the coalition for return - and take part in the elections .
why now ?
un resolution 1244 which set up , in effect , a un protectorate in kosovo , pledged to establish " substantial autonomy " for the entity .
with two-and-a-half years gone since unmik took control of kosovo , the time is ripe to press on with the objective of handing over some of unmik 's authority to local representatives .
there is an expectation that it will be easier to integrate the serb minority into kosovo 's political life if substantial numbers of serbs turn up to vote .
what about kosovo 's future status ?
the international community wants to accommodate a self-governing kosovo within the framework of yugoslavia - as envisaged in resolution 1244 .
the election of a new kosovo administration will make it possible to launch talks - under the un 's aegis - on kosovo 's future status .
for their part , the main kosovo albanian parties are united in their demand for independence .
after the elections , the newly-elected authorities are likely to call with even greater vigour for a referendum on the issue .

you need to organise it in a way that we go for the law and not for the law of the jungle unhcr head ruud lubbers mr lubbers said while he understood australia 's concerns about people smuggling , canberra should stick to international agreements rather than act unilaterally .
in august , prime minister john howard ordered naval forces to start turning boat people away from australian waters in an effort to deter the multi-million-dollar trade in people smuggling .
his government - re-elected on sunday on a hardline immigration platform - has hit back at the un agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , accusing it of squandering its resources .
waste australian immigration minister philip ruddock said the unhcr had spent hundreds of millions of dollars each year looking after some 21 million refugees .
" it is an obscene waste of resources for a system which is about to collapse , " mr ruddock told australia 's abc radio .
the minister said on top of the money the unhcr spends , developed countries also had to foot a multi-billion-dollar bill for an asylum seeker system under which only one in 10 people are entitled to refugee status .
he also rejected criticism by the unhcr and amnesty international of australia 's policy of processing claims of asylum seekers on small pacific islands .
since august , hundreds of refugees have been shipped and flown to detention camps set up by australia on the impoverished pacific nations of nauru and papua new guinea .
this week it asked the tiny , island nation of tuvalu to take in asylum seekers , despite turning down tuvalu 's own request for asylum in june .
tuvalu had asked australia to take in some of its people of fears over rising sea waters .
mr lubbers also said he disagreed with suggestions made by mr howard during australia 's recent federal election campaign that terrorists could infiltrate australia on boats carrying asylum seekers .
" the people who have to flee their countries are the victims of terrorism .
they are not terrorists , " he said .

us homeland security director tom ridge said the information could have been found on the internet and it did not mean bin laden was able to build a nuclear device .
we have to be prepared for all eventualities , including a nuclear threat tom ridge , us homeland security director " much of that information could have been taken right off the internet some years ago .
so there is nothing unusual about that information , " said mr ridge .
it comes after britain 's times newspaper said one of its reporters found the papers , which were partly burned , as the city was taken over by northern alliance fighters .
mr ridge said their discovery was consistent with statements made by bin laden - the main suspect in the 11 september suicide hijackings - that he wanted to acquire a nuclear capability .
the documents explained how to detonate explosives to compress plutonium and trigger a thermonuclear reaction .
they were in arabic , german , urdu and english .
plans for poison the documents are also said to have contained formulae for producing a lethal biological poison , ricin .
ricin , which is derived from a toxin protein in castor oil seed , was used to kill bulgarian dissident georgi markov in london in 1978 .
nuclear experts quoted by the times said that the design in the documents suggested that bin laden might have been working on a fission device , similar to the bomb dropped on nagasaki in 1945 .
however , the experts said , building a viable warhead was extremely difficult .
uk defence secretary geoff hoon dismissed a recent claim by bin laden to possess a nuclear bomb , but said that intelligence services did believe that al-qaeda might have obtained nuclear material .
such material is not hard to come by , the director of a moscow think-tank has told the bbc .
smuggling from russia in russia , two men have been arrested for trying to sell cobalt-60 , a radioactive material that can be used to carry out a radioactive terrorist attacks .
cobalt 60 is widely used , not only in the military , but also in civilian industry ivan savranchuk ivan savranchuk , the director of the centre for defence information , told the bbc that this was not the first case of people being arrested for attempting to smuggle or sell radioactive materials .
he said cobalt-60 could easily be obtained from the civilian industry , where it is used for medical engineering purposes .
he emphasized , however , that the material could not be used for making a nuclear bomb - but could be used on a smaller scale , with conventional weapons that could spread radioactivity .
other documents found by the times reporter included instructions on how to develop a " supergun " and build smaller bombs , the paper said .

dell has been suffering from the intense price war between personal computer makers , fierce rivalry that dell itself initiated .
but the results , which were earned on revenues of $ 7.5bn , were still better than analysts had expected , and the company insisted its finances had not been hurt by the aftermath of 11 september .
although lowering prices may have dented the firm 's bottomline , it has successfully been gaining market share from its competitors , including compaq , hewlett-packard and gateway .
" by consistently meeting customer requirements , we 're gaining -lsb- market -rsb- share faster than ever in dell 's history , " said the firm in a statement .
government boost the latest research shows that dell has now won about 27 % of the total personal computer market .
strong government sales , traditionally a key feature for dell in the third quarter , also helped ensure its financial targets were met .
and it replaced 10,000 computer systems in the first two days after the 11 september attacks on the world trade centre and the pentagon .
this helped offset the slump in demand for personal computers on the back of the global economic slowdown .
and the firm said that its strong relationships with vendors and its management of the supply chain insulated it from the wider slump .
