duffy will not have reassured her otherwise as he offered on wednesday to do a naked workout if big brother would give him some olive oil in return .
the disembodied voice of big brother was not sure how this would benefit the house , and instead told jack dee he would have to clean all mirrors in the house before receiving anything in return .
" that 's terrible , " said comedian dee .
" those cheeky buggers .
i 'll ask for a clove of garlic as well . "
but it has emerged that dee was not so brave when caught with his trousers down when turner forgot to knock before entering the communal toilet .

turner thought the incident was hilarious , but dee did not see the funny side .
feltz has not seen the funny side of big brother at all .

" i think reality tv programmes do a lot of damage .
" nothing prepares you for scrutiny and incarceration and worrying what people might think of you and trying to survive all at once .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- obsessives risk heart attacks low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo thursday , 15 march , 2001 , 06:32 gmt obsessives risk heart attacks anxiety and obsessive habits lead to an increased risk of heart attack anxious or obsessive people are at increased risk of heart attacks , a uk study has shown .
and a dutch study has revealed depression increases the risk of dying from heart disease , whether or not a person already had cardiac problems .
the 20-year examination of more than 1,400 uk men initially quizzed them about their obsessive habits , such as sticking to a routine , being excessively meticulous and disliking sudden change .
it also looked at signs of anxiety , such as sweating , sleep disturbance and indigestion .
the 127 who have died of a heart attack during the two decades covered by the study had higher scores for obsessive habits and anxiety symptoms .
depression increases the risk of dying from heart disease the research team from london medical schools say more work is needed to find out how the symptoms increase the risk of a heart attack .
professor andy haines , who led the study , which is published in heart journal , said he also wanted to examine the effect of psychological interventions , such as cognitive behavioural therapy .
he told bbc news online : " in general terms men often wo n't tend to go to the doctor with psychological symptoms .
and if they are not going to the doctor , they do n't see it as a problem . "
he said the study had confirmed obsessive tendencies and symptoms of anxiety were an increased risk factor , but that it was not yet known why .
no heart disease history the men in the study , aged between 40 and 64 , were recruited from three occupational groups in north-west london , and were not under the care of a doctor .
they had no heart disease problems when they joined the study , after being recruited via letters to their companies .
they answered a psychological questionnaire , which allocated points to various areas of mental health , allowing researchers to measure the scale of psychological problems .
each one point increase in the scores for obsessive habits and anxiety symptoms increased the relative risk of heart attack by 8 % .
the men who died had higher overall scores .
a 10-point increase was linked to a 28 % higher risk of a fatal attack .
phobias also increased the risk of an attack by 7 % per point , but only for those men who died within the first 10 years of the study .
depressed heart attack patients risk another attack information on deaths among the group was taken from the nhs central register .
the researchers studied the health records of the 127 who died , and their responses to the questionnaire .
the study 's findings take into account risk factors such as smoking , age and social class .
depression link the dutch study looked at 2,900 people between 55 and 85 years old over four and a half years .
it found that among those patients who did not have heart disease , but who did have major depression , deaths related to the heart disease almost quadrupled .
death rates tripled in those who already had heart disease when the study began , and who developed depression .
the british heart foundation -lrb- bhf -rrb- has said a patient who is seriously depressed after a heart attack is over three times more likely to have a second attack than a patient who is not depressed .
it added that working in a stressful job with little control over work increases the risk of coronary heart disease by more than 50 % compared to having a job with more control of variety and pace of work .
' social crutches ' melanie raddon , a cardiac nurse for the bhf , said it had also identified a possible link between psychological factors like anger , depression and anxiety and coronary heart disease , though again it was not known why .
but she added : " this research has accounted for the effects of some risk factors such as smoking .
" however it is clear that anxiety can lead to a less healthy lifestyle and reliance on ' social crutches ' such as comfort food and alcohol .
" while these secondary factors are important , further research is necessary to establish what direct affects , if any , our state of mind has on our hearts . "

wales office minister david hanson has been appointed a member of the task force - following criticism that its role was being confined to england .
the creation of the rural relief panel was announced as the number of outbreaks topped 200 .
on tuesday , downing street insisted that the taskforce would cover only england - and the assembly 's rural affairs minister , carwyn jones said wales was too small to justify having its own panel .
the government has promised to make a decision " within the next 48 hours " on the fate of thousands of livestock about to give birth .
the options for pregnant ewes - which can not be taken to lambing sheds because of movement bans - include leaving them where they are , allowing closely-enforced transportation , or mass slaughter .
welsh rural affairs minister carwyn jones has been holding talks with his uk counterparts in london on the worsenig crisis .
the meeting comes as three new cases are confirmed in wales - bringing the total to 12 .
the latest sites are all in powys - at a farm near llanfair caereinion , the hamer abattoir in llanidloes , and a farm at brook near welshpool .
mr jones 's trip to london follows an admission that the welsh assembly would not have the resources to help the rural economy in wales .
farmers are also reeling from the news that they may not be able to export their animals until christmas - 10 months after the outbreak in wales .
meanwhile , the assembly is preparing 30,000 advice letters to send out to farmers in wales .
the letters will include details of the symptoms of the disease , details of the licence system for the movement of livestock for slaughter , and the limited movement of animals for welfare reasons .
talks are being held with the post office on how the letters will be delivered .
mr jones confirmed on tuesday that restrictions would mean farmers would not be able to export their animals even if there was an immediate end to the crisis .
we are facing a national disaster , which fully justifies the use of the army bob parry , fuw president the number of confirmed cases in the uk now stands at 217 .
meanwhile , farmers in wales have called for the army to be brought in to help speed up the disposal of animals slaughtered because of foot-and-mouth .
a spokesman for the barracks at brecon in powys confirmed on tuesday that marksmen had been put on standby by the ministry of agriculture .
bob parry , president of the farmers ' union of wales , has said he believes the situation is severe enough to be declared a national crisis .
" we are facing a national disaster , which fully justifies the use of the army , " he said .
fellow farmer mick bates - who is the liberal democrats ' spokesman on agriculture in the welsh assembly - has supported the call .
" we need more resources , " said mr bates , who farms in montgomeryshire .
farming leaders from wales travelled to downing street on tuesday , where new emergency measures were agreed .
details of revised procedures are expected to be revealed on wednesday .
meanwhile , an emergency scheme to support people on anglesey - one of the worst affected areas - has begun .
operation phoenix will be a one-stop shop for people with problems , supported by the council , farming unions , the tourist board , welsh development agency , and the benefits agency .
fresh worries about the disease emerged on monday with news that a group of sheep which arrived at a mid wales abattoir may have been carrying it .
the arrival of 23 suspect lambs at the slaughterhouse in llanidloes had brought into question the new system of allowing animals to be taken for slaughter from unaffected areas .
despite the rush of new outbreaks the uk agriculture minister nick brown is still adamant that the situation is under control .
incubation but welsh politicians are taking a more cautious view .
carwyn jones said on monday he hoped the picture across wales would be clearer soon .
" the incubation period in sheep is three weeks , but the order forbidding movement of animals has only been in place for two weeks , " he said .
" so it is possible that the symptoms we are seeing in sheep now are as a result of sheep picking up the disease before it was known that foot-and-mouth was in the uk . "
concern " hopefully , by friday we will have a better idea of where the disease in wales , " said mr jones .
the unconfirmed case at bancyfelin near st clears is the greatest concern for more than 3,000 farmers .
it is an important milk producing region which so far appears to have escaped the epidemic .
if it proves positive it could signal the most serious development yet in the spread of the disease .

fresh worries about the disease emerged on monday with news that a group of sheep which arrived at a mid wales abattoir may have been carrying it .
the arrival of 23 suspect lambs at the slaughterhouse in llanidloes had brought into question the new system of allowing animals to be taken for slaughter from unaffected areas .
despite the rush of new outbreaks the uk agriculture minister nick brown is still adamant that the situation is under control .
incubation but welsh politicians are taking a more cautious view .
carwyn jones said on monday he hoped the picture across wales would be clearer soon .
" the incubation period in sheep is three weeks , but the order forbidding movement of animals has only been in place for two weeks , " he said .
" so it is possible that the symptoms we are seeing in sheep now are as a result of sheep picking up the disease before it was known that foot-and-mouth was in the uk . "
concern " hopefully , by friday we will have a better idea of where the disease in wales , " said mr jones .
the unconfirmed case at bancyfelin near st clears is the greatest concern for more than 3,000 farmers .
it is an important milk producing region which so far appears to have escaped the epidemic .
if it proves positive it could signal the most serious development yet in the spread of the disease .

a new bill will make it a crime not only to produce or transmit indecent images of children , but also to access them .
the bill will also allow prosecutions in canada for offences committed abroad .
the canadian justice minister , anne mclellan , said the bill was intended to keep pace with new technology , which she said was being used to commit horrible crimes .
" all of us have an obligation to watch carefully and try and destroy these pernicious , ugly activities that prey upon children in our society , " she said .
jail sentences offences such as transmitting child pornography by e-mail , providing child porn web site addresses or exporting it from canada would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison .
accessing child pornography would mean a jail sentence of up to five years .
the bill is not meant to catch people who inadvertently open e-mail attachments or web pages that have child pornography , but those who " knowingly cause child pornography to be viewed , " said a justice official said .
the legislation also clamps down on those who try to lure minors into sexual contact through the internet .
but internet service providers in canada have warned that , although they are willing to close down child pornography websites if they are ordered to , the new measure will be difficult to police .
mrs mclellan declined to say how the new law would be enforced , turning that matter over to the police .
the bbc 's correspondent in toronto , lee carter , says the bill is almost certain to become law because the governing liberals have a majority in the federal parliament .
the legislation has been welcomed by authorities such as the ontario provincial police 's child pornography unit - one of the most sophisticated teams of its kind in the world .
in canada , the us and many other jurisdictions , it is already a crime to possess child pornography downloaded from a computer .

from wednesday , eight million copies of the new asterix comic book , asterix and latraviata are on sale across europe .
it has been five years since writer and illustrator albert uderzo released the last asterix adventure and there have been many rumours about his return .
unusually , the new story contains a love interest - the beautiful roman actress latraviata - but it also contains plenty of battles with romans and begins and ends with the traditional roast boar banquet .
so french it was reported that at one busy bookshop opposite the saint lazaire railway station in paris buyers were sitting down in the shop to read the new story .
" they 're so well drawn , " reader virginie marion told a reporter as she bought a copy of the book .
" and the characters are so french , not like the japanese and american comics . "
a survey in february revealed that the pugnacious little gaul was the favourite cartoon character of 53 per cent of french people .
forty years on the first asterix book , asterix the gaul , was published in 1961 , two years after the character appeared as a strip in the weekly comic pilote .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- alder hey doctors reported to gmc low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo thursday , 15 march , 2001 , 09:00 gmt alder hey doctors reported to gmc doctors criticised in the alder hey inquiry have been referred to the general medical council a number of doctors named in the report into the organ scandal at alder hey children 's hospital have been reported to the general medical council .
estimates in one national newspaper suggest as many as 16 have been referred to the gmc by the chief medical officer professor liam donaldson .
the redfern inquiry , published in january , said thousands of dead children had had organs removed at the liverpool hospital over seven years , without their parents consent .
in some cases , it was many years after their child 's death that parents learnt organs had been kept .
some families have had to have funeral after funeral as lungs , brains , hearts and other organs were returned to them .
at the same time as the redfern inquiry reported , professor donaldson warned there may be over 100,000 organs stored in hospitals across england .
van velzen professor dick van velzen , head of foetal and infant pathology at alder hey between 1988 and 1995 , was named by the redfern report as being at the centre of the scandal .
in february , the gmc suspended him .
the council 's professional conduct committee will now begin an investigation into professor van velzen 's work .
if found guilty of serious professional misconduct he could be permanently erased from the medical register .
health secretary alan milburn said doctors named in the redfern report would be referred to the gmc when he responded to the report in the house of commons on january 30 .
a spokeswoman for the department of health said : " the report of the inquiry into alder hey was passed to the gmc by the department of health drawing attention to the fact that it made criticisms of a number of doctors .
" the gmc consideration of the report led to the decision to impose an interim suspension on dr van velzen .
" it is for the gmc to assess whether criticisms made of other doctors in the report warrant any further action . "
the department would not confirm how many doctors had been referred .
a gmc spokesman said it was " unique " for the chief medical officer to refer doctors .
she added : " alder hey was not an every day set of circumstances .
" it was an inquiry set up by the secretary of state so we are not surprised the chief medical officer wants to bring matters to our attention . "
referrals to the doctors ' regulatory body more usually come from hospital trusts and health authorities .
the redfern inquiry report said " managerial inadequacy " had been a factor in the scandal .
at the time four nhs staff , including the chief executive of alder hey , hilary rowlands , were suspended .
the report names a number of doctors , but it is not yet clear which of them has been referred to the gmc .
the referral of a doctor to the council does not imply they are guilty .
dr michael goodman , deputy chairman of the bma 's consultants committee told the independent he was concerned about the gmc referrals .
" i hope it is not political and the chief medical officer has been careful and thoughtful about who he thought necessary to refer to the gmc .
" we need to make sure the chief medical officer is not allowing the good name of his office to be part of any politically-motivated which-hunt . "
