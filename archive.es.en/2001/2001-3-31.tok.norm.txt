dozens of local journalists converged on the milosevic villa in the capital 's exclusive suburb of dedinje .
live phone-ins were soon aired on most of the radio and tv stations , but there were no live pictures from the spot .
at about 2000 local time -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- , the independent b92 radio and television station said mr milosevic had been arrested , and shortly afterwards the same news was heard on state-run television .
that was when the confusion began in earnest , with reporters rushing downtown to the city 's main courtroom and back to the residence , where they soon started ducking for cover when the first shots were heard behind the high brick walls .
no official reaction through the night , both the state run television and independent media continued with live reports and special programmes , but the confusion was heightened by a total lack of official reaction and a rather strange lack of interest by the goverment .
the serbian and yugoslav justice ministers , when contacted by phone , offered just a terse " no comment " , and the minister of police switched off his cellphone .
serbian prime minister zoran djindjic told reporters that he was watching the film gladiator with his son and that he knew nothing about the arrest .

at least 10 major productions are due to open in just a few weeks .
the major attraction is a stage adaptation of the 1968 mel brooks screen musical comedy classic the producers .
the show arrives on broadway with strong word of mouth following a chicago try-out .
this is a tale of theatre producers who create a deliberately tasteless show in which adolf hitler is the leading character .
the show stars matthew broderick and nathan lane .
mel brooks has written both the book and the music .
extravaganza another big musical production that also has roots in a movie is a revival of 42nd street which will open early in may .
this song and dance spectacular , which was first produced on broadway in 1980 , is a show within a show .
it deals with the backstage drama and romance of a 30s musical with a cast of relative unknowns .
but according to its director mark bramble , the 1980 production has been totally revamped and given a 21st century view .
when it comes to plays , transatlantic imports feature prominently .
a revival of noel coward 's 30s comedy design for living has already opened sporting a cast that includes alan cumming and jennifer ehle .
both leads are popular with audiences for their previous new york work which earned them both tony awards - broadway 's most prestigious stage accolade .
cumming is extremely popular after having made a spectacular impression on us theatergoers with his electric performance in the role of mc in a 1998 revival of cabaret .
design for living chronicles a menage à trois which seems remarkably modern for a play noel coward wrote 70 years ago .
jennifer ehle says : " it surprised me how many serious things he says in it .
" i thought it was actually incredibly up-to-the-minute and very , very relevant , and it 's fun . "
ehle plays a woman torn between a soulless marriage of convenience and two men with whom she 's been intimately linked .
the men have also been romantically involved with one another .
ultimately the three decide they have no alternative but to live together .
cumming says he really liked the subject matter .
" if you have a passion for something , you have to find it and fulfil it and in this case it 's an unusual passion .
i 'm quite interested in those issues . "
buzz opening this weekend is stones in his pockets , the critically acclaimed irish play from actor-writer marie jones .
it has already been staged in belfast , dublin , scotland and the west end .
two actors , sean campion and conleth hill portray " extras " in an american film which is being shot on location in county kerry .
campion and hill play 15 parts in the course of the play which arrives on broadway with a strong buzz .
the invention of love , a new york première of a tom stoppard play first seen on the london stage in 1997 , has also just opened .
stoppard 's drama examines the english poet ae housman , who died in 1936 , and his unrequited lifelong love for another man .
two american actors will play the poet at different ages .
richard easton portrays him at age 77 , while robert sean leonard plays housman as a young man .
other broadway plays include king hedley ii , a new offering from august wilson , one of america 's leading african-american playwrights .
his latest work is set in pittsburgh in the reagan 80 's and focuses on a recently released convict trying to redeem himself .
two holocaust themed dramas will also be present on broadway this season .
judgment at nuremberg has already opened and stars maximilian schell who won an oscar for his role in the film version of the recounting of the 1948 nazi war-crime trials .
the other play is the gathering , set in the 80s , which examines the lingering impact of the holocaust on three generations of a survivor 's family in both the us and germany .
survival although this season is notably lacking in big name stars the casting of film actor gary sinise in a revival of one flew over the cuckoo 's nest has generated considerable interest .
sinise will be trying to grapple with the part of randle patrick mcmurphy - a role that jack nicholson made his own and for which he won an oscar .
terry kinney , the director of this new stage version , claims that his cuckoo 's nest is totally different .
he says it is more balanced than the film because additional weight has been given to the supporting characters .
despite the presence of musical crowd pleasers there is little that is daring or fresh in what remains of the broadway season .
although the slate of offerings will no doubt bring in the tourist dollar , it will do little to revive interest in theatre among young people .
in the past , vibrant american musicals like rent , a chorus line and hair have introduced new generations to theatre as a powerful modern force .
theatre insiders bemoan the lack of anything new and intoxicating on broadway this season to bring in the young audiences that american musical theatre so desperately needs if it is to survive .

police were called to quell the violence at the port hedland centre in north-west australia , which began after three detainees were told they would be sent back to iran .
the country 's tough stance has been criticised in the past by the united nations and human rights groups .
but the government says it has been prompted by a steep rise in the number of people trying to enter the country unlawfully , particularly by boat .
numbers rising last year there were more than 4,100 - the year before fewer than 1,000 .
many of those who arrive have undertaken the perilous sea crossing from indonesia in vessels that are only just afloat .
most of them are from the middle east , particularly afghanistan , iran and iraq , with some from the southern provinces of china .
they come from all backgrounds : doctors , clerical workers , lawyers and mechanics .
australian law means they are sent to one of six detention centres for illegal immigrants , which currently house about 1,900 people .
protests foreseen philip ruddock , the immigration minister , warned last week that there could be further protests at the port hedland centre , which houses most of the detainees who are at the end of their appeal process .
the australian government says that it welcomes more than 49,000 legal migrants each year and that people who enter the country illegally are jumping the queue .
but human rights groups and un committees have criticised the policy of detention , arguing that australia is breaching its international commitments on the treatment of refugees .

the cyber attack - mainly by university students - comes ahead of the final review of the book , which protesters say distorts history and justifies japan 's past wartime aggression against asian countries .
the protesters also targeted four other websites , including those of the publishers of the book and of japan 's governing liberal democratic party .
south korean police said they were monitoring the attack , but taking no action to prevent it .
japanese education ministry officials said access to their website had been made difficult during the attack .
' distortion ' the ministry is to take a final decision on whether to approve the textbook for publication in april , before it becomes part of the curriculum for junior high schools next year .
the controversial book , written by a group of right-wing academics , says asian nations benefited from wartime rule by tokyo , preparing them for independence from western colonisers .
its original draft spoke of japan 's annexation of the korean peninsula in 1910 as being " legitimate " and said the 1937-1938 nanjing massacre in china " was not a holocaust " .
south korea and china have led asian protests over these assertions , which are said to have been revised .
on the anniversary of the independence movement formed to fight the japanese occupation , south korean president kim dae-jung called on tokyo to adhere to what he called " a correct understanding of history " .
he urged japan to continue efforts to develop relationships with his and other countries in the region to overcome the problems of the past .
threatened ties south korean officials have threatened unspecified measures if the book is not revised .
these could include postponing the opening of the korean market to japanese cultural items .
the bbc 's seoul correspondent , caroline gluck , says the protests underline the lingering bitterness in korea over japan 's 35-year occupation of the country .
three years ago , the two countries pledged to improve bilateral ties and enhance forward-looking relations .
since then , south korea has gradually lifted decades-old bans on japanese cultural imports such as films and pop music .
the two countries were controversially named the co-hosts of the 2002 football world cup .
but in what is being seen as a sign of more trouble , hiroshima 's high court on thursday overturned the only compensation award ever made to world war ii sex slaves , prompting outrage in south korea .
presiding judge toshiaki kawanami said abducting the women to use them as forced labourers and sex slaves was not a serious constitutional violation .
a coalition of 22 south korean civic groups furiously condemned the hiroshima ruling .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- attack on japan ministry website low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : asia-pacific front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo saturday , 31 march , 2001 , 12:48 gmt 13:48 uk attack on japan ministry website former ' comfort women ' experienced history first-hand south korean hackers have caused a japanese education ministry website to crash as part of a protest against a controversial history textbook .
the cyber attack - mainly by university students - comes ahead of the final review of the book , which protesters say distorts history and justifies japan 's past wartime aggression against asian countries .
the protesters also targeted four other websites , including those of the publishers of the book and of japan 's governing liberal democratic party .
south korean police said they were monitoring the attack , but taking no action to prevent it .
japanese education ministry officials said access to their website had been made difficult during the attack .
' distortion ' the ministry is to take a final decision on whether to approve the textbook for publication in april , before it becomes part of the curriculum for junior high schools next year .
these people want japan 's young people to study " unbiased " history the controversial book , written by a group of right-wing academics , says asian nations benefited from wartime rule by tokyo , preparing them for independence from western colonisers .
its original draft spoke of japan 's annexation of the korean peninsula in 1910 as being " legitimate " and said the 1937-1938 nanjing massacre in china " was not a holocaust " .
south korea and china have led asian protests over these assertions , which are said to have been revised .
on the anniversary of the independence movement formed to fight the japanese occupation , south korean president kim dae-jung called on tokyo to adhere to what he called " a correct understanding of history " .
he urged japan to continue efforts to develop relationships with his and other countries in the region to overcome the problems of the past .
threatened ties south korean officials have threatened unspecified measures if the book is not revised .
these could include postponing the opening of the korean market to japanese cultural items .
president kim dae-jung has called for better relations the bbc 's seoul correspondent , caroline gluck , says the protests underline the lingering bitterness in korea over japan 's 35-year occupation of the country .
three years ago , the two countries pledged to improve bilateral ties and enhance forward-looking relations .
since then , south korea has gradually lifted decades-old bans on japanese cultural imports such as films and pop music .
the two countries were controversially named the co-hosts of the 2002 football world cup .
but in what is being seen as a sign of more trouble , hiroshima 's high court on thursday overturned the only compensation award ever made to world war ii sex slaves , prompting outrage in south korea .
presiding judge toshiaki kawanami said abducting the women to use them as forced labourers and sex slaves was not a serious constitutional violation .
a coalition of 22 south korean civic groups furiously condemned the hiroshima ruling .
