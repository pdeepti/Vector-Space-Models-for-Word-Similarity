that could start a domino effect on other struggling economies .
in the past six months many companies have gone bust and unemployment has risen to the highest levels in the country 's history .
in the last six months the recession has suddenly got much worse , and the country is now caught in a vicious downward spiral which no-one seems able to break at such times many argentines turn to a divine source for help .
every year on the outskirts of buenos aires , around the church of san cayetano , the streets fill up with long lines of tents , as 7 august , the saints ' day , approaches .
san cayetano is the patron saint of bread and work - the latter of which , in particular , is in short supply in argentina these days .
the tents are filled with pilgrims - most of them unemployed - who camp out through the coldest month of winter to seek the saint 's help in finding a job .
biggest gathering the festival is a sure barometer of the country 's economic situation .
and this year , according to all the pilgrims already camped out around the church , will be by far the biggest yet .
" i have never seen our country like it is now , " laments graciela acuna , as she prays to a little statue of the saint in the street outside her tent .
there are so many people without work .
graciela has been coming here for three years to thank san cayetano for performing a miracle .
what was the miracle , i ask her .
" he found me a job , " she says .
recession worsens three years - that is how long the recession has been going on in argentina .
but in the last six months it has suddenly got much worse , and the country is now caught in a vicious downward spiral which no-one seems able to break .
today the papers are filled with stories of murders , robberies and hostage takings when the robberies go wrong and the police are extremely jumpy many of those camped out have lost jobs only recently .
marcos says he , his father and his brother were all laid off two months ago when the construction company they worked for went bust .
he is now looking to san cayetano .
others want to leave the country .
a short radio report that the spanish province of galicia was offering work to those wishing to emigrate led to long lines of hopeful applicants , extending for several blocks , outside the galician tourist offices in downtown buenos aires .
sandra zoiro told me she has not been paid for four months .
she has two children and no money to pay the rent or school fees .
" it 's very hard to leave , " she said .
" this country is the cradle where we were born , which we love , but there 's no future for us here . "
corruption many argentines find it hard to understand what led this once prosperous country into such decline .
some point to decades of government overspending and corruption on a massive scale , particularly under the last president , carlos menem .
he is under house arrest now - accused of illegally selling arms to croatia and ecuador when both were under united nations arms embargoes .
today the government is $ 128bn dollars in debt and international investors are refusing to bail it out .
the government has repeatedly cut salaries and pensions - to daily strikes and protests across the country - but it still has not balanced its books and many ask why it is always the poor that have to pay in times of trouble .
crime growing the escalating crime rate is another sign of the times in a city that was , a few years back , one of the safest in latin america .
today the papers are filled with stories of murders , robberies and hostage takings when the robberies go wrong .
the police are extremely jumpy .
on the way back from the church at san cayetano we ran into a massive traffic jam .
the taxi driver had been listening to boleros - extremely sad songs about frustrated love and death almost all day .
when i asked him if the music did not make him feel a bit down , he said , " it 's better than the news . "
only with persuasion did he switch to a news radio station .
comedy of errors robbers , the announcer told us , are holding hostages in a building in the centre .
the whole area has been blocked off with police barricades and sharpshooters .
it was only the next day that the real story emerged .
the hostages turned out to be a group practising transcendental meditation who had locked themselves in as soon as the police turned up , thinking there must be a robbery going on .
when the police shouted through the door , asking whether they were being held hostage - the mediators said they were not , but refused to open the door because they thought the police were really robbers .
the police also did not believe the mediators because apparently , hostages are always told to say nothing is happening by their captors .
the standoff went on for hours before everyone realised the mistake .
waiting for a miracle of course , during hard times there are always some who doing very well .
a friend who runs a real estate business told me that there is a small group of extremely rich bankers and businessmen buying up lots of properties for cheap .
san cayetano , one of the pilgrims told me , was a rich italian nobleman who one day decided to give all his wealth to the poor .
perhaps , the pilgrim said hopefully , san cayetano will make the argentines who have money do the same .
that , i thought , really would be a miracle .

pakistan is now in its third year of drought - the worst ever seen here .
a large percentage of the population live in the affected areas .
while heavy rains in the north of the country killed more than 160 people last week , the arid province of baluchistan and other provinces are suffering from little or no rain .
we are beginning to wonder how are they going to manage to cope between now and next year jeff taft-dick , wfp pakistan livestock has died , fruit orchards have withered away and crops have failed .
the next rains are due at the end of the year and if they come the harvest will only follow some months later .
the farmers and small land-holders have nothing left to see them through the difficult times ahead .
' barely coping ' wages for labourers have plummeted , as have the price of animals in the market .
" people are just barely managing to cope this year after two or three consecutive years of drought and so i think that we are beginning to wonder how are they going to manage to cope between now and next year , " said jeff taft-dick , the head of the world food programme in pakistan .
" they 've used up their available reserves , their numbers of livestock have decreased , so i think it should be a great concern to all of us . "
international agencies have been providing food , grants , seed and water-pumps .
the world food programme plans to assist 350,000 people pinpointed in a recent survey of the most needy .
losses the torrential rain which caused devastation in northern pakistan last week did little to help the drought-affected areas .
mr taft-dick said the government worked hard to mitigate the effects of the drought , but that it was hard to focus attention on the continuing problem .
" i think ' out of sight , out of mind ' is a problem here now and especially at the federal level in islamabad .
" in pindi where now the crisis is flooding and too much water , it 's hard to conceptualise a situation where you have villages that are without water and people are coming to the end of the line in terms of being able to cope , " he said .
the drought has cost pakistan a huge amount in lost revenues .
aid agencies say the government needs to start planning its water strategy to face any future emergencies by building more reservoirs and stopping wastage .
but this will be too late for those who are facing destitution because of the current drought .

the farmers and small land-holders have nothing left to see them through the difficult times ahead .
' barely coping ' wages for labourers have plummeted , as have the price of animals in the market .
crops and livestock have died " people are just barely managing to cope this year after two or three consecutive years of drought and so i think that we are beginning to wonder how are they going to manage to cope between now and next year , " said jeff taft-dick , the head of the world food programme in pakistan .
" they 've used up their available reserves , their numbers of livestock have decreased , so i think it should be a great concern to all of us . "
international agencies have been providing food , grants , seed and water-pumps .
the world food programme plans to assist 350,000 people pinpointed in a recent survey of the most needy .
losses the torrential rain which caused devastation in northern pakistan last week did little to help the drought-affected areas .
mr taft-dick said the government worked hard to mitigate the effects of the drought , but that it was hard to focus attention on the continuing problem .
rains are not due till the end of the year " i think ' out of sight , out of mind ' is a problem here now and especially at the federal level in islamabad .
" in pindi where now the crisis is flooding and too much water , it 's hard to conceptualise a situation where you have villages that are without water and people are coming to the end of the line in terms of being able to cope , " he said .
the drought has cost pakistan a huge amount in lost revenues .
aid agencies say the government needs to start planning its water strategy to face any future emergencies by building more reservoirs and stopping wastage .
but this will be too late for those who are facing destitution because of the current drought .

plantation owners are now shutting up and moving out to avoid becoming easy targets for the rebels who belong to the state 's indigenous tribes and are fighting for a separate homeland .
fear haunts planters across tripura with armed militants openly roaming about pk sarkar , tea association of india the tea estates present rebels with an easy way of funding their campaign , through kidnapping and extortion .
in the latest wave of violence , three senior leaders of the governing communist party were shot dead by suspected rebels of the national liberation front of tripura -lrb- nlft -rrb- on saturday .
besides the nlft , the other major rebel group is the all tripura tiger force -lrb- attf -rrb- .
shut down last year , both groups are reported to have kidnapped about 600 people - including tea planters - and killed 40 of them .
" fear haunts planters across tripura with armed militants openly roaming about in the gardens , serving extortion notices , " pk sarkar , secretary general of the tripura unit of the tea association of india , told the afp news agency .
he said six tea estates had already shut down because of the growing pressure from the rebels .
" many more estates are on the verge of closure with the threat perception increasing day by day , " mr sarkar said .
many of the plantation owners are bengali settlers and are easy prey for the rebels who say they are fighting against the marginalisation of tripura 's indigenous population .
vulnerable angry plantation owners say they are provided with no security from the police .
" there is no security whatsoever and despite repeated requests , the local government has failed to provide protection , " mr sarkar said .
but police said they had not received any formal complaints although they had heard about extortion notices being served on planters .
" maybe the tea industry officials make their own arrangements to buy peace , " tripura police chief bl vohra said .
he added that many of the plantations were situated along the 850km-long border with bangladesh which added to the problem .
" gardens situated on the border are more vulnerable to militant attacks as the border is not fenced and there is -lsb- a -rsb- paucity of personnel to provide security to each plantation , " the police chief said .
