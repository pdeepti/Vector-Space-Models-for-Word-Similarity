" i suppose i need n't have done it but i could n't not do it . "
the concern i had was that it looked as though everybody thought it was all over , that there was a miracle cure and that we 'd done it john towers mg rover " after having become so involved from a personal and a business sense , there was n't a way to turn back from it . "
his decision made , john towers was left with the task of turning round a multi million pound loss making longbridge factory into profit .
english patient bmw had walked after failing to find a future for their " english patient " .
it left over 6 thousand workers with an uncertain future .
one of them was father of 4 , andrew cartwright , a paint shop worker at longbridge .
" it just hit me like a tonne of bricks , i thought , what am i going to do ?
i 'm going to struggle to get a job now " .
it had taken andrew three years to get a job at rover .
in 1989 it was seen as one of the most secure jobs in birmingham .
eleven years on , with a wife and four children it would have been vital , but very difficult , to get a job elsewhere .
saviour if rover had closed , the thousands of people who worked there and the tens of thousands who relied upon rover for their living , would have stopped paying taxes and gone on benefits .
that , in itself , would have had a significant national impact .
one year on , the remaining workers at mg rover now feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude to john towers - their " saviour " .

" but my goodness that was only the beginning . "
last chance john towers ' ruthless determination to make rover succeed led to one thousand people losing their jobs .
the company has now started recruiting again and for the first time in recent years , it is taking on apprentices .
but despite exceeding last year 's sales targets , the company 's future is largely dependent on the commercial success of the new mg .
something perhaps best summed up by andrew cartwright in the middle of his 10 hour shift in the paint shop .

but up until now , there have been few signs of this becoming a reality , with a host of wealthy benefactors seemingly happy to dip into limitless bank accounts to bail out their favourite team .
it is inevitable that more clubs will fall into receivership ... we are going to see many more qprs david poole director , singer & friedlander but this month , queens park rangers has taken the first step of declaring itself bankrupt by going into administration , and has even been desperate enough to suggest a merger with rival london club , wimbledon .
some analysts say this could be the first of many clubs to face bankruptcy and that this year could see the willingness of the uk 's football donors start to dry up .
but others are hoping that the success of clubs such as ipswich town - which sticks to budget and develops many players from scratch - will inspire more clubs to cut back the wage packets .
hopes for a saviour there is no denying that loftus road which owns queens park rangers is in a financial mess - its £ 11m debt mountain is escalating by about £ 570,000 a month .
in an industry such as football , corporate logic flies out of the window jeremy batstone natwest stockbrokers the club was quick to say that its hope was that a rich fan would emerge to solve its problems .
" my greatest wish would be for the right individual with ready funds , energy and ideas to step in and secure their future , " said ex-chairman and majority shareholder chris wright when the club went into administration in early april .
loftus road finances debts £ 11m losses in 2000 £ 4.735 players wages £ 8.4m turnover £ 8.05m although it may seem unlikely that anybody would like to give the club a large cash-injection , with virtually no prospect of returns , many football clubs have survived like this for years .
and a city-based consortium is reportedly preparing a £ 12m bid to maintain the club 's separate identity .
" in an industry such as football , corporate logic flies out of the window , " said jeremy batstone at natwest stockbrokers .
balance sheets unsurprisingly , it was the problem of wages that led to qpr 's troubles .
last year , loftus road spent £ 8.4m on player and management wages , more than its total revenue of £ 8.05m.
it then ran up losses of £ 4.735m.
qpr 's finances have got a red card the club continued to pay premiership salaries even when it got demoted , in the hope that this would help them on the road to a recovery and win a higher share of the television monies granted to leading clubs .
wimbledon meanwhile spent 110 % of its total turnover on the wages of its players .
with balance sheets like that , breaking even is a distant dream .
" it is inevitable that more clubs will fall into receivership ... we are going to see many more qprs , " said david poole of singer & friedlander which runs a fund , which invests in football clubs .
too many clubs ?
some clubs in the lower divisions have been hovering on the brink of bankruptcy for some time .
my greatest wish would be for the right individual with ready funds chris wright 48 % owner of qpr and some believe that there are just too many professional clubs - 92 to be precise - to be supported financially by benefactors and local businesses .
this would mean that the weaker clubs would wither and new talent would not come up through the league .
just seven out of the 20 premiership clubs reported a profit last season , although it is " the best league in the world in economic -lsb- turnover -rsb- terms " and on track to be the world 's first £ 1bn league , according to consultants deloitte & touche .
reckless investment ?
football clubs do not act like businesses : they splurge money on players in order to win even if this is beyond their means .
and a few bankruptcies might help to curb the demands of fans .
the wimbledon-qpr merger suggestion is certainly a commercial solution to the problem of profitability .
but the fans - the main source of income of any clubs - are outraged .
and the decision has been left with them .
few large scale mergers have gone through in the football world over the last years , with talks collapsing between sheffield united and sheffield wednesday , and the swindon , reading and oxford united trio .
falling shares clubs have tried other strategies such as launching financial services and listing on stock markets to raise money .
but , with the exception of manchester united , football shares have not performed well .
as an investment proposition , the answer has to be no jeremy batstone institutional investors have tended to stay clear , while the share holding base is held by proud fans wanting a share certificate to stick on the wall as a souvenir .
" as an investment proposition the answer has to be no .
if you 're a fan , buy a scarf instead , " said mr batstone and offering financial services and other branded products are unlikely ever to be able to offset the huge outlay on wages .
success stories but some clubs such as ipswich town have stuck to a better model , ensuring that players are brought up from the ranks rather than bought at cost .
both charlton and ipswich town are success stories of the premiership , showing that it is possible not to spend vast sums of money on foreign players and perform well on the pitch .
many clubs and fans are locked in the belief that key revenue from television coverage can only be achieved through spending huge amounts of money on the top players .
analysts hope that the example of these clubs may help soften the belief of rival clubs that huge wages - and a suffering bank balance - are essential to staying on top .

but early indications have shown other inland attractions are continuing to suffer from the fall out of foot-and-mouth restrictions .
powys accountant ian mitchell from the new rural business network said visitors to the brecon beacons this weekend were being told key rights of way in the countryside may not be open for weeks .
in north wales , four paths leading to the summit of mount snowdon which were closed by the foot-and-mouth crisis have been reopened in time for the holiday weekend .
early figures indicated that visitor figures - encouraged by good weather - may be up on last year 's may bank holiday .
a tourist information spokesman at betws-y-coed said the centre had opened early and staff had received numerous enquiries about which paths had re-opened .
park officials said its visitor park and ride scheme was working well , with people using the disinfectant mats provided .
snowdonia national park authority chief executive iwan huws marked the occasion on friday by walking to the top of the 1,085-metre peak - the highest in england and wales .
everyone involved should conduct themselves in a responsible fashion .
not doing so will jeopardise the re-opening programme and risk the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease .
snowdonia national park 's iwan huws the mountain was officially re-opened to walkers by the welsh assembly environment minister sue essex .
but , as the celebrations began in north wales , there was bad news in the south , with a second case of foot-and-mouth being confirmed in the county borough of newport .
the assembly reported that a case had been found in sheep at fairview , peterstone , wentloog , near newport - the second incident in the area in a week .
it took the total in wales to 84 .
the snowdon massif was closed to the public on 27 february because of foot-and-mouth restrictions and remained a designated infected area until 18 april .
the chief veterinary officer for wales has approved the reopening of the miners and pyg paths from pen-y-pass , the watkyn path through the national trust 's hafod-y-llan estate in nant gwynant , and the llanberis path .
snowdon national park authority wardens will give advice to walkers as they begin their ascent , and information leaflets will be handed out to visitors .
crisis in wales total confirmed cases uk-wide 1,522 - with 84 in wales powys - 50 cases anglesey - 13 cases monmouthshire - 16 cases caerphilly 1 rhondda cynon taff - 1 neath port talbot -1 newport - 2 walkers will also have to disinfect footwear at the start and end of their visit .
" the interest of walkers , farmers , tourism operators and indeed the whole local economy is at stake , so goodwill and co-operation is vital if the reopening is deemed to be a success , " mr huws said .
" signs have been erected on the summit of snowdon reminding walkers to also use the specified paths on their descent .
no dogs are allowed on the mountain and contact with sheep , cows , goats , pigs and deer is strictly prohibited .
" there is no doubt that reopening these paths will prove to be a much- welcomed boost to the local economy but it must be stressed that everyone involved should conduct themselves in a responsible and orderly fashion .
the powers that be say it is safe to walk these paths and now all we can do is hope they are right hill farmer dafydd morris " not doing so will jeopardise the reopening programme and risk the disastrous effects of the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease to the area .
but several farmers have voiced their disapproval of the re-opening .
hill farmer dafydd morris , who owns 1,200 acres in the llanberis area , said he would rather the mountain remained closed .
" as farmers we feel this is the lesser of two evils , " he said .
" we would rather people stayed away altogether until foot-and-mouth is totally eradicated .
parking banned " but it is better to open these four paths with restrictions than to open the whole mountain and say 'go where you like ' .
" the powers that be say it is safe to walk these paths and now all we can do is hope they are right . "
the snowdonia national park authority 's car parks at pen-y-pass and nant peris will remain closed to members of the public and grass verge and roadside parking remains prohibited under the terms of the risk assessment .
