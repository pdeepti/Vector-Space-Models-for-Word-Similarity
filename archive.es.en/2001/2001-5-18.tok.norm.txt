key points of bush plan promote new oil and gas drilling build new nuclear plants improve electricity grid and build new pipelines $ 10bn in tax breaks to promote energy efficiency and alternative fuels mr bush said his national energy plan would " light the way to a brighter future " for the us , and tackle a decade of neglect in the energy sector .
but the head of united nations forum on climate change , jan pronk , called the plan a " disastrous development " because it would fail to cut emission of greenhouse gases .
mr bush 's plan would encourage more oil exploration and greater use of coal and nuclear energy , while offering incentives for conservation and renewable energy sources .
with american households facing high petrol prices and california braced for rolling blackouts this summer , mr bush has made overhauling the nation 's energy policies a priority .
click here for a graph comparing international energy consumption " no matter how well we conserve , we 're still going to need more energy , " he said .
" if we fail to act , americans will face more and more widespread blackouts . "
his plan will boost domestic energy production and reduce reliance on imports .
" i ca n't think of anything better for national security than to replace barrels of oil that come into the country from nations that ca n't stand america - some of them do n't - with products that we grow here in america , " bush told a cheering crowd , as he unveiled his plan in iowa .
domestic criticism several prominent democrats were quick to attack the plan , indicating that the plan faces a tough battle in congress .
new electricity transmission lines will be built house democratic leader richard gephardt said : " we think the president 's plan makes the wrong choices for america and for the american people . "

california governor gray davis saw no relief for the energy crisis his state is facing , and accused the president of " turning a blind eye to the bleeding and haemorrhaging that is taking place in this state .
" we are literally in a war with energy companies who are price-gouging us .
many of those companies are in texas , " mr davis said .
" with all due respect , mr president , californians want to know whether you 're going to be on their side . "
specific measures the white house has earlier warned that the us faced the most serious energy shortage since the oil embargoes of the 1970s , with a fundamental imbalance between supply and demand .
president bush has been on a tour to promote his energy policies mr bush said the us could become more and more reliant on foreign crude oil , " putting our national energy security in the hand of foreign nations , some of whom do not share our interests " .
the plans include increased oil exploration in an arctic wildlife reserve , and an easing of regulations on oil refining , coal extraction and the building of new nuclear power plants .
the new energy policy includes plans to license 1,300 new power stations over the next 20 years , and to streamline the licensing of new nuclear plants to speed their development .
new electricity transmission lines will be build across the country , as well as more pipelines to carry oil and natural gas .
tax breaks totalling $ 10bn for fuel-efficient cars and energy efficient homes are also planned , in what is being seen as a change in attitude towards conservation measures .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- scandinavian telcos talks fail low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 18 may , 2001 , 06:35 gmt 07:35 uk scandinavian telcos talks fail analysts suggest a merger between teledanmark and telia would make more sense norwegian telecoms incumbent telenor 's efforts to merge with its danish rival have failed , telenor said in a statement to the stock market .
analysts were not surprised .
the former norwegian state telecoms monopoly 's talks with the us carrier sbc communications about acquiring its 42 % stake in teledanmark collapsed late last night .
following the talks ' collapse , the company insisted they were not merger talks , but simply discussions about an acquisition of shares .
" we have n't even spoken with teledanmark , " a spokesman told the norwegian newspaper dn .
media attention the merger attempt has attracted much attention in the norwegian media , while the danish press has shown much less interest .
the danish newspaper politiken quoted analysts saying that a merger between the two would have failed to create a scandinavian giant since neither has a large presence in sweden , the largest market in the region .
a more logical merger would be one with sweden 's telia , one analyst told the newspaper .
the proposed 18bn euros -lrb- $ 16bn , deal would have become the first ever merger between two former state owned telecoms firms .
the norwegian newspaper aftenposten reports that sbc has already been in talks with telia , as well as with deutsche telekom of germany about selling its stake .
so far , these talks have failed to progress .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- bt launches gprs phones low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's brian milligan " heavy users could find it cheaper " real 56k stewart newstead , bt cellnet 's wireless data service " we have tried to keep -lsb- our pricing -rsb- simple for all our customers . " real 28k friday , 18 may , 2001 , 07:20 gmt 08:20 uk bt launches gprs phones by bbc e-commerce reporter john moylan .
bt cellnet has launched a new breed of mobile phones in the uk : handsets that use general packet radio service -lrb- gprs -rrb- technology .
gprs will be revolutionary in that it will allow customers to experience fast and " always-on " access to the internet .
the new handsets are seen as a staging post between today 's digital mobile phones and the much hyped third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- networks due to be launched in a couple of years ' time .
if the telecoms companies are to be believed , gprs is about to change forever how we use our mobile phones .
the beauty of gprs in the telecoms world , talk is cheap .
so companies believe the path to higher revenues per subscriber is via handsets which allow us both to chat and access data on the move .
we have been here before .
wap phones launched last year promised internet access .
but users found the technology slow to use - an issue as mobile operators charged by the minute .
those with the patience to wait complained of the uninspiring wap content .
gprs is different .
the technology means you are always connected to the internet and there 's no more waiting around .
here to stay more importantly , you only get charged when you send or receive information .
that means two bills : one for talking and one for accessing data .
this is a new charging regime that we 'll all have to get used to in the years ahead .
for gprs is here to stay .
it 's on phones today , but soon the technology will be commonplace on a range of handheld devices .
it will mean salesmen on the move can be constantly aware of stock levels back at base .
market watchers could have instant access to share prices .
sports fans could keep across the day 's football scores - all this in a second , literally at the touch of a button .
bt 's launch " with gprs , the mobile internet has become faster , cheaper and more accessible , " said stuart newstead , bt cellnet 's general manager , wireless data .
there 's no question the new service beats wap hands down .
the lack of waiting time comes as a huge relief .
according to bt cellnet this is the key factor which changed how people used the product in trials .
they were happy to use it more often knowing a response would be instantaneous .
but the biggest drawback for many users initially will be the handset .
the first to go on sale is the motorola timeport .
at Â£ 200 it 's not cheap - do n't expect the mobile phone operators to subsidise these handsets .
more importantly the screen size is tiny , making any degree of browsing a challenge for all but the eagle eyed .
some will see this new development as just a starter to the ultimate main course : 3g .
but with so much speculation about the timescales and capability of that technology , gprs has two obvious advantages .
it 's here and it works .
orange and vodafone are also on the verge of launching gprs .
orange will kick off a commercial service at the end of the summer , while vodafone is set to make an announcement in the next few weeks .
