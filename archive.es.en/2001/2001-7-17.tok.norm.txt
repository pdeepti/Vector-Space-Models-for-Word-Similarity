peter hambleton , director of production at camr , which also carries out health related research , said it was important the laboratory continued to make the anthrax vaccine .
" the threat of biological warfare by rogue states has not gone away and certainly government will want to continue to protect troops that operate in such areas .
" there is also increasing concern that anthrax might become a weapon of bio-terrorism against civilian populations and the vaccine , like any other vaccines , does have a limited shelf-life , and therefore we should continue to manufacture and maintain stocks that can be used to protect civilians and troops .

stockpiling the anthrax vaccine will be made available under a voluntary scheme to troops by the ministry of defence .
it will be offered to those going to the gulf , and any other areas where there is a risk of anthrax being used as a biological weapon .

philips reported a 770m euro -lrb- $ 658m , £ 470m -rrb- second quarter loss , compared to a profit of 3.6bn euros in the same period last year .
defying its motto of ' let 's make things better ' , the dutch company 's results were much worse than analysts expectations .
for workers at philips there is more bad news .
the company expects to cut 4,500 to 5,500 jobs , or 3 % of its work force , in its semiconductor unit in the second half of the year .
this comes on top of about 7,000 jobs cut in the first half of 2001 reducing the total work force to 212,000 from 219,000 , the company said .
break-even possible but philips said it expects to break-even or record a small loss before special charges for the full year .
a slump in the semiconductor , telecom and personal computer sectors as well as a falling consumer demand in all markets across the globe were blamed by the company .
" we remain very cautious about the economic development for the rest of the year , as visibility remains low .
for semiconductors our current expectation is that the industry will not see a recovery before 2002 , " philips said in a statement .
by 1110 gmt , philips stock was four percent weaker at 28.02 euros recovering slightly from a session low of 27.53 euros .

the former head of peruvian intelligence is currently awaiting trial in lima on charges ranging from extortion to arms dealing after being arrested in venezuela last month .
however , a group of opposition members of parliament have said mr rangel and two other ministers knew mr montesinos was seeking refuge in venezuela .
this is the first time members of mr chavez 's cabinet have been accused of complicity in the case .
speculation is also likely to be fuelled that mr chavez himself knew that mr montesinos was in the country .
but mr rangel described the group of opposition members investigating the case , who are known as the truth committee , as " more like a committee of lies than a committee of truth " .
at a news conference , the committee said they had evidence that a lawyer acting for mr montesinos had requested political asylum for the fugitive from mr rangel , who was then the country 's foreign minister .
mr rangel refused , but said the government would not create any problems should mr montesinos be brought here , they allege .
the committee also implicated two other cabinet members and close allies of president chavez , adding to speculation of a cover-up .
an opinion poll suggests that as many as 60 % of venezuelans do not believe their government 's statement that the peruvian spy chief entered the country illegally and was protected by police linked to former presidents looking to discredit mr chavez .
the government will be hoping that an official investigation led by mr chavez 's supporters , which has so far admitted that high-level members of the country 's political police protected mr montesinos in return for money , will back the government 's line .

the former head of peruvian intelligence is currently awaiting trial in lima on charges ranging from extortion to arms dealing after being arrested in venezuela last month .
president chavez says he did not know montesinos was in the country however , a group of opposition members of parliament have said mr rangel and two other ministers knew mr montesinos was seeking refuge in venezuela .
this is the first time members of mr chavez 's cabinet have been accused of complicity in the case .
speculation is also likely to be fuelled that mr chavez himself knew that mr montesinos was in the country .
but mr rangel described the group of opposition members investigating the case , who are known as the truth committee , as " more like a committee of lies than a committee of truth " .
at a news conference , the committee said they had evidence that a lawyer acting for mr montesinos had requested political asylum for the fugitive from mr rangel , who was then the country 's foreign minister .
the former spy chief is awaiting trial in peru mr rangel refused , but said the government would not create any problems should mr montesinos be brought here , they allege .
the committee also implicated two other cabinet members and close allies of president chavez , adding to speculation of a cover-up .
an opinion poll suggests that as many as 60 % of venezuelans do not believe their government 's statement that the peruvian spy chief entered the country illegally and was protected by police linked to former presidents looking to discredit mr chavez .
the government will be hoping that an official investigation led by mr chavez 's supporters , which has so far admitted that high-level members of the country 's political police protected mr montesinos in return for money , will back the government 's line .

i 'd say it was the film i 'm happiest with so far . "
before disappearing into the west end cinema , driver was pressed by journalists for details about her forthcoming wedding to actor josh brolin .
driver said plans for the ceremony were progressing well but she was keeping tight-lipped about the event .
" actually it 's a big secret , i do n't want you to know , " she joked .
" but we 'll have a fantastic time . "
