the prison reform trust 's tables show the prison service in england and wales is failing in eight of its 18 " key performance indicators " .
the report indicates a high level of violence in prisons , with 6,388 recorded assaults in 2000-2001 .
a worrying number of prisons are overcrowded , unsafe and provide inadequate purposeful activity for prisoners joe levenson prison reform trust of these , just over half were on the 67,259 inmates in english and welsh jails .
worst was castington young offenders ' institution in morpeth , northumberland , where 93 % of inmates were assaulted last year - about 10 times the national average of 9.9 % .
other youth jails had high levels of assaults , with 62 % at brinsford in wolverhampton , 61 % at huntercombe in oxfordshire , and 54 % at ashfield in bristol .
the adult prison with the highest assault rate was wetherby , west yorkshire , at 52 % .
record population last year the prison service met seven of the 13 targets which were then in force .
report author joe levenson said : " the prisons league table shows that despite some progress the prison service is struggling to cope with a record prison population .
the prison service met its targets on overcrowding " a worrying number of prisons are overcrowded , unsafe and provide inadequate purposeful activity for prisoners .
" until these failing prisons are drastically improved , prisoners will continue to be held in damaging conditions with little to be done to prepare them for release . "
the prison service also failed to ensure that 1,020 inmates completed the sex offender treatment programme , the report shows .
just 786 achieved it , with the reason for failure being given as a lack of qualified staff .
however , the service did increase the number of prisoners completing reoffending programmes by 30 % , beating their target by nearly a fifth . £ 65m sick days staff sickness is still a huge problem , the tables suggest , with almost 597,000 working days being lost in the year .
assaults in jails 67,259 inmates 6,388 recorded assaults 9.9 % of inmates assaulted on average 93 % of inmates assaulted at castington yoi 52 % assaulted at wetherby prison this amounted to 13.6 days per worker and equated to a cost of more than £ 65m .
the tables , compiled from data in the prison service annual report , shows they met their targets on prison overcrowding .
however , the trust pointed out that officials did not consider two people being held in a single cell as overcrowding - which applies to 17.2 % of the prison population .
the prison service improved on its target of no more than 16 % of random drugs tests coming out positive , achieving a national average of 12 % .
but some jails failed dramatically to meet the mandatory drugs test target , including featherstone in wolverhampton .
this reported the highest drug use for the second year running at 34 % - followed by blakenhurst in worcestershire -lrb- 30 % -rrb- , leicester -lrb- 26 % -rrb- and cardiff and everthorpe in east yorkshire -lrb- both 25 % -rrb- .

" we are pleased that we met our kpi ensuring that no category a prisoner escaped from custody because protecting the public is one of our highest priorities . "
the high number of assaults in young offenders ' institutions was partly down to the fact they hold a " volatile cross section of the population " , he added .
" however , they do not tolerate violence in any form .
anti-bullying strategies are in force in all prisons and any young offender who is found to have attacked or threatened another will be dealt with by the governor . "

the mpc is due to announce its decision on thursday at noon in london , sufficent time to assess overnight manufacturing output data from the united states which suggests the slowdown there is intensifying .
recent uk rate changes , % may 2001 down 0.25 to 5.25 april down 0.25 to 5.5 february down 0.25 to 5.75 february 2000 up 0.25 to 6 source : bank of england in the uk during the past few weeks , the chorus of calls for a rate cut has reached a new pitch , with industry and trade unions warning of a dangerous economic slowdown .
but most closely-watched indicators still point to a relatively buoyant consumer market , sparking inflation fears that should sway the mpc towards leaving rates unchanged .
the bank of england 's key interest rate is currently 5.25 % , where it has remained since may .
happy shoppers for the mpc , the most persuasive indicator is evidence of continuing confidence and spending in the consumer market .
figures released on wednesday by the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- showed that retail sales surged in july .
uk shoppers are still confident the cbi said that 57 % of retailers reported year-on-year sales growth in july , compared with 13 % reporting lower sales - the widest gap between positive and negative sales for more than a year .
the figure tallies with the recent run of results from british retailers , which almost all showed healthy growth .
a consumer survey , published on tuesday by market research firm gfk , showed that british shoppers were only marginally less confident in july than in june , when confidence reached an 18-month high .
a series of property surveys , most recently one from the nationwide building society , have showed no sign of a slowdown in blistering house-price growth , despite warnings of a market reverse .
and uk annual inflation in june remained at its two-year high of 2.4 % .
unhappy workers but while these figures argue in favour of leaving rates unchanged , other recent numbers point towards an economic slowdown .
some say manufacturing is already in a recession uk gross domestic product grew by just 0.3 % in the second quarter of the year , its slowest rate in more than two years .
the gloom is most strongly felt in manufacturing , where firms and industry associations - including the cbi - have argued for weeks that a recession is looming .
the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- said on tuesday that more than 100,000 uk manufacturing jobs could be lost if the mpc refused again to cut rates .
the chartered institute of purchasing and supply said on wednesday that uk manufacturing output slipped for the fifth month in a row .
exporters also complain that their business is being hampered by the strong pound .
the item club , an influential economic think tank , recently argued that the bank of england should intervene to push the pound down - something that a rate cut would also help achieve .
two speeds the divergence between the two points of view is a symptom of the so-called " two-speed economy " .
few doubt that manufacturing is suffering , but consumer-driven sectors - which in recent decades have enjoyed far greater economic weight - are still performing strongly .
indications such as the second-quarter gdp figure show , some say , that the two speeds are starting to converge , and that the overall effect will be either a deceleration or even a recession .
gloomy growth figures from the united states and the eurozone in recent months have fuelled fears about the uk economy .

the shipment for reprocessing was held up when police removed five protesters who had chained themselves to the track at bischeim station on the french border .
several demonstrators scuffled with police on the platform but nobody was injured .
the convoy was delayed again near valognes when one protester attached himself to the track with a steel tube .
the train consisted of 12 containers carrying 21 spent nuclear fuel rods .
three containers were separated from the convoy at amiens and were put aboard a ship destined for the sellafield reprocessing plant in the uk .
the rods are from five plants across germany , including brunsbuettel in northern schleswig-holstein state and stade in lower saxony .
since germany restarted shipments earlier this year trains have faced serious delays caused by hundreds of protesters chaining themselves to the tracks along the route .
on tuesday , german police detained six protesters in karlsruhe and removed 17 others who had sat down on the line in hamburg .
the environmental group greenpeace said that " rarely has so much radioactivity been put on the rails " .
nuclear-free future germany stopped transporting spent fuel in 1998 when containers were found to have leaked radiation .
the decision to restart the shipments angered many environmentalists , particularly as the green party now forms part of the ruling coalition .
germany does not have the capacity to reprocess spent fuel itself , but the waste is returned to germany after processing abroad .
in june chancellor schroeder signed an agreement with the nuclear industry to decommission the country 's nuclear plants over the next 20 years .

the shipment for reprocessing was held up when police removed five protesters who had chained themselves to the track at bischeim station on the french border .
several demonstrators scuffled with police on the platform but nobody was injured .
the convoy was delayed again near valognes when one protester attached himself to the track with a steel tube .
the convoy was the largest to have crossed germany the train consisted of 12 containers carrying 21 spent nuclear fuel rods .
three containers were separated from the convoy at amiens and were put aboard a ship destined for the sellafield reprocessing plant in the uk .
the rods are from five plants across germany , including brunsbuettel in northern schleswig-holstein state and stade in lower saxony .
since germany restarted shipments earlier this year trains have faced serious delays caused by hundreds of protesters chaining themselves to the tracks along the route .
on tuesday , german police detained six protesters in karlsruhe and removed 17 others who had sat down on the line in hamburg .
the environmental group greenpeace said that " rarely has so much radioactivity been put on the rails " .
nuclear-free future germany stopped transporting spent fuel in 1998 when containers were found to have leaked radiation .
the decision to restart the shipments angered many environmentalists , particularly as the green party now forms part of the ruling coalition .
germany does not have the capacity to reprocess spent fuel itself , but the waste is returned to germany after processing abroad .
in june chancellor schroeder signed an agreement with the nuclear industry to decommission the country 's nuclear plants over the next 20 years .

a study by the prison reform trust has revealed that a quarter of all inmates in the jail take drugs .
prison drug use 25 % cardiff , south wales 25 % - everthorpe , east yorkshire 26 % - leicester 30 % - blakenhurst , worcestershire 34 % - featherstone , wolverhampton the nationwide inquiry found the prison service in england and wales was failing in eight of its 18 performance indicators .
only prisoners in wolverhampton , worcestershire and leicester were heavier drug users than at the cardiff jail .
the prison service has defended the findings .
a spokesman said they merely reflected the extent of drug use outside of cardiff prison .
visitors bringing drugs in to the building were cited as a constant problem and extra surveillance equipment is being set up in an effort to detect the smuggling .
a worrying number of prisons are overcrowded , unsafe and provide inadequate purposeful activity for prisoners joe levenson , report author the spokesman said cardiff was a local prison with many remand prisoners in its 500-strong population and frequent visitors .
usk prison , however , was at the opposite end of the league table .
findings showed just 2 % of positive drug tests - a sign of an older population .
a rise in the number of inmates in jails across the uk has been sited as a contributory factor to the drugs problem .
author of the report joe levenson said : " the prisons league table shows that despite some progress the prison service is struggling to cope with a record prison population .
' failing prisons ' " a worrying number of prisons are overcrowded , unsafe and provide inadequate purposeful activity for prisoners .
" until these failing prisons are drastically improved , prisoners will continue to be held in damaging conditions with little to be done to prepare them for release . "
the study revealed that featherstone prison in wolverhampton had the highest number of drug users for the second year running .
but other findings were more alarming .
