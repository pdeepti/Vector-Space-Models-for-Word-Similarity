a statement from the world health organisation said the 14-strong team of international and gabonese medics were " actively tracing suspected cases and contacts " .
they have set up an isolation unit in the town of mekambo and have launched an education programme for local village communities .
four villages have been put under quarantine .
but there is concern the deadly virus will spread , as health workers say they are unable to stop villagers travelling in and out of the area .
the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies said 50 red cross volunteers from gabon were also working to contain the outbreak .
this is the first known outbreak since 224 people died of it in uganda last year .
there is no known cure for ebola , a haemorrhagic fever , and between 50 % and 90 % of its victims bleed to death within days .
early diagnosis is difficult because victims suffer symptoms similar to flu .
dead monkeys the outbreak is in the remote north-eastern province of ogooue ivindo , where ebola killed 45 people in 1996-97 .
it is difficult to ask too much of villagers , many of whom are illiterate , and who traditionally help their sick and transport the bodies of the dead who doctor victor obiang the ebola alarm was raised after medical teams discovered an unusually large number of dead primates in the region .
the first human death was recorded on 2 december in ekata near the border with the democratic republic of congo .
the dr congo government has denied reports that the virus is also the source of an epidemic there .
a total of 28 people have died in this outbreak , although dr congo health officials say the fever is unlikely to be ebola , as had been earlier feared , but rather a similar haemorrhagic fever .
ebola was discovered in 1976 near the ebola river in the dr congo .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- chip prices boosted again categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 17 december , 2001 , 06:30 gmt chip prices boosted again the cycle could be turning back upwards for the second time in less than a month , korean chipmakers have boosted prices of memory chips , betting on an early rebound in the pc industry .
hynix , which is trying to restructure its way out of near-collapse by merging with micron technology , said it is putting up its contract prices by 10-20 % .
samsung electronics , meanwhile , is going for a 15 % increase .
the two firms - numbers two and one in the dynamic ram -lrb- dram -rrb- market respectively - both raised their prices on 5 december .
dark days the move does little to dispel the immediate gloom which still shrouds the semiconductor industry .
total sales are expected to finish the year 31 % down on the $ 200bn record in 2000 , a worse decline even than the 17 % recorded in 1985 .
and while the semiconductor industry association is hoping for a rise in 2002 sales of about 6 % many observers say a standstill is the best anyone can hope for .
dram chips have been particularly hard hit by the downturn of the past year .
the dram market exploded in the late 90s , but the more straitened circumstances of the past 12 months have exposed massive overproduction .
is the glut over ?
but whatever the future health of the industry , right now spot prices of drams are going up , allowing hynix and samsung to renegotiate their sales to pc makers .
the three months from december to february are usually the leanest time of the year for memory chip makers , as pc manufacturers wind down after the pre-holiday rush .
the ability to renegotiate at such a point in the cycle is a welcome surprise , the companies believe .
" even though it 's difficult to say the rise will be sustainable , it 's surely a good sign , " said hynix spokesman kim seung-soo .
reshaping the business aside from the price hikes , the other factor linking samsung to hynix is the persistence of rumours that it , rather than micron , will prove the white knight .
analysts , though , believe such a tie-up would have little to offer samsung .
hynix 's woes are partly the result of a government-sponsored takeover of lg semiconductor , the debt from which devastated its balance sheet .
more government intervention would probably be needed to get samsung to play ball , but officials are thought to have learnt from getting their fingers burnt with lg .

according to figures released by the national econoimc and social ddevelopment board -lrb- nsedb -rrb- , the thai economy barely grew at all in the third quarter of the year from july to september .
the nonexistent growth quarter-on-quarter meant that for the year to september , the economy expanded just 1.5 % , a figure which thai authorities expect to persist till the end of the year .
next year could be slightly better , nsedb secretary general sansern wongcha-um said - so long as recovery takes hold in the us , the destination for one fifth of thailand 's exports .
best case scenario mr wongcha-um refused to give predictions when he last presented growth figures shortly after 11 september .
but now he said that given faster than expected us recovery , he said , " our gdp growth -lrb- for 2002 -rrb- could reach the best case scenario of 2.7 % . "
the worst case , he said , was 1.3 % should the global economy remain in the doldrums till late 2002 .
the decline in the us and elsewhere has been at the root of thailand 's problems .
exports of goods and services were down 8 % on the same period last year , with tourism bearing the brunt of the slowdown .
overall , the nsedb said , exports are likely to contract 6.7 % for the full year , at the bottom end of the 6.1-6.7 % prediction it has previously made , while 2002 should see a modest 1.5 % rise .
nonetheless , there was some positive news to draw from the figures .
imports fell even faster than exports , and the 11.8 % drop left space for domestic production to expand and fill in the gap , the nsedb said . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jonathan head " it is an economy that is running at a very low level . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- japan ready to bail out banks categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 17 december , 2001 , 07:59 gmt japan ready to bail out banks the bad-loan charges are piling up at japan 's banks japan 's central bank stands ready to bail out the country 's ailing banks - but only in the event of a crisis .
the bank of japan 's governor , masaru hayami , drew comparisons to the situation of 3-4 years ago , when a meltdown in banking stocks - triggered by malpractice and bad debts - destroyed yamaichi securities .
bad loans / core bad loans at end sept 2001 -lrb- bn yen -rrb- mizuho : 5,580/3,060 yasuda trust : 547.05/329.12 sumitomo mitsui : 3,330/2,220 mizuho : 5,580/3,060 mitsubishi tokyo : 4,640/2,580 ufj group : 2,890/1,860 asahi : 1,290/810.4 daiwa : 898.79/439.09 sumitomo trust : 604.03/455.71 chuo mitsui : 925.8/413.5 nb : core bad loans are those where the debtor is bankrupt or at risk of bankruptcy that would not happen again , mr hayami said .
" in the event of an unforeseen situation , we are fully prepared to help , " he said .
" we now have a safety net in place to help firms in emergency situations , compared to 1997 , 1998 . "
no blank cheque but mr hayami made sure that no-one would take his words as giving banks a let-out clause from the bad debt mountain under which they are currently struggling .
at present japan 's government offers unlimited protection for bank deposits should a bank go under .
but in april a two-stage replacement for the scheme is scheduled to come into effect , removing the carte blanche .
some politicians - largely those in the ruling party who are on the banking lobby 's payroll - are calling for the scheme to be delayed .
mr hayami is having none of it .
" if we keep prolonging our plans , this may eventually undermine our creditworthiness , " he said .
" i think it should be carried out as planned . "
many observers believe that recovery for the banking sector , and for the sickly giant that is the rest of japan plc , can only come at the cost of companies going bust .
under water at least as far as the stock market is concerned , though , the banks remain deeply enmired .
banking stocks are at lows barely reached in two decades , in the wake of an earnings reporting season that saw the depths of the bad debt problem exposed .
the trouble is that while the gravity of the situation is becoming clearer , there is a lack of trust that banks will actually bite the bullet and come up with solutions .

the bank of japan 's governor , masaru hayami , drew comparisons to the situation of 3-4 years ago , when a meltdown in banking stocks - triggered by malpractice and bad debts - destroyed yamaichi securities .
bad loans / core bad loans at end sept 2001 -lrb- bn yen -rrb- mizuho : 5,580/3,060 yasuda trust : 547.05/329.12 sumitomo mitsui : 3,330/2,220 mizuho : 5,580/3,060 mitsubishi tokyo : 4,640/2,580 ufj group : 2,890/1,860 asahi : 1,290/810.4 daiwa : 898.79/439.09 sumitomo trust : 604.03/455.71 chuo mitsui : 925.8/413.5 nb : core bad loans are those where the debtor is bankrupt or at risk of bankruptcy that would not happen again , mr hayami said .
" in the event of an unforeseen situation , we are fully prepared to help , " he said .
" we now have a safety net in place to help firms in emergency situations , compared to 1997 , 1998 . "
no blank cheque but mr hayami made sure that no-one would take his words as giving banks a let-out clause from the bad debt mountain under which they are currently struggling .
at present japan 's government offers unlimited protection for bank deposits should a bank go under .
but in april a two-stage replacement for the scheme is scheduled to come into effect , removing the carte blanche .
some politicians - largely those in the ruling party who are on the banking lobby 's payroll - are calling for the scheme to be delayed .
mr hayami is having none of it .
" if we keep prolonging our plans , this may eventually undermine our creditworthiness , " he said .
" i think it should be carried out as planned . "
many observers believe that recovery for the banking sector , and for the sickly giant that is the rest of japan plc , can only come at the cost of companies going bust .
under water at least as far as the stock market is concerned , though , the banks remain deeply enmired .
banking stocks are at lows barely reached in two decades , in the wake of an earnings reporting season that saw the depths of the bad debt problem exposed .
the trouble is that while the gravity of the situation is becoming clearer , there is a lack of trust that banks will actually bite the bullet and come up with solutions .
the scepticism is reinforced by an increasing belief that central government 's words on the urgency of reform may not translate into actions .

a survey for the manufacturing science and finance union -lrb- msf -rrb- , which represents 1,500 clergy , showed that they were more vulnerable to assault than doctors or probation officers .
the rage culture of modern society is closing in on many clergy roger lyons , msf the increasing level of attacks has prompted the union to offer london clergy tae kwon do self defence classes - as used by the korean army .
msf general secretary roger lyons said the lessons were an offer of assistance .
" we feel many clergy are left completely open to violent people , " he told bbc radio 4 .
" they want to make themselves completely open , with full access to the public , but at the same time that can leave them exposed .
" with tae kwon do they can turn the aggression of the attacker on the attacker without being too violent themselves .
onward christian soldiers the report from the royal holloway college of london university showed that seven out of 10 members of the clergy had experienced some form of violence .
a similar number had been verbally abused by people ranging from beggars to members of their own congregations who had been denied a preferred wedding date .
every year at least one member of the clergy is killed at work .
the church of england has a responsibility to keep their employees safe at work .
but the unique role of the post can pose difficulties , said mr lyons .
the offer of voluntary tae kwon do lessons was agreed by the msf union 's clergy national committee .
the section 's head , the reverend bill ward said : " most clergy receive no training at all in dealing with violent people so we are making a start with our own self-defence classes .
" it is a sad fact of modern life that members of the clergy will come into contact with individuals who are likely to resort to violence . "
a union survey of 25 members of the clergy in south east england showed that one in five had been threatened with harm in the previous two years , often when they were in their own home .
almost half the threats were made by callers to the door seeking pastoral care or money , while some incidents took place in church grounds .
the msf is sponsoring a dignity at work bill which aims to give workers greater protection from bullying and harassment . watch / listen on this story roger lyons , general secretary , msf union " the rage culture across society is not excluding churches " see also : 28 oct 01 -pipe- uk vicars ' victims of physical abuse ' 04 sep 01 -pipe- wales clergy debate anti-crime strategy 21 aug 01 -pipe- uk ' church to desert deprived areas ' 15 may 01 -pipe- uk one-third of clergy ' in debt ' 14 nov 00 -pipe- uk who wants to be a vicar ? 06 mar 00 -pipe- uk women priests ' bullied and picked on ' internet links : church of england university of london msf union the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories now : postcode lottery in gp services leanne killer jailed for life tories attack brixton drugs scheme straw defends arms sales change ivf mix-up heads for court police shoot man on the m6 new challenge excites venables judge urges life sentence shake-up links to more uk stories are at the foot of the page .

kate barham is sainsbury 's christmas project manager 2001 and has spent the past year co-ordinating planning across the chain 's different departments .
she has certainly been busy - sainsbury 's laid on 1,000 extra products for shoppers this christmas .
sainsbury 's has introduced over 1,000 xmas products at sainsbury 's competitor , asda , two general managers have shouldered the burden of christmas logistics .
chris saunby , general manager for fresh food supply , and graeme douglas , general manager for groceries , beer , wine and spirits , together stock the shelves with food for over eight million customers .
' a logistical nightmare ' as a result of intricate planning , the volume of food going through the supermarkets at christmas almost doubles .
asda will ship 19 million cases of food this week this week alone asda will ship 19 million cases of fresh produce , compared with 10-11 million at other times in the year , says mr douglas .
" it is a logistical nightmare to deal with the volumes , " adds tarlok teji , a partner in the uk consumer business group at deloitte & touche .
" you have to have phased deliveries and be constantly building volume . "
phased deliveries alcohol and packeted products tend to hit the shelves first before the stores gear up for all the fresh produce .
my stress levels are starting to decrease , just as chris ' are starting to peak graeme douglas asda " my stress levels are starting to decrease , just as chris ' are starting to peak , " remarks mr douglas .
in the last 10 days before christmas , some of the major flagship supermarkets receive deliveries almost every hour to keep up with customer demand .
it is no wonder that the three months around christmas are known as the " golden quarter " .
supermarkets rake in a substantial amount of their annual profits during this period .
christmas autopsy you might think that the supply managers could take a breather after christmas , but in fact planning for the next year starts before the turkey even goes cold .
xmas puddings are planned in february ms barham 's replacement for next christmas started work a month ago , while asda is already planning to place its cracker orders for 2002 this week .
over the entire holiday period , the supermarkets are constantly analysing sales .
" we have an autopsy , " says asda 's mr saunby .
" we look at what 's happening during christmas .
we get store feedback and customer feedback before we place our orders for next year . "
by february , sainsbury 's is planning production time for its christmas puddings and last year took feedback from the women 's institute .
believe it or not - it also consulted with joke experts to improve the offerings in its crackers .
summer run-through the next burst of activity comes in the summer when the supermarkets enact a bizarre series of dress rehearsals .
sainsbury 's tested a store for xmas in august last august , ms barham oversaw the secret transformation of a sainsbury 's store in a dry-run for christmas .
" it is done overnight so that the customers were not annoyed by the snow flakes , " she says .
photos were taken and then shown to staff during training sessions so that they could get this year 's christmas look just right .
orders by september , the supermarkets start placing orders for christmas .
orders for some of the fresh food , such as sprouts , are constantly adjusted , even at the last minute , says mr saunby .
the biggest sellers are of course sprouts , turkey , wine , crackers and christmas puddings .
about 90 % of the turkeys and sprouts sold in a year are bought at christmas .
tesco , which has its own dedicated sprout manager , plans to sell 150 million sprouts in the week running up to christmas .
if these sprouts were lined up they would reach to brussels and back 11 times , according to the supermarket 's own research .
changing tastes over the years , stores have worked hard to mix the traditional products with innovations .
marks & spencer has traditionally been an innovator and played a key role in bringing luxury produce , such as stilton and preserves , to the mass market , says jacquie scull , a retail consultant at kpmg consulting .
as ms barham points out , christmas is about " lots of tradition with a slight twist " .
the slight twist saw an strong uplift in sales for goose and duck last year , according to the british retail consortium .
goose sales were likely influenced by a delia smith recipe - and it is a matter of priority for supermarkets to scan recipes of celebrity chefs to make sure that all the ingredients are readily available .
seven more days to go ...
with only a week to go until christmas eve , food shopping is shifting up a gear .
asda has over 1,000 trucks on the road delivering food - 40 % more than usual - as herds of customers begin to trample through the stores .
and ironically , for all their planning , ms barham , mr douglas and mr saunby will be leaving their food shopping until the last minute .
perhaps that is a measure of their confidence that this year the shelves will not run dry on christmas eve .

the member for ogmore , died on 7 december in his london home after a suspected asthma attack .
he was cremated at coychurch crematorium in bridgend , just a few miles from his constituency on the south wales coast .
tony blair led the tributes to sir ray sir ray 's death will lead to the second by-election of this parliament , although the date of the poll is yet to be announced .
both tony blair and welsh assembly first minister rhodri morgan have praised sir ray 's contribution to political life .
in a tribute , lord barry jones , former labour mp alyn and deeside , clwyd , said : " he had a heart , he cared and he showed that he did care .
" when necessary he was a warrior in politics .
he was quick , he was shrewd , he was resourceful and he was strong .
" he was proud , he was determined .
he was for the underdog , he loved his constituents .
" sir ray had the rhondda valley stamped down his spine . "
welsh whip renowned for his role as opposition whip between 1984 and 1995 , he sat on numerous commons committees - including the welsh affairs select committee - and was knighted in 1996 for his services to the house .
his strength of character was shown during 10 years as a labour whip , when he was in charge of organising which mps got the best offices in the cramped westminster corridors .
janice gregory am : ' devastated ' sir ray kept a young , feisty mp called ken livingstone - now mayor of london - waiting for an office for a year to keep him in his place .
he went on to play a key role in the development of westminster 's adjoining office block portcullis house , built to house mps in modern surroundings .
in the run-up to the 1997 general election , he claimed he had been offered a peerage in exchange for his seat if he agreed to stand down .
in the referendum on devolution during that same year , sir ray was one of a handful of rebel labour mps .
he claimed he was not against having a national assembly for wales - just the proportional voting system used to elect it .
at the last election , he held his ogmore seat with a majority of more than 14,000 .
his daughter is janice gregory , the assembly member for ogmore .

sir ray 's death will lead to the second by-election of this parliament , although the date of the poll is yet to be announced .
both tony blair and welsh assembly first minister rhodri morgan have praised sir ray 's contribution to political life .
in a tribute , lord barry jones , former labour mp alyn and deeside , clwyd , said : " he had a heart , he cared and he showed that he did care .
" when necessary he was a warrior in politics .
he was quick , he was shrewd , he was resourceful and he was strong .
" he was proud , he was determined .
he was for the underdog , he loved his constituents .
" sir ray had the rhondda valley stamped down his spine . "
welsh whip renowned for his role as opposition whip between 1984 and 1995 , he sat on numerous commons committees - including the welsh affairs select committee - and was knighted in 1996 for his services to the house .
his strength of character was shown during 10 years as a labour whip , when he was in charge of organising which mps got the best offices in the cramped westminster corridors .
sir ray kept a young , feisty mp called ken livingstone - now mayor of london - waiting for an office for a year to keep him in his place .
he went on to play a key role in the development of westminster 's adjoining office block portcullis house , built to house mps in modern surroundings .
in the run-up to the 1997 general election , he claimed he had been offered a peerage in exchange for his seat if he agreed to stand down .
in the referendum on devolution during that same year , sir ray was one of a handful of rebel labour mps .
he claimed he was not against having a national assembly for wales - just the proportional voting system used to elect it .
at the last election , he held his ogmore seat with a majority of more than 14,000 .
his daughter is janice gregory , the assembly member for ogmore .

bbc news online 's james arnold is on a tour of the eurozone to take the region 's temperature ahead of this momentous changeover .
his seventh report comes from the german town of krefeld .
" many of the smaller operators ... are having to sell out to bigger firms , or even close their doors entirely norbert monssen , german vending association in a country where , until recently , it was tricky to buy a packet of cigarettes after one o 'clock on a saturday afternoon , vending machines were always going to take off .
germany has an estimated 1.2 million vending machines , the second greatest number per head of population in the world , after japan .
as the euro approaches , switching over all those machines to handle the new coins has proved a money-spinner for a few firms .
but for the companies that own and sell their goods through vending machines , the euro changeover is an expensive headache .
coinco cashes in guenter kuhl is n't complaining .
he is general manager of the german subsidiary of coinco , a us-based firm which is a world leader in coin-handling technology .
handily similar to deutschmarks coinco arrived in the german market in 1999 , hot on the heels of its multinational clients - notably coca-cola .
and thanks to the euro , its sales growth has been astonishing - 2001 should see a 20-fold increase in revenues , mr kuhl says .
this year , coinco alone has rejigged 35,000 machines , compared with a normal total in the german market of 20,000 machines .
" it has been a wonderful year , but we are conscious that this is very much a one-off event , " says mr kuhl .
two currencies continue the vending-machine changeover is a little peculiar in germany .
machines in most eurozone countries are simply being switched over from one currency to the euro on a set date .
the ' global e ' system has been a top seller for mr kuhl but in germany , the similarity in size between certain deutschmark and euro coins - and the relative straightforwardness of the exchange rate , at almost exactly 2 deutschmarks : 1 euro - means that a more gradual changeover can be worked .
as in shops , german vending machines can be programmed to accept and pay out change in either currency for a while .
coinco 's ' global e ' vending machine system accumulates euro coins until it has at least 100 of each , after which it starts to shuffle deutschmarks into its cash box , instead of paying them out in change .
as a result , it is effectively making the changeover itself , instead of having to be reprogrammed by a technician .
operators bear the cost but not everything in the industry has run smoothly .
' global e ' and competing products do not come cheap .
according to norbert monssen , president of the german vending and catering association -lrb- bdv -rrb- , readying each vending machine for the euro will cost 1,000 deutschmarks -lrb- £ 317 ; $ 462 -rrb- - pretty much exactly the annual profit of an average machine .
despite heavy lobbying from the bdv and other groups , machine operators are being given no compensation for the cost of the switchover to the euro .
" many of the smaller operators - those with 20 or so machines - are having to sell out to bigger firms , or even close their doors entirely , " mr monssen says .
contracts rewritten all is not calm among the bigger operators , either .
although the euro-deutschmark exchange rate is very close to two , it is not exactly that - in fact , one euro is 1.95583 deutschmarks .
not all german vending machines are ready for the euro so a can of drink selling for two marks before the changeover will have to retail at one euro after - in order to minimise fiddly small change - a loss of almost 3 % to the seller .
the seller can not , of course , hike the price to 1.023 euros in order to preserve his profit margin , because vending machines can not cope with such prices .
for this reason , almost all contracts between operators and users of vending machines will have been rewritten over the past few months , as both sides jostle to shift the losses away from themselves .
another change looms after 1 january , one might expect the vending industry to lapse back into its habitual calm .
but these are stirring times for the business .
quite apart from the convulsions of the euro , a big change is underway for cigarette machines , which account for two-thirds of the vending machines on germany 's streets .
impending german child-protection legislation will make it an offence to allow the sale of cigarettes to minors - something that public vending machines effectively does .
this , says norbert monssen , is likely to spur vending machine operators to migrate over towards payment-card security technology , enabling purchasers to prove their age .
as cashless payment methods start to catch on , the switch to the euro could soon start to seem like a mere detail .

the president , who is seeking a fifth term in office , is facing a strong challenge from the capital 's mayor , marc ravalomanana , who is reported to have taken three-quarters of the votes cast in his home area .
however , correspondents say that president ratsiraka is likely to do better in rural areas and it will not be clear for several weeks who has won most votes nationally .
mr ravalomanana heads the country 's biggest food company , and is backed by the powerful madagascar council of christian churches .
his impressive showing in the capital makes it more likely there will be a second round of voting before an outright winner can be declared .
admiral ratsiraka has ruled virtually non-stop since 1975 with the exception of a three-year period in the early 1990s .
instability warning state radio reported a high turnout compared to the 1996 election , and the government said the electoral process was proceeding smoothly .
president ratsiraka is running for a fifth and final term admiral ratsiraka told reporters instability was inevitable if he was not re-elected .
any other candidate would be forced to dissolve the government or face a deadlock with his ruling arema party , he said .
and that , he added , would delay the fight against poverty .
but mr ravalomanana said his presidency would bring " access to development " for madagascar .
rags to riches in the 1970s and 80s , mr ratsiraka severed ties with the west as part of an attempt to bring socialism to madagascar .
after attempting to bring socialism to madagascar in the 1970s and 1980s , mr ratsiraka is now a staunch supporter of economic liberalism , and has made stability and continuity the watchwords for his current election campaign .
mr ravalomanana is a political newcomer for his part , marc ravalomanana has been capturing hearts with his lavish economic promises to rebuild the economy .
from a family of modest means , the 52-year-old is currently the owner of the largest non-foreign owned company in madagascar and , for many of his supporters , he is the epitome of the rags to riches story .
since becoming mayor in 1998 , he has earned himself a reputation as something of a maverick .
recent criticism surrounding mr ravalomanana 's non-payment of taxes has cast a shadow over his self-styled image of a by-the-book businessman who will bring economic progress to the island .
an ultra-strict protestant , many fear that if he is successful in sunday 's elections he will rule with an iron fist .
back-biting the last two weeks ' election campaigning has tended to focus on the personalities and the private lives of the individual candidates , often leading to a climate of political back-biting .
the four outsiders complain that didier ratsiraka and marc ravalomanana enjoy greater access to the capital and argue that campaigning has become a contest of gift-giving , devoid of political significance .
madagascar 's enormous size together with its weak infrastructure , especially its lack of decent roads , mean many of the ballot boxes will have to be transported long distances by foot before being counted .
consequently , the final result is only expected to be known in around a month 's time .

with 99 % of the votes counted , mr lagos ' " concert " coalition was on course to keep an eight-seat majority in the lower house , down from 20 seats before .
in times of international crisis , we chileans should remain more united than ever before president ricardo lagos in the senate , where only half the seats were up for renewal , the government 's one-seat majority was lost and control is now split 24-24 with the right wing opposition .
correspondents said the close results would make it difficult for the government to press ahead with plans to amend the constitution , put in place under former dictator augusto pinochet .
the results were also seen as a boost for the conservative mayor of santiago , joaquin lavin , whose democratic party led the opposition alliance for chile .
mr lavin , who lost to mr lagos by less than 1 % in the 2000 presidential elections , is now seen as the main contender for the 2005 vote .
in the lower house elections , the government 's coalition won 48 % of the votes , down from the 50 % it achieved four years ago .
the opposition increased its share of the vote from 30 % to 44 % .
its strongest gains were among candidates for the independent democratic union , a far-right party mainly made up of supporters of mr pinochet .
general pinochet , 86 , did not vote .
his spokesman said the former ruler was in bed with laryngitis .
the election was seen as the first major test for mr lagos 's 19-month-old government , which is battling an ailing economy and 9.7 % unemployment .
policies defended mr lagos ' opponents say unemployment grew mainly because of government support for workers ' rights that made firing employees more expensive .
the president blames chile 's economic troubles on an international crisis worsened by the 11 september attacks on the united states and a steep drop in the price of copper - chile 's main export .
mr lagos has said that chile 's economy will grow by about 3 % in 2001 and that the country is much better off than many others , especially in latin america .
