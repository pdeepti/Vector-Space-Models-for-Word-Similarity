the document , seen by the bbc , also indicated that sales of ladieswear slumped by about a quarter at the end of last year , despite a rescue package including price cuts .

the closures prompted protests in five french cities on friday .
the changes follow a wide-reaching review of the business by m & s 's new managing director , roger holmes , in an attempt to reverse the company 's declining popularity .
the plans include expanding product areas such as food and homewares , two areas where sales are increasing .
there will also be more in-store coffee shops .

restrictions put in place because of the disease will mean that some householders will not have their forms hand-delivered to the door .
census staff have been briefed on taking the necessary precautions where farmland is concerned , and have been told to leave forms at farm gates if necessary .
warning signs like these are now a familiar sight others may have to be posted and - in extreme cases - provision has been made to collect details by telephone .
there had been concern that the survey - carried out every 10 years to provide a statistical snapshot of the nation - might have to be postponed because of disease problems in rural areas .
officials have drawn up guidelines for staff in conjunction with the ministry of agriculture and farming unions and have said staff will exercise " maximum caution " in rural areas .
around 3,500 staff have been taken on in wales to complete the task of compiling the 10-yearly population record .
' tick box ' apology the new census has been dogged by controversy in wales .
there was outrage from many quarters when it was discovered that there would be no ' tick box ' for welsh people to indicate their nationality - even though provision had been made for the scottish and the irish .
graham jones , director of the 2001 census was forced to apologise for the upset caused .
in january , he made a special visit to cardiff to officially launch the " wales counts " campaign - aimed at persuading people not to ignore the census because of the ethnicity row .
' boycott ' call " i sincerely regret the upset and concern but unfortunately i do have to say that it is not possible to change the census form at this time , " he said .
he said a welsh tick box could be added for the 2011 census if a " strong enough voice " was raised .
but the independent wales party , which has been prominent in the campaign over the tick box issue , issued its own appeal , calling on people to boycott the census altogether .
the scottish parliament managed to get the nationality tick box included , but the census for wales is run from london .
' insult ' to wales although the welsh assembly protested when the tick box issue came to light , it had no power to change the forms .
campaigners described the absence of the tick box as an " insult " to wales , and a 10,000-name petition on the issue was sent to tony blair .
but the office of national statistics and the westminster government refused to change the forms , saying it would cost too much .
instead , they launched a publicity campaign to tell people they could tick the box marked " other " and write in the word " welsh " .
busier lives the majority of forms will be delivered by hand across the uk from 9 april in time for census day on 29 april , when forms have to be returned by post .
the last national census was carried out in 1991 .
since then lifestyles have changed and people have busier lives , the census organisers said .
there have been changes in working hours , the proportion of ethnic minorities has increased , and people are living longer , said officials .
a question on religion will be included for the first time , and there will be a census helpline in 12 different languages to help people fill in the form .
the main results of the census will be published in summer 2003 and will be made available on the internet .

" so there is a big question as to how it has spread here and why it has broken out in the industrial valleys . "
mr davies said it was worrying that the farm was only a few miles away from common land linking to many other parts of the valleys - the darren and rhymney valleys on one side , the aber and taff valleys on another , and , northwards , the merthyr valley and the brecon beacons .

the vehicle left a trail of blood , signs of which could still be seen at a layby on the a40 near llandovery , despite efforts to clean it .
safeguards it is the second time within days that a carcass-carrying lorry has been reported leaking .
after the first incident last thursday , council chiefs in carmarthenshire - the county whose border is close to epynt - demanded assurances that everything possible would be done to keep the county free from disease .
but on sunday , meryl gravell , leader of carmarthenshire county council , demanded an inquiry into how the epynt disposal operation was being controlled .
she said she was " shocked " at the news of the latest incident , and wanted an official inquiry .
it showed " a complete breach of assurances " that carcasses from infected areas would not be taken into carmarthenshire .
in north wales , maff officials are in the final stages of culling 40,000 animals on anglesey .
no animals have been slaughtered over the weekend , but the operation is expected to continue on monday .
