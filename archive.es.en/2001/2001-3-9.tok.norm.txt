and analysts predict the currency could fall even further .
michael workman , a currency strategist with commonwealth bank , said the australian dollar 's fortunes resembled " road kill " .
economists say the australian dollar has been hit by a " triple whammy " of falling gross domestic product , a cut in interest rates and economic weakness in the country 's main export markets .
on friday , one australian dollar bought just over us $ 0.50 , and some traders predict the us $ 0.48 mark could be reached soon .
the stock market remained firm despite the weak dollar , with the all ordinaries index closing down just 0.38 % at 3,276.9 .
government under fire as australia 's economic problems begin to pinch , prime minister john howard 's government has been under increasing fire .
critics accuse mr howard of having , in effect , engineered a recession , a charge he has denied .
in an interview with an australian commercial radio station , mr howard did his best to put a positive spin on the situation .
" can i say the weaker dollar has the silver lining that in relation to commodity prices and commodity exports it does boost them quite a lot , " he said .
however , an economic crisis in japan , caused by a comment by its finance minister kiichi miyazawa that the debt burden is pushing the government 's finances close to collapse , is expected to hurt the australian economy , a possibility that mr howard acknowledged .
recent rate cut the reserve bank of australia earlier this week took the unusual measure of cutting interest rates for the second time within a month .
the rate cut was seen as an attempt to halt a slide into recession .
interest rates were cut to 5.5 % , down from 6 % a month earlier .
the decision came after key economic data revealed that the economy was in negative growth for the first time in a decade .
politicians and economists ' fears that australia is heading for a recession - technically defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - were strong then , and they have hardly been lessened by the problems in japan .
recession fears were fuelled when , shortly after the second interest rate cut , the government revealed that the nation 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- - the broadest economic indicator - was 0.6 % lower in the final three months of the year compared to the previous quarter .
