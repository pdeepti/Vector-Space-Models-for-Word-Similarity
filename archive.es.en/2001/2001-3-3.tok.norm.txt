a few years ago it would have been unthinkable for cbs , one of america 's long established networks , to broadcast a gay comedy in prime time .
but when some of my best friends went on the air this past wednesday it stirred hardly a whiff of complaint or controversy .
part of the reason why the response was so muted is because gay characters and gay-themed storylines have now become almost routine on us tv .
but gay media groups have been quick to comment on the significance of cbs 's decision to air some of my best friends .
danny nucci -lrb- frankie -rrb- and jason bateman -lrb- warren -rrb- cathy renna from the gay & lesbian alliance against defamation -lrb- glaad -rrb- in new york , said : " the reason that this show is groundbreaking is because it 's the first programme on the cbs network to have a gay lead character .
" cbs is by far the most conservative network and has really fallen behind in terms of the number of gay representations they have .
so for us this is a statement by this network to be more inclusive . "
some of my best friends is set in new york 's greenwich village and it revolves around three men - warren , a gay yuppie , frankie his heterosexual italian-american roommate and vern his over the top gay neighbour .
it is hardly highbrow tv .
the show is packed with stereotypes but the actors are good , which has led some critics to soften their disdain for the hackneyed storylines .
the series is just the latest addition to the so-called " gay revolution " that has swept through american tv in the past few years .
there are now more than a dozen gay characters in top rated us programmes .
er boasts a lesbian relationship .
also , this past year has witnessed the much publicised arrival of a us version of the british tv series queer as folk on a major pay tv cable network .
' open-minded ' actor danny nucci , who plays the macho italian-american frankie in some of my best friends , thinks the series has arrived on network tv because of changing attitudes .
nucci says : " i would like to hope it 's a result of the audience being a little more open-minded . "
but the truth is that cbs probably put this gay sitcom on the air because it is trying to duplicate the success of will & grace , an award-winning prime time gay comedy broadcast by nbc , a competing network .
gay teenager justin taylor , played by randy harrison , from the us queer as folk will & grace , which won an emmy for best comedy , also features a gay leading man .
it chronicles his close relationship with his neighbour who happens to be a heterosexual woman , and his effervescent gay roommate .
alec mapa , who plays the flamboyant vern in some of my best friends acknowledges that every gay series that gets on the air owes a debt to its predecessor .
" i do n't think you could have had will & grace without the success of ellen , and i do n't think this show could have been produced and developed without the success of will & grace , " he said .
some critics have found the stereotyping in some of my best friends offensive .
vern is very much the flamboyant prissy gay man , who has been subjugated to the role of sidekick to generate many of the laughs .
breakthrough although he is well portrayed by alec mapa there is no getting away from the fact that audiences are laughing at him simply because he is gay .
and nearly all the humour in the first episode revolved around heterosexual discomfort with gay people .
cathy renna at glaad hopes this cbs series will evolve .
" i think they need to very quickly develop the gay and lesbian characters so they 're full characterisations , so they do have a life outside their sexual orientation , " she said .
despite the complaints , the presence of some of my best friends on network tv is being hailed as a major breakthrough by many gays .
american tv is now ahead of the rest of the country in its attitude towards gay people .
it has taken on the role of advocate , it is breaking down resistance and placing gays more in the mainstream .
imperfect as it is , some of my best friends is seen by many gays as just the latest addition to a crusading tv culture that is helping to advance their rights by making them more visible and less threatening .

scottish power engineers have been working round the clock to restore supplies after scores of pylons were brought down in the storms .
they hope to have restored power to most homes by saturday night , but some residents may face another night without electricity .
a spokesman said many access roads are blocked with up to 15ft of snow , hampering efforts to re-connect supplies .
" the main problem in reaching people has been packed snow .
" we have over 1,000 line workers and support staff working in the area and we are working closely with the emergency services and the local council . "
he said the company , along with local authorities and the emergency services , was moving generators into hotels and community centres so people without power had somewhere to gather .
deep snow has blocked many roads helicopters have been dropping supplies of fuel , bread and milk in areas which have been cut off by drifting snow , while territorial army soldiers have been on standby to help out .
the spokesman said : " we hope to have most of them back on by this evening but unfortunately not all of them will be .
" we are having real difficulty with access because of the snow , there is still drifting .
the company also plans to hand out " goodwill payments " to anyone whose power has been off for more than 18 hours , the spokesman added .
responsibility question but michael moore , liberal democrat mp for tweeddale , ettrick and lauderdale , said it was clear there was no coherent co-ordination to deal with the situation .
he said many of his constituents had not only lost electricity , but the phone and water supplies as well .
mr moore said : " we are going to have to a very long , hard look at this and what has been clear over the last few days is that nobody in particular has had overall responsibility .
" somebody in the scottish executive has got to be put in charge of making sure we have disaster recovery plans . "
people in isolated areas have been stuck in their homes temperatures only reached a maximum of 3c on friday , meaning little of the snow has melted .
all schools in the borders remained closed on friday as they were either inaccessible or had not had footpaths or playgrounds cleared .
scottish borders council says it hopes to open all schools again on monday .
elsewhere in scotland , temperatures dropped to minus 18c in the central highlands , minus 8c in edinburgh and minus 6c in glasgow .
fresh snow forecasters say it will remain bitterly cold over the weekend and further falls of snow have been predicted .
the weather is causing ongoing travel problems , with the main a697 carfraemill to coldstream road remains blocked in three places .
fresh snow falls have been making things difficult around stranraer and parts of the north-east .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- bae accused of ' demanding ' contract low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo vosper thornycroft 's md martin jay " i hope ministers reject their outrageous demands " real 28k bae systems marine md simon kirby " we are not looking at a monopoly " real 28k saturday , 3 march , 2001 , 06:55 gmt bae accused of ' demanding ' contract bae marine systems wants the contract for 12 destroyers the country 's biggest military shipbuilder has threatened to close shipyards unless the government gives it the entire contract for 12 destroyers .
bae systems marine employs 8,000 workers in shipyards at govan and scotstoun on the clyde and the barrow yard in cumbria .
the company says getting all the Â£ 6bn contract for the type 45 destroyers is the only viable means by which it can afford to build them .
its managing director simon kirby said it might otherwise have to " review its position " in the industry , but other shipbuilders have accused the company of making " outrageous demands . "
bae systems marine new demands come as its parent company , bae , announced a 61 % reduction in pre-tax profits from Â£ 459m to Â£ 179m after a Â£ 300m overrun on the cost of the nimrod airborne reconnaissance programme .
defence secretary geoff hoon has said bae systems will not have a monopoly bae systems marine is scheduled to build the first three destroyers with the southampton based shipbuilders vosper thornycroft , but it has submitted an alternative bid which would see vosper cut out of the deal .
bae systems marine managing director simon kirby told bbc radio 5 live that it does not want to proceed with vosper because the two companies jointly can not get an affordable price .
he denied that the company was effectively looking for a monopoly from the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- to build all 12 ships .
he said : " we need to have the order for 12 to have an affordable solution and to make an acceptable shareholder return .
" any business that can not make an acceptable shareholder return will need to review its position in that market sector .
" we are not looking at a monopoly .
we are looking at a particular problem in the uk warship industry .
we need to rationalise the capacity and restructure . "
mr kirby said other shipbuilders would be involved as sub-contactors building parts of the destroyers .
' working extremely well ' the managing director of vosper thornycroft , martin jay , said it was " totally wrong " to suggest that vosper and bae marine systems were not able to work together .
" we are working extremely well together on the initial design side .
i 'm sure we will work together on the remaining collaboration to build the first three warships .
i hope ministers reject their outrageous demands and tell bae ' nice try but get on with competing like every uk shipbuilder is required to do ' vosper thornycroft managing director martin jay " what bae wants is for the government to make them a special case because they can not make an adequate return for them to compete unless they have a monopoly .
" i hope ministers reject their outrageous demands and tell bae ' nice try but get on with competing like every uk shipbuilder is required to do " ' .
vosper say 3,000 jobs at their woolston shipyard could go if they fail to secure the destroyer deal .
last month defence secretary geoff hoon told local mp syd rapson that , while the government will consider bae 's new bid , the mod does not intend to give the company a monopoly .
he also said that vosper will have a major part of the contract .
