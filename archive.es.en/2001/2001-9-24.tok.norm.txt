mr blair has invited members of four select committees - defence , the intelligence services , home and foreign affairs - to downing street for the monday meeting .
he will tell them about the results of his tours to europe and the us last week , as well as the latest diplomatic moves undertaken by his government .
downing street says his main aim is to ensure that the international coalition being built abroad is matched by a cross-party consensus at home .
the meeting comes amid calls from backbenchers of all parties for parliament to be recalled to debate britain 's contribution to the coalition battling terrorism .
straw to visit iran on sunday mr blair continued his shuttle diplomacy , speaking on the phone to un secretary-general kofi annan and canadian prime minister jean chretien .
he is planning further conversations with his foreign counterparts this week , including one with indian prime minister atal behari vajpayee on monday .
foreign secretary jack straw is setting off on a tour of the middle east , including iran , on monday , to do his bit in the attempts to build a global coalition .
ahead of his visit , mr straw praised the " human understanding which iran showed " following the us attacks , and predicted a " new era " in relations with the islamic state .
home secretary david blunkett is looking at ways to counter terrorism within the uk .
on sunday he said he was seriously considering introducing compulsory identity cards , as well as various new pieces of anti-terrorist legislation .
these are understood to include pan-european arrest warrants , new powers for police to arrest terrorist suspects for interrogation , and the allowance of transcripts of phone calls bugged by mi5 as evidence in court .
growing dissent however , there are signs of growing unease among the labour backbenches over british involvement in the us response to the attacks .
mohammed sarwar , the muslim labour mp for glasgow govan , warned that america was seeking to be " accuser , investigator , prosecutor and at the same time judge and jury " in the case .
and former defence minister peter kilfoyle warned of american " hawks " using the crisis to " settle old scores " with countries like iraq .

" we expect that there will be strong rate increases in the reinsurance market that will put us in the position to earn back these losses in the next few years , " chief executive wilhelm zeller said in an interview with euro am sonntag .
" that 's why we maintain that the year 2002 will be a good one as long as there are no longer any similar extraordinary events , " he told the newspaper .
the warning that much of the cost of the terrorist attacks on america will be passed on to the reinsurance industry 's customers , namely insurance companies , came after a 46 % fall in hannover 's share price to 42.80 euros -lrb- $ 39.80 , £ 26.90 -rrb- .
previous warning insurance premiums were already widely seen as likely to rise as a result of the attacks , with additional costs for terrorist specific policies .
already , higher insurance costs have hammered activity in the airline and shipping sector .
on friday , munich re , the world 's number one reinsurer , said it would undertake a " fundamental reassessment of the risk situation " when reinsurance policies come up for renewal in the last quarter of the year , " as the attacks have revealed a previously unimaginable risk potential " .
" primary insurance and reinsurance coverage , as well as terms and conditions will have to be completely rethought , " the group said .
cheap shares ?
hannover re estimates that it will face claims of about 400 million euros -lrb- $ 366m , £ 251m -rrb- following the attacks .
the claims are expected to wipe out its 2001pre-tax profits .

zeller predicts a sharp rise in reinsurance premiums " we expect that there will be strong rate increases in the reinsurance market that will put us in the position to earn back these losses in the next few years , " chief executive wilhelm zeller said in an interview with euro am sonntag .
" that 's why we maintain that the year 2002 will be a good one as long as there are no longer any similar extraordinary events , " he told the newspaper .
the warning that much of the cost of the terrorist attacks on america will be passed on to the reinsurance industry 's customers , namely insurance companies , came after a 46 % fall in hannover 's share price to 42.80 euros -lrb- $ 39.80 , £ 26.90 -rrb- .
previous warning insurance premiums were already widely seen as likely to rise as a result of the attacks , with additional costs for terrorist specific policies .
already , higher insurance costs have hammered activity in the airline and shipping sector .
on friday , munich re , the world 's number one reinsurer , said it would undertake a " fundamental reassessment of the risk situation " when reinsurance policies come up for renewal in the last quarter of the year , " as the attacks have revealed a previously unimaginable risk potential " .
" primary insurance and reinsurance coverage , as well as terms and conditions will have to be completely rethought , " the group said .
cheap shares ?
hannover re estimates that it will face claims of about 400 million euros -lrb- $ 366m , £ 251m -rrb- following the attacks .
the claims are expected to wipe out its 2001pre-tax profits .
rising premiums should push up earnings and eventually the share prices should reflect this , said mr zeller , insisting that he believes it will soon rise to 80 euros .
" i have twice purchased additional shares for my private portfolio because you will never get these shares so cheap , " mr zeller told the newspaper .

last week 's dramatic falls on the ftse 100 index are believed to have been triggered , in part , by heavy selling of stocks by life insurers .
under fsa rules , life insurers are forced to sell their riskiest assets , in this case their massive share holdings in blue chip companies , to ensure they can cover all their liabilities .
the new rules will allow the companies to make " their own judgement as to the most appropriate investment strategy ... for their own particular circumstances " , the fsa said .
london 's leading share index , the ftse 100 , fell about 7 % during the past week .
rules already eased the rules have forced insurers to dump billions of pounds worth of shares in the past two weeks , according to the sunday business newspaper , quoting an fsa spokesman .
a report in the sunday telegraph , sourced to unidentified fund managers and brokers , said muenchener rueckversicherungs-gesellschaft ag and swiss reinsurance co had begun selling mainly blue-chip ftse 100 listed shares .
the fsa has already eased rules for insurers since the us crisis began , in an effort to shore up the markets .
it temporarily amended the so-called " resilience test " , which life insurers use to check that their funds can withstand falls of 25 % or more in share markets .
an fsa spokesman told sunday business : " we are actively considering further relaxation of the resilience tests . "
investigations continue in a separate development , the fsa has asked uk financial institutions to check their records to see if they have done any business with people suspected of being linked to the terror attacks on the us .
on its website , the regulator has posted a list of alleged suspects , which it says are under investigation by the fbi .
the move comes as regulators around the world continue to look for signs that the organisers of the attacks may have profited from it by selling shares beforehand .

but trade is likely to remain jittery until the outcome of the military build-up in central asia and the middle east becomes apparent .

market nerves will not have been calmed by a report from investment bank merrill lynch , which said it expects the us economy to fall into recession in the second half of the year .
the bank says us interest rates could end the year as low as 2 % from the 3 % they now stand at .

a pro-democracy party has made unexpected gains in elections in the chinese territory of macau , the first since portugal handed the former colony back to china in 1999 .
the new democratic macau association polled over 20 % of the votes and took two seats out of the 10 being contested .
four were won by pro-beijing candidates and four by pro-business candidates .
macau 's chief executive , edmund ho monday , said the results showed that china 's " one country , two systems " model was being effectively implemented .
the other 17 members of the legislative assembly are chosen by special interest groups or appointed by the chief executive .
the association 's leader , antonio ng kuok-cheong , said he was surprised at his party 's success .
" before now , we were worried that we would n't even get one seat , " he said .
turnout down the association attracted 16,960 votes , or 20.95 % of the total .
in 1996 , it won only 6,332 votes or 8.44 % of the total ballot , and just one seat .
however , turnout was sharply down from 64 % five years ago to 52 % .
macau 's economy is dominated by gambling and tourism , making it a popular weekend retreat for residents from hong kong , many of them avid gamblers .
macau was handed back to china in december 1999 , ending 442 years of direct rule from lisbon .
like hong kong , the former portuguese enclave enjoys a high degree of autonomy under a " one country , two systems " arrangement .

some areas will now be classed as " at risk " from foot-and-mouth instead of at " high risk . "
last week , welsh rural affairs minister carwyn jones led a delegation to defra headquarters in london to say it was unfair that areas free of the disease were still subject to movement restrictions .
crisis in wales total confirmed cases uk-wide 2,013 - with 118 in wales powys - 78 cases anglesey - 13 cases monmouthshire - 21 cases caerphilly - 2 rhondda cynon taff - 1 neath port talbot -1 newport - 3 the decision to split the county up means some farmers can enjoy more freedom in moving cattle and pigs from monday .
but farming leaders have maintained demands for compensation to those still unable to move animals .
brecon has carried the brunt of powys 's 78 cases - a geographical quirk which meant farmers in other areas were hamstrung by defra restrictions .
the county has itself seen by far the most number of disease outbreaks in wales , with the virus making a comeback in august before further testing programmes began to control the spread .
' first step ' brecon and radnor mp roger williams said : " the case the powys delegation put forward for changes to the new rules was very strong .
" however , this must only be the first step in getting the rest of radnorshire and north breconshire downgraded .
" there is no justification for maintaining the high risk designation for these areas , which have not seen a case of foot-and-mouth disease for many months . "
he maintained it was essential that farmers left in the " high risk " areas , who have had to send their stock to a welfare cull , get increased payments .
restrictions will remain on all farmers wanting to move sheep out of the area until the results of sheep serology testing are known .
but those testing procedures are being speeded up and carwyn jones said he was hopeful north powys could achieve full , disease-free status within a month if results are negative .
' massive restrictions ' hugh richards of the national farmers union in wales said : " the new measures do not go as far as we had hoped .
" sheep farmers will still be massively restricted by the controls .
the priority is to eradicate the disease but we can not allow farmers to be driven out of business in the process .
" with normal trading unable to take place , fair compensation rates must be available . "
meanwhile , the prince of wales is due to meet farmers who helped during the foot-and-mouth crisis while on a visit to the territorial army in pembrokeshire .
