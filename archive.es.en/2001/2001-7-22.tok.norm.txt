the cancer is usually treated by an operation to remove the cervix and the womb , leaving the woman unable to have children .
but two london hospitals are offering less radical surgery which has had success in treating the disease without destroying the essential parts of the reproductive system .
specialists at st bartholomew 's hospital and the royal marsden hospital have published a report of the new treatment on a group of women and their lives after surgery .
surgeons removed just the cervix and a smaller amount of tissue from the patients , leaving the womb intact .
low recurrence the report showed that a number of patients went on to conceive naturally and have children delivered by caesarean section .
the recurrence of cancer was also reported to be low , with only one case out of 50 women who have had the operation so far .
john shepherd , a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at st bartholomew 's , told the sunday telegraph the success of britain 's cervical cancer screening programme meant that the disease was being caught in its early stage in many more patients .
he said it was time to consider whether they all needed drastic treatment that would leave them infertile .
" the traditional treatment for cervical cancer is a radical hysterectomy or radical radiotherapy but that of course takes away all the hope of having a baby and a family , " he said .
" what we are trying to do is to conserve that . "
doctors believe the technique could help a carefully selected group of women in the early stages of cancer , where the disease is small and unlikely to have spread .
the report is to be published in next month 's british journal of obstetrics and gynaecology .

but what is the g8 summit , and why has it become a target of protest ?
what are the g7 and g8 ?
the g7 , or group of seven , is made up of the world 's seven richest industrial countries - the united states , japan , germany , france , britain , italy , and canada - whose leaders have been meeting regularly since 1975 in an annual summit to discuss problems in the world economy .
the summits began when the world was facing an oil crisis which had pushed the world into recession , and this year there will again be talk of how to coordinate a response to the global economic slowdown .
however , the annual summit has evolved over the years to include other topics such as the environment , money laundering , and global health issues .
in 1991 , russia was informally admitted to take part in the non-economic discussions , and in 1994 this was made permanent , turning the g7 summit into the g8 summit .
the leaders who met this year include president george w bush of the united states , uk prime minister tony blair , president jacques chirac of france , chancellor gerhard schroeder of germany , and canadian prime minister jean chretien .
mr bush is among three newly-elected leaders : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who was host to the 1994 g8 gathering in naples , were the others .
the meeting rotates between the g7 countries , and next year it will take place in canada .
what did the summit hope to accomplish ?
the summit had a broad agenda including the prospects for world economic growth , the importance of preventing future economic crises , and the need to help the world 's poor .
however , on some key issues there was little agreement .
europeans criticised the us attitude towards climate change after the collapse of negotiations over the kyoto treaty - which is being discussed separately in bonn .
the russians were concerned about the us missile defence plan , but in a surprise breakthrough , president vladimir putin agreed to open talks on the matter in conjunction with arms reduction negotiations .
there were also areas of agreement , for example in setting up a global health care fund to fight aids and a joint working group with african leaders to try to attack the continent 's worst problems .
who took part , and what was the schedule ?
the meeting began on friday lunchtime in the italian port city of genoa , where leaders discussed world trade , prospects for the world economy , and the reform of the world 's financial institutions -lrb- the world bank and imf -rrb- .
in the evening , leaders of african countries including south africa and mali were invited , along with the heads of the world health organisation , the food and agricultural organisation , and the un .
the leaders announced a plan for a $ 1bn global health fund to fight aids , tb and malaria .
on saturday , the leaders discussed poverty reduction and environmental issues before being joined by president putin of russia for lunch .
world affairs , including the situation in the middle east and the balkans , were the focus of that discussion .
what do the protesters want ?
the people who took to the streets of genoa believe that the g8 summits are fundamentally undemocratic because the world 's rich countries are taking decisions that affect the vast majority who have no say .
many also argue that the trade decisions taken by the g8 , for example in encouraging poor countries to open their markets to foreign multinationals , and encouraging free trade talks , are likely to lead to further impoverishment of those countries .
and many protesters object to the failure of the rich countries to reach agreement on environmental objectives , especially after the us decision to withdraw from the climate change treaty .
however , the protesters are a diverse group with different ideologies , ranging from green groups and anti-debt campaigners to anarchists and hard-line communists .
what have g8 summits accomplished ?
the first summits were largely concerned with economic policy , especially the collapse of the system of fixed exchange rates in the 1970s and their replacement by the floating exchange rates that we have now .
in the 1980s , the g7 summits - and the associated meetings of the finance ministers from the g7 countries - led to the plaza and louvre accords .
they helped stabilise the value of the dollar , which had become too high for the good of the world economy .
more recently , g8 summits have addressed issues like international terrorism , aid to russia and other parts of the former soviet union , and debt relief for poor countries - which was agreed in cologne in 1999 after mass demonstrations by the advocacy group jubilee 2000 .

although world trade , the economy and reform of the financial institutes are top of the agenda at the g8 summit in genoa , the world leaders , including south africa 's thabo mbeki and un secretary general kofi annan , discussed poverty reduction and the global health fund .
tb , malaria and aids have been pinpointed as the major global health threats , killing millions each year .
in the poorest countries , the poor are spending much more on their healthcare than people who are better off clare short expensive drugs in the developing countries , the leading causes of death of women aged between 15 and 44 are : tb - 9 % ; war -3 % ; hiv - 3 % and heart disease 3 % .
treatments for the diseases are costly and draining on the already fragile economies .
each year millions die because of a lack of cash for drugs .
although some pharmaceutical companies are supplying cheaper alternatives , life saving drugs are still out of the reach of many in areas like sub-saharan .
medical organisation medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- say doctors in kenya advise their aids patients " to save up for their funerals " rather than drugs , which cost too much .
malaria can be beaten with effective , but costly drugs although there have been many initiatives to tackle the global health this is a massive initiative by the world 's richest nations .
but this could be seen as a mere drop in the ocean , as some experts have said a global fund of $ 10bn a year is needed to have any impact at all on health .
whether the money will be used to provide drugs for those already suffering from disease , to prevent disease , or to find effective vaccines is not yet clear .
but it could be that the world leaders decide to divide the cash up amongst all three .
fighting disease britain has already pledged its $ 2000m contribution .
clare short , the uk international development secretary announced the five-year pledge at an international aids conference in june .
she said she would like to see the global fund modelled on the success of gavi , the global alliance for vaccines and immunology , which had increased the availability and reduced the price of vaccines in the poorest countries .
she said : " we believe that the global health fund can bring down the price and increase the supply of drugs and commodities for tb , hiv / aids and malaria and also encourage the research for new drugs . "
but she stressed that the cash should not be used for the development of health care systems in the poorer nations .
" in the poorest countries , the poor are spending much more on their healthcare than people who are better off .
enormous proportions of their income is being wasted on ineffective treatments , bad drugs and poor quality healthcare . "

although world trade , the economy and reform of the financial institutes are top of the agenda at the g8 summit in genoa , the world leaders , including south africa 's thabo mbeki and un secretary general kofi annan , discussed poverty reduction and the global health fund .
tb , malaria and aids have been pinpointed as the major global health threats , killing millions each year .
in the poorest countries , the poor are spending much more on their healthcare than people who are better off clare short expensive drugs in the developing countries , the leading causes of death of women aged between 15 and 44 are : tb - 9 % ; war -3 % ; hiv - 3 % and heart disease 3 % .
treatments for the diseases are costly and draining on the already fragile economies .
each year millions die because of a lack of cash for drugs .
although some pharmaceutical companies are supplying cheaper alternatives , life saving drugs are still out of the reach of many in areas like sub-saharan .
medical organisation medecins sans frontieres -lrb- msf -rrb- say doctors in kenya advise their aids patients " to save up for their funerals " rather than drugs , which cost too much .
although there have been many initiatives to tackle the global health this is a massive initiative by the world 's richest nations .
but this could be seen as a mere drop in the ocean , as some experts have said a global fund of $ 10bn a year is needed to have any impact at all on health .
whether the money will be used to provide drugs for those already suffering from disease , to prevent disease , or to find effective vaccines is not yet clear .
but it could be that the world leaders decide to divide the cash up amongst all three .
fighting disease britain has already pledged its $ 2000m contribution .
clare short , the uk international development secretary announced the five-year pledge at an international aids conference in june .
she said she would like to see the global fund modelled on the success of gavi , the global alliance for vaccines and immunology , which had increased the availability and reduced the price of vaccines in the poorest countries .
she said : " we believe that the global health fund can bring down the price and increase the supply of drugs and commodities for tb , hiv / aids and malaria and also encourage the research for new drugs . "
but she stressed that the cash should not be used for the development of health care systems in the poorer nations .
" in the poorest countries , the poor are spending much more on their healthcare than people who are better off .
enormous proportions of their income is being wasted on ineffective treatments , bad drugs and poor quality healthcare . "

it is a wide-ranging programme , designed to reduce poverty and place africa on a path of sustainable growth and development .
africa recognises that it holds the key to its own development new african initiative the 60-page document is the result of a merger of two separate plans drawn up in recent months .
president mbeki , together with nigerian leader olusegun obasanjo and algerian president abdelaziz bouteflika , had devised the so-called millennium africa recovery programme -lrb- map -rrb- , while senegal president abdoulaye wade had put forward the omega plan .
poverty the new merged plan points out that in africa , 340 million people , or half the population , live on less than $ 1 a day .
" the poverty and backwardness of africa stand in stark contrast to the prosperity of the developed world , " it says .
mbeki is in italy with the backing of africa 's leaders five years ago , there were 27 african nations in the list of the world 's least developed countries .
today , that number has risen to 34 .
for much of this year , president mbeki has been trying to gather international support for africa 's recovery .
the south african leader raised the issue at the world economic forum in davos in january .
more recently , he visited the united states , britain and germany .
now the african leaders directly involved in a new african initiative , are appealing to all the members of the g8 to back the plan .
partnership they are keen to stress that while foreign support is needed , africa is not asking for more aid .
president bush has backed the plan 's goals " in proposing the partnership , africa recognises that it holds the key to its own development , " states the document .
the african initiative calls for a new relationship between africa and the international community .
" in the past , european countries and the g8 focused on global financial structures and global economies " , said abdul minty , south africa 's foreign affairs deputy director-general .

now there is a very important dialogue between developed and developing countries , " he said .
african integration the launch of the recovery plan coincides with the emergence of the new african union , replacing the 38-year-old organisation of african unity -lrb- oau -rrb- .
speaking in a recent bbc interview , president mbeki said that for african countries which were poorer and less able to stand on their own than developed nations , the drive towards integration was far more urgent .
a new african initiative offers hope to a continent that is now trying to avoid being further marginalised in the global marketplace .
however , african leaders acknowledge that they must bring an end to conflict on the continent if there is to be investment and growth .
" if they spend more time discussing the economy , perhaps they wo n't fight as much , " a leading african union official commented optimistically .

it is the last hurrah for the jubilee debt campaign , which sent 100,000 to surround the g8 summit in cologne two years ago .
the debt campaigners are in the final phase of a three-year campaign to help relieve poverty , especially in sub-saharan africa .
the jubilee debt campaign - which attracted high-profile support from the pope to bono - was due to be wound up in december 2000 , but decided to extend its work to make one final push at the genoa summit .
debt campaigners are still calling for the complete cancellation of debt owed by developing countries .
the debt campaigners have made their feelings known internationally since 70,000 peaceful campaigners filled the streets of birmingham in may 1998 .
the following year in cologne , the g8 promised to write off about $ 100bn , but campaigners argue that few countries have benefitted so far .
now , alison marshall of the world development movement -lrb- wdm -rrb- is among those calling on world leaders to deliver more debt relief .
" they 've taken the plaudits and run .
tony blair ca n't walk away from debt relief when so little has been delivered , " she said .
a spokesman for christian aid said : " so far debt relief has failed the poor - it is time for a new deal on debt that puts poverty reduction first . "
g8 summit campaigners include members of organisations such as cafod , christian aid , mother 's union and oxfam .
the high profile supporters of the debt campaign - which had its origins in jubilee 2000 - include bono , bob geldof and muhammad ali .
although they say some g8 countries are sympathetic to the idea of doing more than they have already , they do not expect any concrete progress to be made at this meeting .
the summit aims to discuss ways of reducing poverty , combating aids as well as achieving sustainable development .
promise of help the g8 promise was that $ 100bn of the $ 260bn owed to the west by the most indebted states would be written off , provided lenders were satisfied that funds would be used to reduce poverty .
campaigners now want the imf and world bank to reduce their demands for debt repayments from these countries .
uk officials say that already $ 50bn has been spent on debt relief in 23 countries , and rolling out further relief now depends mainly on the efforts of those poor countries caught in a cycle of conflict and civil war .
in december last year , chancellor gordon brown cancelled all debts owed to britain by 41 of the world 's poorest countries .
this cost uk taxpayers about £ 640m in lost interest over the next 20 years .
campaigners ' arguments campaigners for urgent debt relief say that huge sums of money are going back to wealthy countries instead of feeding and educating children in the world 's poorest nations .
the money was originally borrowed in the 1970s and 1980s , often badly invested or squandered , and in many cases the loan repayments are far beyond the nations ' abilities to repay .
about 41 countries in africa , latin america and asia have been identified as " heavily indebted " .
the debts are mainly owed to three groups : western governments ; global financial institutions , including the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the world bank ; and private lenders .
the aim of this hipc scheme was to cut debt to sustainable levels for countries that show a sound economic record over a six-year period .
but many of these countries that have reached this target are still spending more on debt than health , argue debt campaigners .
campaigners find fault with the imf and world bank system for calculating debt relief .
this system calculates how much debt relief a company receives by looking at its exports , but ignores poverty levels .
under this system , a country is eligible for debt relief if its debt is 1.5 times its exports .
they want the g7 - which hold almost half the votes at the imf - to change the system .

by the bbc 's david loyn in zanzibar delegates from the world 's 49 poorest countries are beginning a summit meeting in zanzibar on sunday to try to halt further liberalisation in the world trade organisation .
they are concerned that they are being forced to open up their markets while they are not strong enough yet to trade with the west .
this conference has more potential to derail globalisation than anything happening on the streets of genoa .
cocoa is one africa 's most important exports but some say middlemen take the profits the least developed countries have come together at the invitation of tanzania .
trade minister , iddi simba is trying to get agreement on a declaration blocking any further trade liberalisation .
after talks stalled in seattle two years ago , the wto is meeting again in november .
but the least developed countries are angry that their agriculture , which they depend on , is being opened up to competition while the agriculture of europe and north america continues to receive subsidies .
promises they may not have much money but they do have votes and mr simba told me that they will block another trade round in the wto unless earlier promises made to them are kept .
the least developed countries are defined by the un as countries with an average income of less than $ 900 a year .
haiti is the only country in this category in the western hemisphere .
there are also a number of pacific islands represented but apart from bangladesh , the poorest countries with the largest populations are all in africa .

by the bbc 's david loyn in zanzibar delegates from the world 's 49 poorest countries are beginning a summit meeting in zanzibar on sunday to try to halt further liberalisation in the world trade organisation .
they are concerned that they are being forced to open up their markets while they are not strong enough yet to trade with the west .
this conference has more potential to derail globalisation than anything happening on the streets of genoa .
the least developed countries have come together at the invitation of tanzania .
trade minister , iddi simba is trying to get agreement on a declaration blocking any further trade liberalisation .
after talks stalled in seattle two years ago , the wto is meeting again in november .
but the least developed countries are angry that their agriculture , which they depend on , is being opened up to competition while the agriculture of europe and north america continues to receive subsidies .
promises they may not have much money but they do have votes and mr simba told me that they will block another trade round in the wto unless earlier promises made to them are kept .
the least developed countries are defined by the un as countries with an average income of less than $ 900 a year .
haiti is the only country in this category in the western hemisphere .
there are also a number of pacific islands represented but apart from bangladesh , the poorest countries with the largest populations are all in africa .

bulyanhulu mine near the northern town of mwanza , which now employs more than 900 people , is the biggest underground gold mine in the country .
it is owned by the canadian company barrick gold corporation and , after an investment of $ 280m , is forecast to produce about 400,000 ounces of gold a year we have a third modern world-class mine in operation .
this is a very exciting time in our country samuel lwakatare this will take tanzania 's annual gold output to more than a million ounces , bettered in africa only by ghana and south africa .
tanzania earned nearly $ 200m in tax revenues from gold mining last year , and bulyanhulu will substantially add to that figure .
samuel lwakatare , chairman of the tanzanian chamber of mines , believes the new mine will make an important contribution .
" we have a third modern world-class mine in operation , " he is quoted as saying .
" this is a very exciting time for our country . "
but there is a consistent and growing murmur of dissatisfaction about the mining industry in general in tanzania , and the successful gold mines are coming in for criticism too .
the lawyers environmental action team -lrb- leat -rrb- believes the country is not getting good value from the vast amounts of gold being extracted .
it is obvious this investment is not of benefit to tanzania .
it transfers the country 's resources outside lawyers environmental action team " it is obvious this investment is not of benefit to tanzania , " they said in an open letter .
" it transfers the country 's resources outside . "
leat is also lobbying for a share of the profits to go direct to local communities , including small-scale artisan miners who worked the area before barrick bought the rights .
they argue that barrick and other mining companies are both financially capable of paying up and morally responsible .
local population a group of mps from lake victoria zone , where many mines are situated , have made similar demands .
it should be the goal of every large-scale mining operation to foster co-operation and partnership with small scale miners tanzanian president mkapa at a recent meeting with minister for energy and minerals edgar maokola-majogo in tanzania 's official capital , dodoma , they demanded a system of profit redistribution similar to that of tanzania 's national parks .
the parks pay a quarter of their taxes direct to the local population , as a measure of compensation for restrictions on land use .
the government , however , may be unwilling to surrender this slice of the cake .
placate the mps also accused the mining companies of trying to placate the people with relatively small development projects .
mining companies often set up water facilities or build new roads in areas they operate in , but the mps said that the size of the mining companies ' profits made the developments projects look mean .
the mps actions come against the backdrop of a suspicion among many people that some of their representatives have been seduced and compromised by the big mining companies .
speaking at the opening ceremony of the new mine , president mkapa showed sympathy with the communities ' case .
" it should be the goal of each large-scale mining operation to foster constructive co-operation and partnership with small-scale miners " , he said .
but this tanzanian government has moved away from from its one-time socialist ideals .
it now prides itself on its free-wheeling economic credentials .
whether it will actually force the issue is far from clear .
