he was arrested with 12 of his close advisers after hijacking the elected government of mahendra chaudhry in what the rebels claimed was a nationalist revolt against the growing political influence of fiji 's ethnic indian minority .
as expected , defence lawyers have argued that an amnesty offered by senior army commanders in return for the safe release of the hostages a year ago still stands .
the military , which took control of the country after the parliament was stormed , claimed the amnesty agreement was breached by the rebels ' failure to return all weapons stolen from the army and used in the uprising .
the hearing will establish if there is enough evidence for there to be a treason trial in the high court .
mr speight will be transported under armed guard every day treason is a capital offence in fiji , although there have been no executions since independence from britain in 1970 .
the case has suffered repeated delays .
the prosecution has accused george speight of employing stalling tactics after he sacked his defence team last month , forcing yet another adjournment .
the situation became almost farcical when a us-based lawyer later appointed to defend mr speight was himself arrested and charged with possessing fake legal qualifications .
mr speight , a failed businessman , is now represented by a local lawyer kitione vuetaki .
he told the chief magistrate sailesi temo that his client is not disputing his role in the storming of the parliament last may , but has insisted the immunity agreement is still valid .
further adjournment the court was told that mr speight now wants all evidence to be presented in writing rather than read out and subject to cross-examination .
the request has prompted yet another adjournment , this time for two days .
prosecutors intend to call more than 250 witnesses , including the former president ratu sir kamisese mara , who was forced to resign after the uprising .
his evidence could be explosive .
the ageing former leader has accused senior public and political figures of supporting and financing last year 's coup .

every year the festivals manage to attract more internationally renowned artists to perform in two venues .
sting will perform at the baalbek festival pop singer sting , a play set to the music of the carmina burana , the flamenco guitarist paco de lucia , the hunchback of notre dame musical - these are but some of the performances that will take place this summer in lebanon .
the beiteddine festival is set in an old magnificent lebanese palace in the mountains south of beirut .
this festival tries to provide its audience with a mix of modern and classical and tries to interest the young in art .
the baalbek festival has more opera and classical music .
it first started in the 1950s when lebanon was known as the switzerland of the middle east .
reknowned artists the festival attracted artists like ella fitzgerald and rudolf nureyev , who were among the first to perform in the roman temples of baalbek - the best preserved and biggest roman temples in the world .
ella fitzgerald was among the first to perform in beirut this summer the festival 's concession to modern music is a concert by pop artist sting .
the two festivals , along with other smaller ones around the country , attract thousands of people from lebanon and abroad , making lebanon the place to be every summer in the middle east .
but this being lebanon and the middle east , there is always the possibility that politics and war might get in the way .
last sunday , an israeli air raid destroyed a syrian position in eastern lebanon and tension is still high in the region .
a french artist cancelled the concert he was supposed to hold in beirut this week .
but for the moment none of the performers at this summer 's festivals has pulled out .
they must share the lebanese motto in life that whatever happens , the show must go on .

mr mandela 's announcement followed his talks with five african heads of state on the eve of the organisation of african unity -lrb- oau -rrb- summit in the zambian capital , lusaka .
mr mandela refused to reveal details of the deal , but senior aides said it called for an ethnic tutsi to be president for 18 months , and then a hutu for the next 18 months .
a meeting is scheduled for tuesday with representatives of burundi 's 19 political factions , army commanders and rebels .
" therefore it would not be proper for us to spell out precisely what we have decided , " mr mandela said .
in earlier comments at lusaka airport , referring to tuesday 's planned meeting , mr mandela said , " i have got a surprise for everybody . "
the civil war between burundi 's majority hutu and minority tutsi has claimed more than 200,000 , mostly civilian , lives since 1993 .
mini-summit the mini-summit was attended by presidents burundi 's president , pierre buyoya , rwanda 's paul kagame , uganda 's yoweri museveni , kenya 's daniel arap moi , libya 's muammar gaddafi and tanzanian foreign minister jakaya kikwete .
president buyoya appeared less optimistic than mr mandela .
asked if he planned to attend the burundi peace talks scheduled for july 23 in arusha , tanzania , mr buyoya said , " maybe there will not be a meeting " .
he did not comment on the reported breakthrough , and referred reporters to mr mandela for more details .

the bbc 's transport reporter tom symonds looks at how the latest technology promises faster train travel on the west coast mainline .
virgin is heralding the return of the tilting high-speed train two decades after britain abandoned the technology .
the company is testing its new trains , which tilt left or right on bends to enable them to go faster without making passengers uncomfortable .
virgin 's pendolinos takes its name from the pendulum - it swings in and out of bends , smoothing the journey for passengers at high speeds .
the pendallinos will be able to travel at up to 140 miles an hour , compared with current speeds of around 110mph .
passengers on britain 's railway backbone will benefit most .
the hope is that tilting trains will begin running on the west coast main line in the second half of next year .
behind schedule railtrack is currently rebuilding sections of the line to enable trains to reach such high speeds , though the work is slightly behind schedule .
sir richard branson wants faster train travel for the first few years trains will travel at 125 mph .
but by 2005 the 140mph service will cut the journey time from london to glasgow by over an hour to 3 hours 55 minutes .
yet this is technology that was tried out 20 years ago .
the advanced passenger train , developed by british rail , has become known as a great british failure .
travel sickness its tilting carriages were far from reliable and some passengers complained of feeling sick .
dr alan wickins , who worked on the original project , said : " the problem of passenger comfort on the tilting train had been resolved .
" everyone realised instead of cancelling completely the centrifugal force passengers had to have a sense of going round the corner to prevent them feeling sick . "
" so we just reduced the amount of tilt . "
yet british rail was concerned at the length of time it was taking to make the train work - and in the early 80s scrapped it .
for that reason , the technology behind virgin 's pendolinos is italian - engineers in italy were also working on designs for tilting trains , which were introduced shortly afterwards and are still operating on the country 's railways .
there may still be concerns that the new tilting trains will make passengers feel uncomfortable - especially those who suffer from travel sickness .
glitzy ceremony like their predecessors at british rail , virgin will most want its new train to be reliable .
but introducing extremely fast trains does not necessarily involve making them tilt .
if the bends are not as sharp , the tilting mechanism is not needed .
the french railways have achieved high speed train travel by building straighter lines .
on friday virgin launched the new train in a glitzy ceremony , and will begin tests on a track in leicestershire .
next year , passengers will get their first taste of swinging train travel .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- flight chaos : what happened to you ?
front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- high graphics -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- feedback -pipe- help -pipe- noticias -pipe- newyddion -pipe- bbc sport > > high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- talking point contents : forum -pipe- bbc news online : talking point monday , 9 july , 2001 , 07:26 gmt 08:26 uk flight chaos : what happened to you ?
tourists heading to and from spain 's balearic islands are facing waits of many hours at airports because of a strike by spanish coach drivers .
flights to majorca , menorca and ibiza from airports including gatwick , manchester and glasgow are severely delayed - in some cases for more than 30 hours .
thousands of british , german and scandinavian holidaymakers trying to get home have also had to camp out at spanish airports , waiting for a flight .
have you or someone you know been caught up in the chaos ?
how delayed was the flight ?
what could airports do to cope with such problems ?
what did you do to keep your sanity while you waited ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the reps gave him food vouchers , crayons and books for the kids as well as constant updates graham , england my brother has just come back from majorca .
he had to wait quite a long time -lrb- over 8 hours -rrb- in the airport , before his flight .
however , he said his tour operator , airtours was on the ball whereas other people were complaining about just being left there .
the reps gave him food vouchers , crayons and books for the kids as well as constant updates , apologising when it was n't their fault .
graham , england hey everyone , stop going on shoddy tour operator holidays .
arrange it yourself and save loads of money .
we 've just come back from the algarve .
we drove there and back through france and spain .
it took 3 days to get there as we stopped off every 2/3 hours to have drink / food and a look around / swim in the sea .
you get to see a heck of a lot more places too .
we booked our hotel on the internet and arranged car cover with a french version of the aa who charged us only Â£ 56 for total travel cover .
so no waiting at airports , no coaches , no enforced walks , no taxis and no grumpy people .
what a fab holiday andy , london , uk i was trapped in the departure lounge at mahon for 23 hours .
this had very little to do with the strike , it had more to do with the incompetence of jmc .
mike duffy , england we recently returned from two weeks in the western isles -lrb- outer hebrides -rrb- .
no foot-and-mouth restrictions , very friendly locals , clean white deserted beaches as scenic as those in the caribbean , islands in abundance , and ferry and bus services that connected .
our only delay in 2 weeks was for 20 minutes as the bus driver stopped to let people take pictures of golden sand beaches on harris .
so - why go to the med ?
john kirriemuir , glasgow , scotland airport agencies try their best to avoid any problem ; i ca n't blame them qasim , canada last summer when i was coming back to canada from the uk , at manchester airport , we had delay of flight for 11 hours due to computer system shut down .
it was just like a fish market .
in the evening , we were sent to hotels .
i know airport agencies try their best to avoid any problem , i ca n't blame them .
i appreciate their efforts anyway .
qasim , canada one of the effects of low price holidays is that the costs have to be kept low .
so very little money of the price of a package tour goes to the coach firms let alone the coach drivers , who may have families and do like to eat etc .
a very small increase on the price of a holiday , say of about Â£ 2 a head , if passed on to the coach drivers would easily resolve the situation .
unfortunately this strike has been caused by the desire of people for cheap holidays without taking into account that this often means people doing jobs for low wages , and let 's be honest who can expect anybody to put up with that ?
in the end you get what you pay for , if you want guaranteed service from motivated people , you have to pay for it .
phil , uk i am travelling to ibiza on sunday and i am not worried paul jones , wales i think that the media has made everyone panic .
i am travelling to ibiza on sunday and i am not worried .
i have been informed that tour operators were told about the strikes but did nothing to help their customers .
i think that it is awful customer service .
i agree with the comment that if they want more money , then they should think of a career change .
after all , they can be easily be replaced .
hopefully , this will end soon , as people who travel do this to get away from stress not to get stuck in the middle of a crisis which has been intensified by the media .
paul jones , wales why stick at spain ?
if you want spanish try mexico , if you want adventure try south-east asia , if you want to both save money and support our beleaguered tourist industry , you could always stay in the uk .
if however you want underage nightclubs , dodgy ' english ' food , the costa-del-concrete , well ... and has there ever been a time when flights regularly get out to spain on time ?
do n't get shocked and upset when things go wrong !
tom , uk perhaps next season uk tourists should simply boycott the balearics .
give those on strike a season with no paying customers and perhaps they 'll not be in such a hurry to ruin holidays for those paying their wages .
chris , uk why do people choose to go on holiday in july and august ?
andy cotgreave , uk apart from the people with children of school age , who have little choice when to take their holiday , i have very little sympathy for those people stuck in delays .
why do they not use their imagination and go somewhere a little more interesting , and a little less congested ?
and why do people choose to go on holiday in july and august ?
i take my annual holidays in october or november : right now , the weather is beautiful in the uk - you must be daft to want to go somewhere else .
i guess that the people who jam themselves into these overly developed resorts allow the rest of us to enjoy less congested holidays in the uk and other parts of the world .
andy cotgreave , uk i do n't know why everybody is trying to make us look bad , it is just a strike -lrb- even if i do n't agree with it -rrb- you do n't have strikes ?
they are doing it because of something , not just for fun .
let 's face the problems or do you mean that in the holiday destinations we do n't have strike chances ?
do i have to say of all my experiences in english airports ?
what about the french controllers ?
everybody has right to strike .
it looks like some people are interested in making this strike looks criminal .
anyway have a good time if you come here .
abel belzunces , mallorca , spain i had a barbecue in my back garden and invited some friends over to enjoy the searing heat in that well-known sunspot called london .
i do n't understand why people take small kids to places like ibiza - a small child will be hard pressed to tell the difference between ibiza and bournemouth in the summer , you do n't have to change your currency and even the shambles that is our rail system has to be better than flight delays and european industrial inaction .
i think my next " hot and sunny " holiday will have to be florida .
john b , uk why bother going to these horrendous resorts anyway ?
ben , france -lrb- british -rrb- why bother going to these horrendous resorts anyway ?
all you 'll meet there are other british people .
why not get yourself somewhere with sun , culture and a real holiday rather than clacton in the sun ?
ben , paris , france -lrb- british -rrb- in answer to the question regarding children not being in school .
scotland has already finished for the summer .
also parents can withdraw their children for up to 10 days in any one school year for holidays .
they are cheaper now than in august .
english schools finish in one or two weeks time , depending on location , and the coach drivers will no doubt strike again then .
john , uk you can only keep people informed if you are being informed yourself kate , uk as a holiday rep i am only too aware of the problems and distress delays and strikes cause holidaymakers , i only wish people were a little bit more sympathetic to the holiday reps .
people tend to think the reps withhold information regarding the situations which is never the case , as i 'm sure your all aware you can only keep people informed if you are being informed yourself .
kate , uk i passed through palma airport on saturday .
we had to share a taxi to the airport -lrb- no hardship -rrb- and our flight was delayed by one hour .
our tour rep was very helpful , kept us informed at all times , and made all the arrangements for us .
we took food and drink to the airport in case .
we had no trouble finding seats .
beautiful beaches are not the only reasons for going to mallorca , i would go again next week if i could !
grace kelland , uk the coach drivers ' strike and passivity of the authorities gave a terrible and well deserved image of spain .
but , what about german and english tourists , just willing to get drunk as soon as possible in one of the most impressive ecologic paradises in europe -lrb- often drunk before landing in majorca -rrb- raton perez , lepe -lrb- spain -rrb- we 're going on a farm holiday in the uk - and i have to say i find it very hard to feel much sympathy for the majorca-bound masses .
as long as they are adequately insured , they 'll be fine - unlike the owners of holiday accommodation in the uk .
so come on , when you get back from your bus trip from hell , call the tourist board and get one of the late-booking bargains available at home !
guy chapman , uk i do n't understand the people supporting the coach drivers - hardly brain surgeons are they !
if they want more money then maybe they should do some exams and get a better job - otherwise be quiet and drive !
rick , uk i want to know why we are even considering joining europe at all .
if it 's not the spanish bus drivers it 's the french lorry drivers .
we should all head west for our holidays and tony blair should forget europe once and for all .
paul simpson , leicester , uk according to one newspaper the drivers are already paid Â£ 500 per week and were offered a 17 % rise , is this true or merely tabloid jingoism ?
whilst on the subject of tabloid jingoism , i await the first tabloid to hire a coach that will run through the strikers ' picket line whilst blaring " rule brittania " / gerry , uk why anyone in their right mind would book a holiday to a place where strikes and disruption seem to be the norm is beyond me .
not to mention that when you do get there , it 's seething with english people eating fish and chips .
may just as well stay home in that case .
you are not sheep and you do not have to go where hoards of others are going .
why not think outside the box and get creative ?
after all , your vacation is supposed to be an escape from stress not a nosedive into it .
i would n't go to spain or the balearics if it was free and you paid me .
brad , usa i am writing this from o " hare in chicago .
it is now 11:23 am cst .
my flight was supposed to take off at 10:30 am - yesterday !
robert del valle , usa people were treating it like they did with the petrol strike .
they panicked , everyone did alison rowe , scotland i was stuck at palma airport on saturday and basically everyone was going to the airport hours before their flights , because they were n't informed of the current situation .
even i left far too early .
taxi 's were still flowing to and from the airport and i had no problems getting three taxis to pick us up from our hotel .
people were treating it like they did with the petrol strike .
they panicked , everyone did .
alison rowe , scotland had a wonderful week 's holiday in ibiza , that was slightly spoiled by the coach drivers .
the reps did everything they could to get us to the airport on time and did n't do a bad job .
the plane company was appalling though .
they put us on to a different plane that had no food or drink on board .
that went to the wrong airport so we were put on another plane - still without any refreshments - back to london .
once at gatwick we had to wait for over two hours whilst the baggage handlers unloaded the plane , with no explanation for the delay ; they only managed to do four other planes in that time .
they were obviously affected by the coach strike too , huh ?
marcus , england we spent almost 12 hours in palma .
the tour operator was useless , they had no information and did n't seem to care much .
we were also extorted on the car hire for the airport with numerous " taxes and insurance , loaded onto the price and had " striking " drivers near our complex while the police did not appear until the small hours of friday .
we will not be back again .
ken , ireland airports ?
who needs ' em !
mark hildyard , england ... or for those who do n't need the ' social cachet ' of crossing a large expanse of water - you could just holiday in the uk this year !
-lrb- it 's not like there are n't any " excellent " bargains to be had down in the west country - post f & md ... -rrb- - airports ?
who needs ' em !
mark hildyard , england i have sympathy for the coach drivers if they are as grossly underpaid as our own coach drivers then good luck to them .
louise , uk i have seen so many complaints from " families with children " about their poor treatment .
what i do n't understand is why the children are n't in school .
no schools have broken up for summer holidays yet , so how come all these kids are stuck at gatwick being bored ?
if they were in school where they belonged , there would n't be any problems .
daniel clayden , england my daughter was due to fly back from malaga early hours of this morning , she originally called around 8pm sunday to say the flight was going to arrive approx 30 mins early , but then call to say she was delayed a minimum of 8 hours but they had been given a hotel room for the night .
considering this was a cheap and cheerful holiday for a group of students celebrating their degree results , it just goes to show what tour operators really can do !
thank you going places jennifer kaye-wilton , uk if it 's not the bus drivers , it 's the taxi drivers alex banks , uk , living in holland why do people bother going to spain ?
if it 's not the bus drivers , it 's the taxi drivers , the pilots or the air traffic controllers .
it 's not like strikes in spain have never affected tourists before .
go somewhere else for your holiday in future - that 'll fix the problems .
i have a suspicion that some brits have a sadistic streak in them - why else would they subject themselves to massive delays year after year ?
i 've never been to spain and i still do n't intend to go .
alex banks , uk , living in holland i spent over 15 hours stuck in the departure lounge of palma airport this weekend .
the tour operator reps were not keeping holidaymakers informed .
i will not be going back to the country again .
now i know what cattle feel like .
sean o 'sullivan , england we were meant to fly out at 1730 on friday from mahon to stansted .
we left 0415 saturday and without prior knowledge taken to gatwick !
one bottle of water , no food , no reps air side .
pickets stopped taxis 1 mile from the airport and made people -lrb- including families with babes in arms -rrb- walk to the terminal in the heat of the midday sun .
everyone should boycott the balearics for the next year .
then they would find out what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you .
shirley and david drain , uk i 'm sorry guys but i agree with the coach drivers henry willis , england i 'm sorry guys but i agree with the coach drivers .
if you are able to go on holiday it is because you are paid a sufficient amount of money .
why should the spanish coach drivers be any different ?
henry willis , england what worries me more , was the ease with which we changed our flights and nobody even checked our id or queried our tickets .
no departure cards were given - and security was non-existence .
one word describes the scene at palma airport last night - chaos .
the airport was covered with covered with beds , cots and rotting food .
we wanted to travel back to frankfurt wth a german charter company .
the information and assistance was diabolical .
it was n't only the british companies affected - the local representatives were totally overwhelmed .
stephen , germany one of the tour operators claimed this weekend that the problems were not of their making .
is it not true that 90 % of coaches -lrb- and their drivers -rrb- are run by directly owned subsidiaries of the tour operators ?
if this is the case , they are directly responsible , and should admit it .
also they should pay their employees a reasonable amount , so that their customers get what they save so long to pay for - 2 weeks holiday to relax out of 52 weeks working .
tim bungard , england why does everyone want to travel in july and august ?
mark , hong kong why does everyone want to travel in july and august ?
why not take your holidays some other time , or go somewhere the masses are n't .
come out east .
there are wonderful things to see in laos , vietnam and china , fabulous beaches in the philippines , indonesia and the maldives -lrb- all child-friendly -rrb- and terrific adventures to be had in new zealand , korea and japan .
air travel is getting much cheaper .
come and see asia before the hordes arrive .
mark , hong kong my heart bleeds .
here in the states we 're lucky to get two weeks off annually after years of thankless devotion to our masters .
consider yourself lucky to have a plastic seat at gatwick to sit in whilst waiting for the possibility of one of your all too many holidays .
werner l. stunkel , usa all i can say is , there are plenty of destinations beyond europe that one can go to , and for a lot less money , and far better service .
steve scott , malaysia my heart went out to the reps who had to put up with endless abuse from irate british travellers mark taylor , england i 've just got back from majorca with a friend after waiting for a plane that was due to fly to gatwick on saturday night at 8.00pm , it did n't leave until 6.00am in the morning .
palma airport was absolute chaos .
food vouchers were being given out to only airtours customers in the terminal we were waiting in , so my friend and i were without food and money for at least 10 hours - the in-flight meal seemed luxurious .
my heart went out to the reps who had to put up with endless abuse from irate british travellers .
that 's a job i would n't go for in a hurry .
i had a fantastic holiday in magalluf , it was such a shame it had to end in such a way .
mark taylor , england come to california , we have beaches , disneyland , sea world .
we would love to see you .
harry rose , usa my niece flew out to palma airport on saturday and said the queues for taxis was ridiculous .
they decided to walk in to the villa they were staying at , and flagged a taxi down on its way back to the airport .
anyone on their way out there should think about getting out on the roads to flag a cab .
it seems that if the air traffic controllers do n't cause problems someone else will .
ian , england after 26 hours at manchester i took the option to accept cancellation and return home .
disappointing but preferrable to flying out to menorca and probably a worse experience there , including uncertainty for next weekend .
i feel airtours were pretty good , it was a nightmare for the frontline staff with whom i was impressed given the trying circumstances and some unreasonable people .
the problem is with the strikers not the airport and tour operators ' staff .
mostly , though , people were calm and accepting of the situation and life at airport was not hell .
extra seating was laid on and rooms made available .
overnight accommodation was provided by airtours together with meal vouchers .
thank you to the staff for doing your best .
it wo n't be balearics if we re-book later this summer .
a hill , england last year i waited eight hours and there was n't a strike .
we got no food or information .
i 'm going to ibiza next sunday and i 'm thinking about cancelling because i 'm going to unwind - not to catch some disease while sat in an overcrowded airport lounge for three days .
matt shelley , london i am hoping to travel to majorca with my son next sunday .
from my experiences of flying to the balearics in the past , overcowded aiports and flight delays are nothing unusual .
the same can be said for ill informed tour reps. it 's all part of the holiday experience .
timothy holloway , england if it is not the spanish coach drivers , it is air traffic controllers neil small , scotland why not just go somewhere else ?
you always get delayed at palma normally anyway .
if it is not the spanish coach drivers , it is air traffic controllers .
every year the same .
america is getting cheaper to fly to every year .
let 's all go there .
neil small , scotland i have just returned back from a holiday in menorca .
we were due to leave the island on 29 friday on the 1650 flight to glasgow .
got to the airport with great difficulty , on the way there saw families carrying their bags and pushing prams about 1/2 to 1 kilometre away from the airport .
got to the airport , a rough estimate of no less than 1,000 people with more than half of that number with children and babies .
all the holiday reps there had no clue about anything whatsoever .
managed with great difficulty to get checked into a flight to gatwick .
my heart goes out to any families who are still stuck there , outside the airport with no way of getting back to their resorts and no idea as to when they are to fly out , with mosquitoes eating them alive .
all that i can say is that it was the worst possible weekend for this to happen .
the taxi drivers were charging what they wanted for the journey in the vicinity of the airport .
like i said before we were very lucky to make it out of that situation .
my thoughts are with the people still stuck there .
monica lewis , uk we have 3 small children and were on holiday in alcudia .
we were told to be at reception on 30 june at 0520 .
we then waited 7 hours before a taxi finally collected us and took us to palma by which time we had missed our scheduled flight .
we then had to wait a further 14 hours before we finally got a flight .
so , 23 hours with 3 children and nothing to keep them occupied , little or no information and with the threat of palma being closed to incoming traffic was a living nightmare .
andrew kain , england we were supposed to fly to menorca on friday at 1.30pm.
while travelling to teesside airport we heard that there were delays .
we contacted the airline and were told to check-in as normal but that there would be a delay .
on arrival staff were available from the airport and the airline to keep us informed of the situation .
entertainment was laid on for the kids , and the facilities in the airport were excellent , including very helpful staff .
-lrb- as someone who flies regularly on business , i have to say that this was a bonus -rrb- .
unfortunately the flight was delayed until saturday , so we were put up in a hotel .
the next day the flight was cancelled and with it our holiday .
disappointing , of course , mainly for our children who were really looking forward to getting away to the sun .
however , i have sympathy for the bus drivers having heard of their demands from a contact in menorca .
i have nothing but thanks to the airport staff at teesside and the airline staff from airtours who were helpful and genuinely sympathetic .
refunds have already been arranged .
back home in glasgow now trying to organise a holiday via the internet , so hopefully we should be able to salvage something .
would i arrange to go again ?
only after searching the net for " balearics " and " strike action " paul coffey , scotland buses leave on the hour virtually every hour from the main bus depot in palma to most major resorts .
although not ideal , these buses are economical , air-conditioned and comfortable .
we returned from mallorca a week ago and throughout our two-week stay , used the service extensively .
please , if possible , make the people going through this nightmare aware of this lisa moneypenny , england i am due to fly to ibiza with my wife and two young children next sunday .
i am very concerned that this strike will still be on .
it must be costing the tour operators and airlines millions .
why do n't they give the coach drivers what they want , it 's small amount compared with the losses the above companies must be absorbing .
i think it is absolutely disgusting the way holidaymakers have been treated this weekend .
come on tour operators do something about it .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- flight chaos : what happened to you ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo monday , 9 july , 2001 , 07:26 gmt 08:26 uk flight chaos : what happened to you ?
tourists heading to and from spain 's balearic islands are facing waits of many hours at airports because of a strike by spanish coach drivers .
flights to majorca , menorca and ibiza from airports including gatwick , manchester and glasgow are severely delayed - in some cases for more than 30 hours .
thousands of british , german and scandinavian holidaymakers trying to get home have also had to camp out at spanish airports , waiting for a flight .
have you or someone you know been caught up in the chaos ?
how delayed was the flight ?
what could airports do to cope with such problems ?
what did you do to keep your sanity while you waited ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the reps gave him food vouchers , crayons and books for the kids as well as constant updates graham , england my brother has just come back from majorca .
he had to wait quite a long time -lrb- over 8 hours -rrb- in the airport , before his flight .
however , he said his tour operator , airtours was on the ball whereas other people were complaining about just being left there .
the reps gave him food vouchers , crayons and books for the kids as well as constant updates , apologising when it was n't their fault .
graham , england hey everyone , stop going on shoddy tour operator holidays .
arrange it yourself and save loads of money .
we 've just come back from the algarve .
we drove there and back through france and spain .
it took 3 days to get there as we stopped off every 2/3 hours to have drink / food and a look around / swim in the sea .
you get to see a heck of a lot more places too .
we booked our hotel on the internet and arranged car cover with a french version of the aa who charged us only Â£ 56 for total travel cover .
so no waiting at airports , no coaches , no enforced walks , no taxis and no grumpy people .
what a fab holiday andy , london , uk i was trapped in the departure lounge at mahon for 23 hours .
this had very little to do with the strike , it had more to do with the incompetence of jmc .
mike duffy , england we recently returned from two weeks in the western isles -lrb- outer hebrides -rrb- .
no foot-and-mouth restrictions , very friendly locals , clean white deserted beaches as scenic as those in the caribbean , islands in abundance , and ferry and bus services that connected .
our only delay in 2 weeks was for 20 minutes as the bus driver stopped to let people take pictures of golden sand beaches on harris .
so - why go to the med ?
john kirriemuir , glasgow , scotland airport agencies try their best to avoid any problem ; i ca n't blame them qasim , canada last summer when i was coming back to canada from the uk , at manchester airport , we had delay of flight for 11 hours due to computer system shut down .
it was just like a fish market .
in the evening , we were sent to hotels .
i know airport agencies try their best to avoid any problem , i ca n't blame them .
i appreciate their efforts anyway .
qasim , canada one of the effects of low price holidays is that the costs have to be kept low .
so very little money of the price of a package tour goes to the coach firms let alone the coach drivers , who may have families and do like to eat etc .
a very small increase on the price of a holiday , say of about Â£ 2 a head , if passed on to the coach drivers would easily resolve the situation .
unfortunately this strike has been caused by the desire of people for cheap holidays without taking into account that this often means people doing jobs for low wages , and let 's be honest who can expect anybody to put up with that ?
in the end you get what you pay for , if you want guaranteed service from motivated people , you have to pay for it .
phil , uk i am travelling to ibiza on sunday and i am not worried paul jones , wales i think that the media has made everyone panic .
i am travelling to ibiza on sunday and i am not worried .
i have been informed that tour operators were told about the strikes but did nothing to help their customers .
i think that it is awful customer service .
i agree with the comment that if they want more money , then they should think of a career change .
after all , they can be easily be replaced .
hopefully , this will end soon , as people who travel do this to get away from stress not to get stuck in the middle of a crisis which has been intensified by the media .
paul jones , wales why stick at spain ?
if you want spanish try mexico , if you want adventure try south-east asia , if you want to both save money and support our beleaguered tourist industry , you could always stay in the uk .
if however you want underage nightclubs , dodgy ' english ' food , the costa-del-concrete , well ... and has there ever been a time when flights regularly get out to spain on time ?
do n't get shocked and upset when things go wrong !
tom , uk perhaps next season uk tourists should simply boycott the balearics .
give those on strike a season with no paying customers and perhaps they 'll not be in such a hurry to ruin holidays for those paying their wages .
chris , uk why do people choose to go on holiday in july and august ?
andy cotgreave , uk apart from the people with children of school age , who have little choice when to take their holiday , i have very little sympathy for those people stuck in delays .
why do they not use their imagination and go somewhere a little more interesting , and a little less congested ?
and why do people choose to go on holiday in july and august ?
i take my annual holidays in october or november : right now , the weather is beautiful in the uk - you must be daft to want to go somewhere else .
i guess that the people who jam themselves into these overly developed resorts allow the rest of us to enjoy less congested holidays in the uk and other parts of the world .
andy cotgreave , uk i do n't know why everybody is trying to make us look bad , it is just a strike -lrb- even if i do n't agree with it -rrb- you do n't have strikes ?
they are doing it because of something , not just for fun .
let 's face the problems or do you mean that in the holiday destinations we do n't have strike chances ?
do i have to say of all my experiences in english airports ?
what about the french controllers ?
everybody has right to strike .
it looks like some people are interested in making this strike looks criminal .
anyway have a good time if you come here .
abel belzunces , mallorca , spain i had a barbecue in my back garden and invited some friends over to enjoy the searing heat in that well-known sunspot called london .
i do n't understand why people take small kids to places like ibiza - a small child will be hard pressed to tell the difference between ibiza and bournemouth in the summer , you do n't have to change your currency and even the shambles that is our rail system has to be better than flight delays and european industrial inaction .
i think my next " hot and sunny " holiday will have to be florida .
john b , uk why bother going to these horrendous resorts anyway ?
ben , france -lrb- british -rrb- why bother going to these horrendous resorts anyway ?
all you 'll meet there are other british people .
why not get yourself somewhere with sun , culture and a real holiday rather than clacton in the sun ?
ben , paris , france -lrb- british -rrb- in answer to the question regarding children not being in school .
scotland has already finished for the summer .
also parents can withdraw their children for up to 10 days in any one school year for holidays .
they are cheaper now than in august .
english schools finish in one or two weeks time , depending on location , and the coach drivers will no doubt strike again then .
john , uk you can only keep people informed if you are being informed yourself kate , uk as a holiday rep i am only too aware of the problems and distress delays and strikes cause holidaymakers , i only wish people were a little bit more sympathetic to the holiday reps .
people tend to think the reps withhold information regarding the situations which is never the case , as i 'm sure your all aware you can only keep people informed if you are being informed yourself .
kate , uk i passed through palma airport on saturday .
we had to share a taxi to the airport -lrb- no hardship -rrb- and our flight was delayed by one hour .
our tour rep was very helpful , kept us informed at all times , and made all the arrangements for us .
we took food and drink to the airport in case .
we had no trouble finding seats .
beautiful beaches are not the only reasons for going to mallorca , i would go again next week if i could !
grace kelland , uk the coach drivers ' strike and passivity of the authorities gave a terrible and well deserved image of spain .
but , what about german and english tourists , just willing to get drunk as soon as possible in one of the most impressive ecologic paradises in europe -lrb- often drunk before landing in majorca -rrb- raton perez , lepe -lrb- spain -rrb- we 're going on a farm holiday in the uk - and i have to say i find it very hard to feel much sympathy for the majorca-bound masses .
as long as they are adequately insured , they 'll be fine - unlike the owners of holiday accommodation in the uk .
so come on , when you get back from your bus trip from hell , call the tourist board and get one of the late-booking bargains available at home !
guy chapman , uk i do n't understand the people supporting the coach drivers - hardly brain surgeons are they !
if they want more money then maybe they should do some exams and get a better job - otherwise be quiet and drive !
rick , uk i want to know why we are even considering joining europe at all .
if it 's not the spanish bus drivers it 's the french lorry drivers .
we should all head west for our holidays and tony blair should forget europe once and for all .
paul simpson , leicester , uk according to one newspaper the drivers are already paid Â£ 500 per week and were offered a 17 % rise , is this true or merely tabloid jingoism ?
whilst on the subject of tabloid jingoism , i await the first tabloid to hire a coach that will run through the strikers ' picket line whilst blaring " rule brittania " / gerry , uk why anyone in their right mind would book a holiday to a place where strikes and disruption seem to be the norm is beyond me .
not to mention that when you do get there , it 's seething with english people eating fish and chips .
may just as well stay home in that case .
you are not sheep and you do not have to go where hoards of others are going .
why not think outside the box and get creative ?
after all , your vacation is supposed to be an escape from stress not a nosedive into it .
i would n't go to spain or the balearics if it was free and you paid me .
brad , usa i am writing this from o " hare in chicago .
it is now 11:23 am cst .
my flight was supposed to take off at 10:30 am - yesterday !
robert del valle , usa people were treating it like they did with the petrol strike .
they panicked , everyone did alison rowe , scotland i was stuck at palma airport on saturday and basically everyone was going to the airport hours before their flights , because they were n't informed of the current situation .
even i left far too early .
taxi 's were still flowing to and from the airport and i had no problems getting three taxis to pick us up from our hotel .
people were treating it like they did with the petrol strike .
they panicked , everyone did .
alison rowe , scotland had a wonderful week 's holiday in ibiza , that was slightly spoiled by the coach drivers .
the reps did everything they could to get us to the airport on time and did n't do a bad job .
the plane company was appalling though .
they put us on to a different plane that had no food or drink on board .
that went to the wrong airport so we were put on another plane - still without any refreshments - back to london .
once at gatwick we had to wait for over two hours whilst the baggage handlers unloaded the plane , with no explanation for the delay ; they only managed to do four other planes in that time .
they were obviously affected by the coach strike too , huh ?
marcus , england we spent almost 12 hours in palma .
the tour operator was useless , they had no information and did n't seem to care much .
we were also extorted on the car hire for the airport with numerous " taxes and insurance , loaded onto the price and had " striking " drivers near our complex while the police did not appear until the small hours of friday .
we will not be back again .
ken , ireland airports ?
who needs ' em !
mark hildyard , england ... or for those who do n't need the ' social cachet ' of crossing a large expanse of water - you could just holiday in the uk this year !
-lrb- it 's not like there are n't any " excellent " bargains to be had down in the west country - post f & md ... -rrb- - airports ?
who needs ' em !
mark hildyard , england i have sympathy for the coach drivers if they are as grossly underpaid as our own coach drivers then good luck to them .
louise , uk i have seen so many complaints from " families with children " about their poor treatment .
what i do n't understand is why the children are n't in school .
no schools have broken up for summer holidays yet , so how come all these kids are stuck at gatwick being bored ?
if they were in school where they belonged , there would n't be any problems .
daniel clayden , england my daughter was due to fly back from malaga early hours of this morning , she originally called around 8pm sunday to say the flight was going to arrive approx 30 mins early , but then call to say she was delayed a minimum of 8 hours but they had been given a hotel room for the night .
considering this was a cheap and cheerful holiday for a group of students celebrating their degree results , it just goes to show what tour operators really can do !
thank you going places jennifer kaye-wilton , uk if it 's not the bus drivers , it 's the taxi drivers alex banks , uk , living in holland why do people bother going to spain ?
if it 's not the bus drivers , it 's the taxi drivers , the pilots or the air traffic controllers .
it 's not like strikes in spain have never affected tourists before .
go somewhere else for your holiday in future - that 'll fix the problems .
i have a suspicion that some brits have a sadistic streak in them - why else would they subject themselves to massive delays year after year ?
i 've never been to spain and i still do n't intend to go .
alex banks , uk , living in holland i spent over 15 hours stuck in the departure lounge of palma airport this weekend .
the tour operator reps were not keeping holidaymakers informed .
i will not be going back to the country again .
now i know what cattle feel like .
sean o 'sullivan , england we were meant to fly out at 1730 on friday from mahon to stansted .
we left 0415 saturday and without prior knowledge taken to gatwick !
one bottle of water , no food , no reps air side .
pickets stopped taxis 1 mile from the airport and made people -lrb- including families with babes in arms -rrb- walk to the terminal in the heat of the midday sun .
everyone should boycott the balearics for the next year .
then they would find out what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you .
shirley and david drain , uk i 'm sorry guys but i agree with the coach drivers henry willis , england i 'm sorry guys but i agree with the coach drivers .
if you are able to go on holiday it is because you are paid a sufficient amount of money .
why should the spanish coach drivers be any different ?
henry willis , england what worries me more , was the ease with which we changed our flights and nobody even checked our id or queried our tickets .
no departure cards were given - and security was non-existence .
one word describes the scene at palma airport last night - chaos .
the airport was covered with covered with beds , cots and rotting food .
we wanted to travel back to frankfurt wth a german charter company .
the information and assistance was diabolical .
it was n't only the british companies affected - the local representatives were totally overwhelmed .
stephen , germany one of the tour operators claimed this weekend that the problems were not of their making .
is it not true that 90 % of coaches -lrb- and their drivers -rrb- are run by directly owned subsidiaries of the tour operators ?
if this is the case , they are directly responsible , and should admit it .
also they should pay their employees a reasonable amount , so that their customers get what they save so long to pay for - 2 weeks holiday to relax out of 52 weeks working .
tim bungard , england why does everyone want to travel in july and august ?
mark , hong kong why does everyone want to travel in july and august ?
why not take your holidays some other time , or go somewhere the masses are n't .
come out east .
there are wonderful things to see in laos , vietnam and china , fabulous beaches in the philippines , indonesia and the maldives -lrb- all child-friendly -rrb- and terrific adventures to be had in new zealand , korea and japan .
air travel is getting much cheaper .
come and see asia before the hordes arrive .
mark , hong kong my heart bleeds .
here in the states we 're lucky to get two weeks off annually after years of thankless devotion to our masters .

neil small , scotland i have just returned back from a holiday in menorca .
we were due to leave the island on 29 friday on the 1650 flight to glasgow .
got to the airport with great difficulty , on the way there saw families carrying their bags and pushing prams about 1/2 to 1 kilometre away from the airport .
got to the airport , a rough estimate of no less than 1,000 people with more than half of that number with children and babies .
all the holiday reps there had no clue about anything whatsoever .

we returned from mallorca a week ago and throughout our two-week stay , used the service extensively .
please , if possible , make the people going through this nightmare aware of this lisa moneypenny , england i am due to fly to ibiza with my wife and two young children next sunday .
i am very concerned that this strike will still be on .
it must be costing the tour operators and airlines millions .
why do n't they give the coach drivers what they want , it 's small amount compared with the losses the above companies must be absorbing .
i think it is absolutely disgusting the way holidaymakers have been treated this weekend .
come on tour operators do something about it .

the resignation of david trimble as first minister of northern ireland has increased uncertainty about the future of the peace process .
mr trimble quit in protest against the failure of the ira to meet in full a commitment to put its weapons beyond use .
his resignation comes at a time of rising tension surrounding the annual protestant parades , which have in the past sparked sectarian violence in the province .
the parties have six weeks to resolve the crisis before new elections are called or devolution is suspended .
do you think mr trimble should have resigned ?
is there room for compromise ?
where next for northern ireland ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction david trimble 's resignation was the right thing to do and an inevitable consequence of his twisting and turning over the past few years .
the plain fact is that the ira at no time gave a commitment to decommission in the manner he now claims they did .
his crucial failure during the good friday negotiations was to allow bill clinton and tony blair to fudge and spin the issue .
he should have done what jeffery donaldson did and walk out , having failed to secure this crucial concession .
james charter , england the peace process needs something like this to get people to realise that promises have not been kept suzanne mcmillan , japan , -lrb- northern ireland -rrb- yes i do think trimble should have resigned - the peace process needs something like this to get people to realise that promises have not been kept .
admittedly , i am disappointed that it has come to need this , i admire and respect all that david trimble has achieved for northern ireland .
however , perhaps this move will get us off the roller coaster ride of process and on to something more permanent .
suzanne mcmillan , japan , -lrb- northern ireland -rrb- of course trimble should resign .
he is not able to run his own party .
he is more dominated by paisley and the loyalist murderers than adams ever was by the ira .
after all these years and all this misery the truth about ni still does n't get spoken nor the right questions asked .
why are the loyalists so interested in ensuring that peace never comes ?
they are allied to the ruling culture - we need questions to be asked about who benefits from the continuing violence and how ?
i am relieved to see that i am not the only one on this board asking why there 's so much focus on ira decommissioning when the loyalists are committing daily acts of violence and provocation against catholics .
now let 's hear these questions being asked by the media and by the various governments .
gina , uk no one said it was going to be easy !
harry , northern ireland when people ask me " how 's life in northern ireland " i always reply " it 's better than the alternative " .
has n't it been a refreshing few years since that good friday where we have all been able to judge our politicians based on the real tasks they have been given in government to serve us , their community , with the real power to make changes .
even more refreshing when compared to the previous 25 years where all we could vote for was the colour of their past from years of shouting and rhetoric .
keep going forward , guys , we 've suffered the pain through many years and struggled a little for three .
deja vu is n't an option and the alternative to life does n't look too good either .
no one said it was going to be easy !
harry , northern ireland what is called for is that the weapons be put beyond use , verifiably .
this has been verified by an international commission .
trimble should return to the assembly or retire from politics .
cormac mcgettigan , canada the plain truth is that the terrorist weapons are not silent , both republican and loyalist weapons are being used on a regular basis .
intimidation and violence is still being employed by the terrorists to exert their control over their so-called own areas .
trimble or any other democratic leader could not remain in leadership of any country in these circumstances , in short he had to resign .
roy , n. ireland if weapons are to be handed in for destruction then why do n't they get on with what they agreed to two years ago bill mccreadie , scotland i 'm so tired of this ambiguous phrase ' put weapons beyond use ' .
what exactly does this mean ?
and why wo n't gerry adams give a straight answer to a straight question .
is it down to the usual ' politician syndrome ' - never answer a question ?
if weapons are to be handed in for destruction then why do n't they get on with what they agreed to two years ago - surely it ca n't just be bloody-mindedness ?
bill mccreadie , scotland it 's not as though the ira are the only ones holding on to illegal weapons in this process .
i 'm no fan of the ira , being old enough to remember the birmingham pub bombings and the other atrocities committed by ira people over the years .
nevertheless , it is time the politicians in northern ireland stopped playing the " blame everyone else " game and started to deliver the kind of performance i 'm sure their voters expected of them .
let them all -lrb- unionists and republicans alike -rrb- stop trying to push the problem on to the uk and irish governments all the time , and start to show some willingness to tackle their own problems .
after all , these problems are largely the result of past actions by these self-same political parties .
david hazel , uk wait a couple weeks and it will be abundantly clear why the ira should not decommission one bullet .
everyone talks about the ira destroying weapons .
what about the loyalist terror groups ?
have they disarmed ?
have things changed that drastically that the catholic community in n.i. would be willing to live defenceless in this current state ?
with the marching season starting shortly it will once again show the world why decommissioning should not even be a factor in the agreement .
the time will eventually come but it will be on mutual terms .
brian , usa decommissioning should never have been allowed to derail the peace process .
right from the start the deal should have been political concessions in exchange for the cessation of violence .
gerry adams has said about the ira , " if the dog 's sleeping , why kick it ? " .
there are hundreds of people walking the streets who would be dead or maimed now if it had not been for the cease-fires .
what do the extreme unionists want - return to the sickening cycle of violence that we had in the early 90s ?
as for the long term , the solution is obviously for permanent dual sovereignty between the uk and the republic .
william , acton , england if mr trimble really wants to see the ira disarm , he should be pushing for the continual loyalist violence against the nationalist community to stop muiris , wales + ireland my understanding is that mr trimble has said that republicans should be punished by stopping the reform of the ruc -lrb- northern ireland police service -rrb- .
is that kind of attitude likely to endear the ruc to the nationalist community as it effectively admits that the ruc is a partisan force for the benefit of one community and not all of the people of northern ireland .
if mr trimble really wants to see the ira disarm he should be pushing for the continual loyalist violence -lrb- well reported by the bbc -rrb- against the nationalist community to stop , he should be championing the creation of a force which will have the respect of all the community - it is unlikely that the ira would then feel able to attack them - the cycle of silence in the nationalist community would be broken as we would have an active role in the policing of northern ireland and some of us would be in the police !
i wonder how many of the potential recruits from my community who recently showed an interest in joining a new reformed police service feel now ?
to finish i would like to congratulate mr trimble for linking the police and the ira together as if they are two sides of the same coin - well done , you 've put us back years !
muiris , wales + ireland i do n't agree with mr trimble resigning .
i have no love for sinn fein or the ira .
but they have not used their guns .
guns that could be replaced the next day even if they handed them in to be destroyed .
i believe that there must not be enough goodwill to have the courage to make the executive work and let the issue of arms fall by the wayside .
kieran mccartan , n. ireland we have to compromise if this situation is ever going to be resolved john , usa do we really believe for one minute that the arms dumps that the ira has shown to the arms inspectors are only ones they have or that they even contain their most modern weapons ?
i do n't think so .
if that is the case , why do n't they just hand over those weapons for destruction as a gesture of good faith .
it 's time for all sides to give up something .
we ca n't have everything we want in life .
it 's not a perfect world .
we have to compromise if this situation is ever going to be resolved .
john , usa i used to follow the situation in ni intently , being a descendant of an ulster-scot born in belfast in the 1740s .
but i 'm frankly bored with it now .
it 's all re-runs .
no wonder my ancestor left .
thank god he did .
roy , usa the only way to end all this is to show beyond a doubt that the political solution works .
trimble 's resignation gives evidence that it does not work .
krow , usa the royal ulster constabulary recently showed itself unable to protect children on their way to school from violence .
will this sectarian outfit be able to keep order on july 12th ?
g , usa the issue of the gun and the violence today is more from the unionist community and the continued sectarian attacks .
if there is a group that needs to disarm it is the loyalist paramilitary groups first .
the republican side does need to turn over all explosives , because these are the real indiscriminate killers .
they should retain the rifles and pistols as a matter of self-defence against bigoted attacks .
every man , woman or child has the right to self-defence and self-determination .
the sectarian violence must end and that people must learn to respect the differences in religion before there can be peace .
keith , usa there should be another referendum in northern ireland , asking the question " what should be the fate of northern ireland ?
a. join the republic of ireland .
b. form an independent northern ireland , free of both the republic of ireland and the united kingdom . "
the option to remain part of the united kingdom should not appear on the ballot , because it 's obvious that that option has n't worked and is not going to .
voting on this issue ought to be compulsory , in order to get the clearest possible view of how people in northern ireland feel about their own fate .
a. , usa can someone explain to me why no one is questioning the refusal of the loyalist paramilitary groups to disarm .
their ceasefires have been shallow at best and murderous at worst yet all we hear about is the ira .
they too need to give up the gun but again , parity of esteem please .
phil , usa as a resident of northern ireland and a supporter of the peace process since its inception , i have to say i am sad that trimble has had to resign but i am more confident about the prospects for true democracy now that he has .
we all want peace , but the price of allowing armed terrorists to stay in government is too high .
this is about more that northern ireland , this is a principled stand for democracy .
i am thankful that we have a man of integrity like trimble prepared to risk all for true peace .
stewart , antrim why do n't the loyalist and the republican paramilitaries hand in gun for gun and whilst we are at it why do n't the police restrict the issue of " legally held " guns , 85 % of which are in the hands of loyalist supporters .
gerry , scotland this may be the reason the troubles have lasted so long neill whillans , the current peace process has been always been one-sided , in favour of sf / ira and david trimble , finally , is trying redress the issue .
irish republicans always state that they have never " surrendered " arms , as a justification for not doing so now .
did they ever stop and wonder that this may be the reason the troubles have lasted so long ?
a commitment to peace should n't require illegal arms to be held back , just in case .
neill whillans , the netherlands -lrb- formerly belfast -rrb- i 'm really depressed after reading some of the comments in this forum .
there 's lots of blame being apportioned .
the deep seated distrust felt by both sides of the divide in northern ireland seems more prevalent now than at any point in the last few years - witness the electoral success of both sinn fein and the dup .
republicans say " we ca n't expect the ira to decommission - its a matter of principle " .
unionists say " we must be allowed to march in drumcree - it 's a matter of principle " .
what northern ireland needs now is less principle and more pragmatism .
john , uk too much emphasis is placed on decommissioning arms .
what else have the detractors from peace talked about since the agreement ?
what else would they have to talk about after it .
even after they do , ian paisley would find some other reason to avoid " peace " and prolong his hold on unionist sentiment .
fergus porter , australia there is only one viable and sustainable long term solution for the north of ireland : reconciliation and re-unification .
trimble deserved to have his bluff called .
his problem is that he has to deal with small-minded , intractable bigots in the uu party , whose heads are firmly in the sand , and the past , and it is time they were seen as such .
the irish republic is no longer the it once was .
it is a vibrant , young , prosperous and self-confident country that is a pleasure to visit .
indeed , the contrast between the republic and the grim , stubborn , old and downright boring society that is ulster protestantism could not be greater .
the people of the north of ireland have nothing to fear from re-unification - only the trouble-making politicians do .
sooner or later they must wake up to the fact that time and tide are against them .
ulster has remained as it is only due to the foolhardiness of successive british governments .
it is high time we stopped wasting the british taxpayers ' money maintaining this archaic relic of history .
jeremy , england let us live in the real world for a moment , and not the hair-splitting semantics of adams etc al , or the vitriol and bigotry of paisley .
for the good friday agreement to have a chance then there must be an unambiguous " intention " by the ira to put weapons beyond use .
this does not currently exist .
mick , uk there should be another referendum in ni .
the question should be " should the ira and other terrorist organisations decommission now " ?
would sinn fein be able to explain then why the ira wo n't comply with the voice of the people ?
neil , wales over 30 years of hatred , finger-pointing and bigotry perpetuates itself , and david trimble 's resignation and the reaction of both " republican " and " unionist " community leaders highlights that .
the sad thing that the gerry adams " wrapped in a tricolour " and ian paisleys " wrapped in a union jack " do n't get the point .
neither mainland britain or the republic of ireland wants you until you can live peacefully with your neighbours irrespective of your differences .
that is a minimum requirement for a normal civilised society and apartheid divided schools , neighbourhoods and lives in northern ireland are a sad testament to that and the abject failure of all its political leaders to deliver .
jack , dublin , ireland i believe that mr trimble 's resignation has been a decision for him that has been a difficult one to come by bruce , usa i believe that mr trimble 's resignation has been a decision for him that has been a difficult one to come by .
anyone who has been interested in the peace process has had to look at this man as a leader in the process .
whether or not you agree totally with his views , he has been there for all who are actually involved .
how can a man get anywhere when working with political partners who come directly from a terrorist organisation and claim to have no influence on that same organisation , i.e. sinn fein / ira ?
bruce , usa politicians and people on both sides have to live with the reality that the good friday agreement is imperfect and flawed .
still , it 's a lot more attractive than the alternatives .
everyone needs to grow up and realise that they might be about to throw away the best thing that ever happened to northern ireland .
andy , uk of course mr trimble had no choice but to resign .
he knows perfectly well that he has lost the support of the unionist people in n. ireland , even those who voted for the agreement in the first place .
the ira and sinn fein have made fools of the british and irish governments , the american government and everyone else who urged this one-sided agreement from the beginning .
e. davison , ulster trimble needed to resign p. baker , ireland yes , trimble needed to resign .
he had painted himself into a corner with his own party and had nowhere left to go .
his ultimatum allowed him to exit without losing face .
the problem now is who replaces him as leader of the ulster unionist party ?
p. baker , ireland since the start of the good friday agreement there sinn fein / ira have taken everything and given nothing in return .
they have had prisoners released , military bases closed down , troops scaled down , reforms in policing .
what have they given in return ?
absolutely nothing - not even one bullet as a token gesture .
yet they still want more .
until they realise that the peace process is a 2-way thing - with give and take on both sides - the situation will be never be resolved steve , uk mr trimble has my sympathy , he has been banging his head against a brick wall .
it seems that whatever relaxation by the government , the ira will never decommission their arms .
i can not see the talks being very productive .
ian , england in 1998 , just before the referendum , i sent the following to a " talking point " today , more that three years later , nothing has changed .
" the problem with this agreement is that once again sinn fein / ira are being allowed to weasel out of giving up their weapons of mass murder .
sf / ira was supposed to give up their weapons before being admitted to the talks .
they were then supposed to give up their weapons during the talks .
they are now encouraged to give up their weapons some two years after the end of the talks .
they have said that they are not going to give up their weapons at all .
what is to stop sf from not fulfilling this requirement by denying that they and the ira are one or by having members of the ira regroup with the same weapons under a different name ? "
alan murphy , usa the whole arms issue has always been nothing more than an excuse john , australia the ira made no commitment to disarm by any particular date .
the ira has been on ceasefire for over 5 years now .
the only paramilitaries using their guns in the interim have been loyalist .
no loyalist paramilitaries have allowed access to their weapons for verification that they are not being used .
even if the ira handed in all their weapons / explosives they could still buy more .
the whole arms issue has always been nothing more than an excuse for unionists who are anti-agreement to delay , impede , wreck the good friday agreement .
john , australia the british govermnet has " caved in " to ira demands before and they will again christopher porritt , uk the only way forward now for the uk government is more spineless appeasement of the ira : all parties in northern ireland will be told that they will just have to accept that the ira will never give up their arms .
the british government has " caved in " to ira demands before and they will again .
christopher porritt , uk mr trimble should not have resigned .
i really ca n't understand why he gives so much importance to the ira 's decommissioning : arms can be destroyed , but can also easily be bought again !
moreover , the ira has been quiet for a long time .
the point is whether the unionists want the belfast agreement , and the peace process , to survive .
it seems to me that they do n't .
raffaella , italy trimble is a brilliant tactician david cunningham , germany i have long been a supporter of david trimble a man who represents modern , forward thinking unionism and who has , over the last three years , worked so hard to create an inclusive northern ireland which is not a " cold house " for people of the nationalist tradition .
in his resignation i have to support him , too .
after three years it can no longer be acceptable that one party in a four-party-government has an armed private army .
but david trimble is a brilliant tactician and who knows what the next six weeks will bring .
don Â´ t give up hope !
david cunningham , germany the ira / sinn fein always harp on about being on ceasefire , if this is a permanent ceasefire then they have no need for arms and should have no trouble surrendering them .
if they are reluctant to do this then one can only assume that they do n't believe the ceasefire to be permanent .
i am not a trimble supporter and only fear his resignation is a sham .

kieran mccartan , n. ireland we have to compromise if this situation is ever going to be resolved john , usa do we really believe for one minute that the arms dumps that the ira has shown to the arms inspectors are only ones they have or that they even contain their most modern weapons ?
i do n't think so .
if that is the case , why do n't they just hand over those weapons for destruction as a gesture of good faith .
it 's time for all sides to give up something .
we ca n't have everything we want in life .
it 's not a perfect world .
we have to compromise if this situation is ever going to be resolved .
john , usa i used to follow the situation in ni intently , being a descendant of an ulster-scot born in belfast in the 1740s .
but i 'm frankly bored with it now .
it 's all re-runs .
no wonder my ancestor left .
thank god he did .
roy , usa the only way to end all this is to show beyond a doubt that the political solution works .
trimble 's resignation gives evidence that it does not work .
krow , usa the royal ulster constabulary recently showed itself unable to protect children on their way to school from violence .
will this sectarian outfit be able to keep order on july 12th ?
g , usa the issue of the gun and the violence today is more from the unionist community and the continued sectarian attacks .
if there is a group that needs to disarm it is the loyalist paramilitary groups first .
the republican side does need to turn over all explosives , because these are the real indiscriminate killers .
they should retain the rifles and pistols as a matter of self-defence against bigoted attacks .
every man , woman or child has the right to self-defence and self-determination .
the sectarian violence must end and that people must learn to respect the differences in religion before there can be peace .
keith , usa there should be another referendum in northern ireland , asking the question " what should be the fate of northern ireland ?
a. join the republic of ireland .
b. form an independent northern ireland , free of both the republic of ireland and the united kingdom . "
the option to remain part of the united kingdom should not appear on the ballot , because it 's obvious that that option has n't worked and is not going to .
voting on this issue ought to be compulsory , in order to get the clearest possible view of how people in northern ireland feel about their own fate .
a. , usa can someone explain to me why no one is questioning the refusal of the loyalist paramilitary groups to disarm .
their ceasefires have been shallow at best and murderous at worst yet all we hear about is the ira .
they too need to give up the gun but again , parity of esteem please .
phil , usa as a resident of northern ireland and a supporter of the peace process since its inception , i have to say i am sad that trimble has had to resign but i am more confident about the prospects for true democracy now that he has .
we all want peace , but the price of allowing armed terrorists to stay in government is too high .
this is about more that northern ireland , this is a principled stand for democracy .
i am thankful that we have a man of integrity like trimble prepared to risk all for true peace .
stewart , antrim why do n't the loyalist and the republican paramilitaries hand in gun for gun and whilst we are at it why do n't the police restrict the issue of " legally held " guns , 85 % of which are in the hands of loyalist supporters .
gerry , scotland this may be the reason the troubles have lasted so long neill whillans , the current peace process has been always been one-sided , in favour of sf / ira and david trimble , finally , is trying redress the issue .
irish republicans always state that they have never " surrendered " arms , as a justification for not doing so now .
did they ever stop and wonder that this may be the reason the troubles have lasted so long ?
a commitment to peace should n't require illegal arms to be held back , just in case .
neill whillans , the netherlands -lrb- formerly belfast -rrb- i 'm really depressed after reading some of the comments in this forum .
there 's lots of blame being apportioned .
the deep seated distrust felt by both sides of the divide in northern ireland seems more prevalent now than at any point in the last few years - witness the electoral success of both sinn fein and the dup .
republicans say " we ca n't expect the ira to decommission - its a matter of principle " .
unionists say " we must be allowed to march in drumcree - it 's a matter of principle " .
what northern ireland needs now is less principle and more pragmatism .
john , uk too much emphasis is placed on decommissioning arms .
what else have the detractors from peace talked about since the agreement ?
what else would they have to talk about after it .
even after they do , ian paisley would find some other reason to avoid " peace " and prolong his hold on unionist sentiment .
fergus porter , australia there is only one viable and sustainable long term solution for the north of ireland : reconciliation and re-unification .
trimble deserved to have his bluff called .
his problem is that he has to deal with small-minded , intractable bigots in the uu party , whose heads are firmly in the sand , and the past , and it is time they were seen as such .
the irish republic is no longer the it once was .
it is a vibrant , young , prosperous and self-confident country that is a pleasure to visit .
indeed , the contrast between the republic and the grim , stubborn , old and downright boring society that is ulster protestantism could not be greater .
the people of the north of ireland have nothing to fear from re-unification - only the trouble-making politicians do .
sooner or later they must wake up to the fact that time and tide are against them .
ulster has remained as it is only due to the foolhardiness of successive british governments .
it is high time we stopped wasting the british taxpayers ' money maintaining this archaic relic of history .
jeremy , england let us live in the real world for a moment , and not the hair-splitting semantics of adams etc al , or the vitriol and bigotry of paisley .
for the good friday agreement to have a chance then there must be an unambiguous " intention " by the ira to put weapons beyond use .
this does not currently exist .
mick , uk there should be another referendum in ni .
the question should be " should the ira and other terrorist organisations decommission now " ?
would sinn fein be able to explain then why the ira wo n't comply with the voice of the people ?
neil , wales over 30 years of hatred , finger-pointing and bigotry perpetuates itself , and david trimble 's resignation and the reaction of both " republican " and " unionist " community leaders highlights that .
the sad thing that the gerry adams " wrapped in a tricolour " and ian paisleys " wrapped in a union jack " do n't get the point .
neither mainland britain or the republic of ireland wants you until you can live peacefully with your neighbours irrespective of your differences .
that is a minimum requirement for a normal civilised society and apartheid divided schools , neighbourhoods and lives in northern ireland are a sad testament to that and the abject failure of all its political leaders to deliver .
jack , dublin , ireland i believe that mr trimble 's resignation has been a decision for him that has been a difficult one to come by bruce , usa i believe that mr trimble 's resignation has been a decision for him that has been a difficult one to come by .
anyone who has been interested in the peace process has had to look at this man as a leader in the process .
whether or not you agree totally with his views , he has been there for all who are actually involved .
how can a man get anywhere when working with political partners who come directly from a terrorist organisation and claim to have no influence on that same organisation , i.e. sinn fein / ira ?
bruce , usa politicians and people on both sides have to live with the reality that the good friday agreement is imperfect and flawed .
still , it 's a lot more attractive than the alternatives .
everyone needs to grow up and realise that they might be about to throw away the best thing that ever happened to northern ireland .
andy , uk of course mr trimble had no choice but to resign .
he knows perfectly well that he has lost the support of the unionist people in n. ireland , even those who voted for the agreement in the first place .
the ira and sinn fein have made fools of the british and irish governments , the american government and everyone else who urged this one-sided agreement from the beginning .
e. davison , ulster trimble needed to resign p. baker , ireland yes , trimble needed to resign .
he had painted himself into a corner with his own party and had nowhere left to go .
his ultimatum allowed him to exit without losing face .
the problem now is who replaces him as leader of the ulster unionist party ?
p. baker , ireland since the start of the good friday agreement there sinn fein / ira have taken everything and given nothing in return .
they have had prisoners released , military bases closed down , troops scaled down , reforms in policing .
what have they given in return ?
absolutely nothing - not even one bullet as a token gesture .
yet they still want more .
until they realise that the peace process is a 2-way thing - with give and take on both sides - the situation will be never be resolved steve , uk mr trimble has my sympathy , he has been banging his head against a brick wall .
it seems that whatever relaxation by the government , the ira will never decommission their arms .
i can not see the talks being very productive .
ian , england in 1998 , just before the referendum , i sent the following to a " talking point " today , more that three years later , nothing has changed .
" the problem with this agreement is that once again sinn fein / ira are being allowed to weasel out of giving up their weapons of mass murder .
sf / ira was supposed to give up their weapons before being admitted to the talks .
they were then supposed to give up their weapons during the talks .
they are now encouraged to give up their weapons some two years after the end of the talks .
they have said that they are not going to give up their weapons at all .
what is to stop sf from not fulfilling this requirement by denying that they and the ira are one or by having members of the ira regroup with the same weapons under a different name ? "
alan murphy , usa the whole arms issue has always been nothing more than an excuse john , australia the ira made no commitment to disarm by any particular date .
the ira has been on ceasefire for over 5 years now .
the only paramilitaries using their guns in the interim have been loyalist .
no loyalist paramilitaries have allowed access to their weapons for verification that they are not being used .
even if the ira handed in all their weapons / explosives they could still buy more .
the whole arms issue has always been nothing more than an excuse for unionists who are anti-agreement to delay , impede , wreck the good friday agreement .
john , australia the british govermnet has " caved in " to ira demands before and they will again christopher porritt , uk the only way forward now for the uk government is more spineless appeasement of the ira : all parties in northern ireland will be told that they will just have to accept that the ira will never give up their arms .
the british government has " caved in " to ira demands before and they will again .
christopher porritt , uk mr trimble should not have resigned .
i really ca n't understand why he gives so much importance to the ira 's decommissioning : arms can be destroyed , but can also easily be bought again !
moreover , the ira has been quiet for a long time .
the point is whether the unionists want the belfast agreement , and the peace process , to survive .
it seems to me that they do n't .
raffaella , italy trimble is a brilliant tactician david cunningham , germany i have long been a supporter of david trimble a man who represents modern , forward thinking unionism and who has , over the last three years , worked so hard to create an inclusive northern ireland which is not a " cold house " for people of the nationalist tradition .
in his resignation i have to support him , too .
after three years it can no longer be acceptable that one party in a four-party-government has an armed private army .
but david trimble is a brilliant tactician and who knows what the next six weeks will bring .
don Â´ t give up hope !
david cunningham , germany the ira / sinn fein always harp on about being on ceasefire , if this is a permanent ceasefire then they have no need for arms and should have no trouble surrendering them .
if they are reluctant to do this then one can only assume that they do n't believe the ceasefire to be permanent .
i am not a trimble supporter and only fear his resignation is a sham .

mot-style medical checks are set to be introduced for disabled people drawing incapacity benefit .
campaigners are shocked and disappointed by plans to re-assess all but the most severely disabled claimants every three years , to see if they 're fit to work .
the works and pensions secretary , alistair darling , believes as many as 70 % of the 2.3 million people claiming incapacity benefit could return to work .
darling believes there should be a three-year limit to the benefit and also work-based interviews to test suitability for employment .
should incapacity benefit be regularly re-assessed in this way ?
is it an insult to the disabled or a common-sense requirement ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction there could very easily be a system whereby people with permanent conditions were registered as such and were never required to pass a " disability means test " beyond that accompanying their initial registration .
people with non-permanent conditions could similarly be registered but have , as a condition of their benefit award , a periodic re-evaluation .
this seems perfectly reasonable and would more efficiently target possible fraud .
bs mcintosh , sweden -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- if the medical was to take place as often as six-monthly i could see some reason to argue .
but a three yearly medical sounds more than reasonable to me .
the truly disabled have nothing to fear .
fay , uk sounds like a bit of a blunt instrument to me john , uk sounds like a bit of a blunt instrument to me - i guess we need some common sense .
people with ms , missing limbs etc. are n't suddenly going to be " cured " so a 3 yearly assessment might be inappropriate .
equally , a 3 yearly check-up is unlikely to deter the determined fraudster .
if i were a teacher , i 'd have to say " darling has tried hard on this project , and the overall standard of his work is good , but he needs to focus more on the detail " . "
john , uk as long as the system is set up correctly , those who are genuinely unable to work will not have a problem .
those who are abusing the system will be found out .
it may also be possible for a lot of housebound disabled people to work from home , giving them a sense of accomplishment .
diane coleman , uk yes i will have a three-year check up .
i think all taxpayers ' money should be paid out to genuine claimants .
i also want 3 year checkups on westminster mps as they could teach us all about fraud , and as for the euro mps a yearly check will be needed as the emp who claimed Â£ 1,100 for a sit on lawn mower while he lived in a eleventh floor flat springs to mind .
j. o 'donnell , england i have been unable to work for over six years due to a back injury .
i have always claimed incapacity benefit .
i have had a medical to assess my problem every three years , in the beginning i had about four medicals in eighteen months .
i accept that the are people who take advantage of the system , and it is always the people who are really disabled that have to suffer .
i am prepared to be checked every 3 years , if this will help to get rid of the spongers .
ian , england i 'm all for social programs and essential benefits for those who genuinely require them but i do n't see why the state should give handouts without undertaking checks to ensure that the taxpayer is n't being fleeced .
most people work hard and contribute generously in tax compared to the us and canada and it strikes me as only right and proper that tony blair as steward of taxpayers ' money ensures that it is spent wisely .
not checking on possible benefit fraud is the same as not having company accounts audited , which is unthinkable .
tony - stand firm against the left on this issue .
ian jones , canada yes , they should be checked regularly .
doctors should be able to put forward recommendations in extreme cases of disability that such people will be unfit to do whatever types of work their disability dictates and thus exempt them from further inspections .
however , the man with the aching back , who wants to avoid the world of work for the rest of his life , should receive regular checks rory mcknight , uk a friend of mine can barely walk due to disability , but works full time .
my father has worsening arthritis and a condition related to me , but works part time .
why should others , with lesser conditions , not work also ?
i completely agree with the government on this one , if someone can work at all , then they should do so .
the shirkers have had it easy since the benefit system was introduced and the work ethic died out .
ella , uk my father has a full time job in london and commutes from essex every day .
although he is blind , diabetic and epileptic he is still able to work a full week .
he is entitled to disability benefit and i 'm sure he will be one of the exceptions to the 3 year rule .
however , there is someone else we know who is registered disabled due to an injury he sustained to his back at work and although he claims disability benefit because he can not work he often goes fishing for long periods of time and does all the shopping -lrb- even carrying the week 's groceries in one go -rrb- .
he claims his disability is so severe that he is entitled to a mobility car , which my father is not .
there is obviously something wrong with the current system and i know my father and many of the disabled people he works with , would not have a problem with attending a medical every 3 years if necessary .
after all , it is only those who are fraudulently claiming benefit that will have something to worry about !
karen , england benefits claims should definitely be investigated .
genuine claims should n't worry - then at least the taxpayer would n't be footing the bill for lazy , greedy people .
nicole smith , uk for genuine benefit claimants , regular reviews / testing is nothing to worry about - particularly as the government are suggesting a three year review period .
for many people , incapacity is not a permanent state but a response to major illness / accident .
i would like to see the government put more resources into occupational therapy to provide real assistance to those who have been absent from the workplace for extended periods .
also , where people are incapacitated through mental health problems , the government should work with the charitable sector to provide meaningful and supportive assistance while people are signed off rather than leaving vulnerable , and often isolated people , unchecked and unmonitored .
sophie hargreaves , uk only those who are not eligible for the funds will be afraid of this move .
every taxpayer has the right to expect accountability for their money , including that which goes to disability collectors .
for those who say it would cost a lot or overburden the doctors , this is completely untrue .
you 're paying much more in fraud then you ever will in tri-annual check ups and if someone is so disabled that they ca n't do work of any kind or sort , then they 're seeing the doctor on a regular basis anyway , are n't they ?
in response to those who say they 'd like to work but ca n't find a part time job that allows them flexibility , why not give back to the community that supports you ?
why not volunteer at your local hospital , school or city council for those two or three hours a day , two or three days a week ?
many posters at bbc online have said time and again that there is a shortage of personnel at churches , schools and hospitals .
linda , usa i have been disabled from birth and my disability is not insignificant .
however , i work full time and pay my income tax each month and am proud to do so .
i know many disabled people who could do the same but -lrb- some who are not even as severely disabled as i am -rrb- but refuse to do so because it would mean giving up benefits .
this should not be permitted .
there does need to be some checking therefore to ensure that only those truly in need receive the appropriate benefits provided that those checks take all factors into account that are relevant to the individual .
i am all for helping those who genuinely need it but if people can contribute to the nation then this should be encouraged .
what better way is there to improve the image and status of disabled people in society .
bryn , uk here we go again no sooner does the government start looking a welfare reform than people are up in arms about it .
this is seven billion pounds of taxpayers ' money going on benefit claims most of which are deserved and genuine , but as with any universal benefits system it can and is open to abuse .
a benefit is a support ; a means to an end and not a way of life and the current law actively discourages people from moving away from welfare into work ; and without checks even more so especially if you are not a genuine claimant .
i 'm sure many working disabled people who have taken advantaged of adaptation technology in the workplace and training into new job opportunities must be dismayed at how the word disability is utilised like a preventative barrier , a no go subject for fear of offending the afflicted .
simon griffiths , uk my wife has been on incapacity benefit for two years and there is no way she can ever realistically go back to work p. haines , uk my wife has been on incapacity benefit for two years and there is no way she can ever realistically go back to work .
she recently went through the ' points ' scoring medical test referred to above .
the medical was rushed and unprofessional .
the report completed by the doctor was inaccurate and ignored specialist medical opinion .
she finally won her appeal after much heartache and a tremendous amount of work which we had to carry out ourselves .
the process left my wife totally debilitated .
neither of us object to a regular process to verify that my wife is unable to work .
we do object to the unprofessional way the process is currently carried out .
p. haines , uk if you 're a genuine claimant , then what 's the problem ?
i have a disability , but still manage to work .
i get checks whether i can still get my disability living allowance , so why ca n't people on this get them as well ?
if you 're genuinely disabled , then what 's the problem ? ? ? ?
tommy atherton , scotland i worked for us social security during the reagan years when a very similar scheme was implemented .
all disabled recipients were reviewed and approximately two thirds were cut off .
the implications of this were brought to the attention of the press when several cut off folks shot themselves in social security offices .
it turned out that only about 10 % of those cut off as " able to work " ever found a job .
most were put up by relatives but approximately 100,000 became homeless ; living on the streets and such .
we ended up reinstating most -lrb- at great expense -rrb- .
there is still a periodic " review " but the standard requires " medical improvement " so few are actually cut off .
the latest development is a plan to identify those who are likely to be cut off and " push " them to get jobs first ; before they are cut off .
dave , usa the only people we should all contribute towards supporting are the disabled and the elderly mark hill , england the only people we should all contribute towards supporting are the disabled and the elderly .
let 's give them more by scrapping the welfare system where we pay someone to sit on their backside all day - unemployment benefit .
this was only ever meant to serve as a stop gap following the second world war .
mark hill , england i have been on incapacity benefit in the past and eventually made a recovery and returned to work .
during this period i visited my doctor periodically for a new medical certificate that was submitted to ensure that my claim was paid .
surely if people are regularly assessed by their doctor who has a far more in depth knowledge of their condition then why introduce another layer of bureaucracy and cost ?
if the person concerned is going to be signed off permanently then this may well be a case for review at the time of signing off .
robert , uk rather than taking yet another pop at people claiming icb , why not deal with the " causes " of incapacity ?
more and more workers suffer high stress levels and poor health and safety in our workplaces .
if the government really want more people in work , they should address these problems !
ben drake , york , uk there should n't be benefits for life neil , uk of course they should be .
people 's circumstances change all the time .
there should n't be benefits for life , for anyone in society .
my wife work in social services where she has to assess elderly care every 6 months .
if the people need it , they will get it .
neil , uk a means testing system might be all right if the aim of it was to do what they say they want to .
however i think the real reason for doing this is to shave off some of the claimants in order to cut social services spending , the result of which will be to send people to work who are not really fit for it .
i think the people who are sent out to look for work will be able to do jobs to some extent but the quality and possibly the length of their lives will suffer as a result .
dave , sweden at present i am required to go for a medical examination about every three years .
when i attend the doctors complain that they are overworked and ca n't cope .
they say that they are paid a fixed sum for each examination and most of the questions in the 60 page form are irrational and a waste of time ; in short they ca n't cope .
do the government have in mind " releasing " doctors from the arduous task and instead using " specially trained personnel " , in other words office staff , to decide who should live and who should die from being forced to work when they are ill ?
robert , uk ok , so there are some kinds of disability that preclude all kinds of work , but some people could work at something , though not necessarily their original trade .
i know one person who wo n't even try to find work because the benefit is available and it would be more of a struggle to cope on low pay .
i 'm sure he 's not alone .
lee , uk certainly there should be means testing .
not every case is clear cut , and there are those in this world who will insist on getting more than their fair share and deprive others more deserving .
i have worked for an insurance company and seen many bogus disability claims .
in the long run the people that truly deserve allowances will benefit from improvements in the service .
rob , uk unless someone has something to hide , i can see no reason why they should object to a three-yearly medical .
steven baker , uk i used to represent claimants in incapacity benefit cases before social security tribunals .
i did n't come across a single case that would n't benefit from the three-year rule , which i regard as still too generous .
bilal patel , london unless someone has something to hide , i can see no reason why they should object to a three-yearly medical .
steven baker , uk i am of two minds about this .
on the one hand it appears unchristian and uncaring , whilst on the other i am aware of some people much more able-bodied than i who are claiming incapacity benefit whilst i am able to earn my living without recourse to benefits .
if checks are to be carried out every three years , then i believe they must be rigorous enough to filter out the workshy but must take care not to disadvantage those who , because of communication impairments , are unable to justify benefits which they genuinely need and should be entitled to .
steve , england instead of picking on the disabled , how about putting car drivers through an ' mot ' every three years .
traffic congestion would be sorted at a stroke , thus saving on road-building .
pressure on a & e departments would be eased which will save the nhs money too .
oops , forgot that all the drivers put off the road that lose their jobs will go onto incapacity benefit !
janet , scotland whilst i can agree with the concept to an extent , i feel that this is a bad plan .
i have seen supposed disabled people who are fit and active , and obviously playing the system - stop this at the start .
make sure that the original assessment is done by a truly unbiased independent doctor .
once this is achieved , leave them alone .
i hate to see people sponging off society , but let 's not go too far the other way , when everything is means tested , and the rules for passing are a moving target -lrb- and this will happen -rrb- designed to save the government money each year at the expense of the people they supposedly represent .
ian , uk this is not so much about saving money but more about getting people to pay tax .
if you are dishonestly on benefits then not only are you costing money directly but , more significantly , you are not paying your share of income tax to cover health / education etc .
gareth houghton , britain of course they should .
i have several friends on long-term benefits and they would have no objection to this .
the only real sense of panic stems from those with something to hide .
bill hamilton , uk most disabled people greatly fear the dss doctors maureen barnes , england no one would object to providing medical evidence of continuing health problems , but most disabled people greatly fear the dss doctors - the system is an unjust shambles - the number of people winning appeals is evidence of this .
maureen barnes , england of course benefits should be regularly checked for fraudulent claims , the rest of us that pay a fair chunk of our wages would like to be sure that it goes to people in real need .
it was never meant as a lifetime meal ticket for someone who was ill but is now ok .
as an example , which i 'm sure most people have seen themselves , i went walking in the lake district last august , and as usual the car parks were full , unless of course you had a coveted ' orange badge ' .
in drives a man in his fifties , straight into one of the disabled slots .
i was even more annoyed when he set his badge in view before striding off into the distance .
when i left the area two hours later he was still away walking , not bad for a disabled person .
no one begrudges a penny to genuine claimants , but those of us who fund the system would like to be sure that the money is being properly targeted .
stephen owen , england i 'm all against means-tested benefits , people should be given the benefit of the doubt .
bob , uk yes , of course .
all welfare benefits should be means tested to ensure that the benefit goes only to those in most need .
unfortunately in britain " means testing " is a dirty phrase , whereas in scandinavia and the rest of mainland europe is it a simple administrative measure which all recognise as necessary for a fair distribution .
patrick fidler , ireland i think it would be a good idea to wheedle out the fraudsters and make them do a decent , honest days work for a change sonia , england my mum is on benefits because she has severe arthritis of the coccyx , spine and it is spreading rapidly through her body .
she has been told she will never work again because this disease will eventually completely rob her of her mobility .
however , a man who lives up the road from her is also on benefit , has a mobility car and has had a stair lift fitted free of charge and there is nothing wrong with him .
at weekends he can be seen digging his garden .
his back is obviously not that bad because as soon as the chair lift was fitted he decided he do n't need it and de-installed it himself , those things are n't exactly lightweight .
i think it would be a good idea to wheedle out the fraudsters and make them do a decent , honest days work for a change as long as those who are in genuine need of benefit are not penalised .
sonia , england if we , as a society , do n't want " means testing " then we , as a society should be honest - be it benefits , tax or whatever .
neil , uk i believe there should be some for of re-evaluation of claims .
i am aware of several people who are simply not disabled , but by using a friendly doctor can be in a situation whereby they work all their life and then the following day are registered disabled and qualify for benefits , orange badges etc .
there should be a periodic independent review of all people claiming benefits .
the review period could be dependent on the age of the claimant with elderly claimants being checked every 5 years and with annual checks for younger claimants .
david gregory , uk i feel that annual checks is the minimum the tax paying public should expect .
after all , we are the people who are paying this .
when either the wife or husband is disabled i see no reason why the partner should not be required to go out and work .
both me and my husband work hard and it saddens me to think that any of are hard earned taxes are being wasted .
amy morley , uk not only should there be some form of check but it should be random and at short notice karl peters , uk not only should there be some form of check but it should be random and at short notice .
while i was claiming unemployment benefits some years ago i was usually given three weeks ' notice of an interview at the job centre .
three weeks is plenty time to prepare for an unscheduled hour or two away from work , for those so inclined .
if notice periods are brief , the genuine claimants will still be able to attend but the fraudsters will have more problems .
consideration should also be made of what jobs can be done by a disabled person - nowadays there is no reason why a disability which previously prevented any form of work should continue to do so -lrb- e.g. a paraplegic it worker -rrb- .
karl peters , uk i do worry that we are heading slowly for the situation in many parts of the usa where people can receive benefits for a limited time only and then are on their own no matter how unable they are to fend for themselves .
though it is surely true that some people fraudulently claim incapacity benefit the government needs to think very carefully .
it can not throw partially recovered people back into the workplace only to work for a short while and fall ill again , also if people have been unable to work for several years due to illness who will want to employ them ?
angus gulliver , uk i find this a strange piece of news , as i have been on incapacity benefit for 8 years , and have had to have a medical every year without fail .
every year i fail the test , sometimes by only one point -lrb- the dss use a " game of points " system - less than 15 and you 're out -rrb- then see my doctor who managed to keep me on incapacity benefit .
bruce ruff , uk there is means testing and there is means of testing hazel , uk there is means testing and there is means of testing .
while i acknowledge the fact that there are many idle persons hiding behind a disabled label , having detected them they will then sign on as unemployed , still costing the taxpayer .
what the government can and should do is recognise that there are plenty of disabled persons out there who would rather work , be it part or full time , but can not because there is no suitable work for them , or the premises can not or wo n't be adapted for disabled persons needs , nor are there many industries which will consider home-working unless the person concerned is a valued staff member of long standing .
hazel , uk i do n't see how people can complain about this .
some cases would need to be examined only once as the nature of the injury would prohibit working forever .
in all other cases , people should be able to prove they are just recipients .
only those that are dubious candidates would need to fear .
genuine claimants with genuine conditions should have no fear .
mike , england i 'll say !
an old friend of mine got his foot caught in a drill whilst at work .
he was in hospital for a month and came out on crutches .
now he has a very bad limp , but is classed as disabled and has n't worked for over a year .
he does n't need any support to walk , so what 's to stop him getting on a bus , going to work and sitting at a desk like the rest of us ?
it 's plain lazy , and i resent paying out for those who are basically just blaggers .
david doine , uk firstly , this is not means testing .
so comments on that subject are not relevant .
secondly , i do n't think that having a doctor confirm your claim once every three years is really such a high price for the support of the state , and by extension all the tax payers in the country , do you ?
peter , england i do n't agree with this move .
although it may save some money , it will also cause some genuine recipients to live in fear of the three-yearly re-evaluation .
i believe this is too high a price for the saving .
malcolm cleaton , england there are always those innocent people who end up being treated like criminals m. deal , uk the government is right in principle to tackle the issue of fraudulent claims .
there are a vast amount of claimants who are simply manipulating the system to avoid work .
i have certainly known a few people who have claimed incapacity benefit and yet were as fit as anyone else .
they simply wanted to avoid work .
however , as usual in these cases there are always those innocent people who end up being treated like criminals , and who really are in need of benefit .
yet even a blind person can do some sorts of work and the government should do more to train people with particular disabilities for jobs they could be doing and probably would like to do .
but yes , weed out the fraudsters , protect the genuine , and be ruthless but fair with it .
m. deal , uk i feel the only people who have a right to worry about these plans are those who are claiming when they do n't need to .
steve webster , england yes , all benefit should be means-tested or assessed periodically .
the role of the state is to provide for the poorest and disadvantaged in society - not to provide for all regardless of their ability to pay .
andreas white , united kingdom people are caught in a trap until they are well enough to go back for near normal working hours kevin anderson , uk my wife has been unable to work for nearly 4 years due to illness - although recovering she would even now only be able to work 1-2 hours per day for 2-3 times per week .
employers are unwilling to offer flexible working hours and the pay would not match the benefits lost so people are caught in a trap until they are well enough to go back for near normal working hours .
means testing should only be introduced when there is some way of getting back into work on reduced or flexible hours .
kevin anderson , uk yes they should be tested on a regular basis to see if they can work .
that way people who really need the benefits will get them and people who can work will stop sponging off the country .
i know people on these benefits who are able to work but would rather live off whatever benefits they can get .
this is the sort of thing we can do to target those in need and stop the freeloaders .
martin , yorkshire the reduction in fraudulent benefit claims would free up cash for more deserving , genuine cases cav , uk anybody claiming benefit -lrb- of any kind -rrb- should be subject to regular or perhaps random checks .
i see no harm in this at all .
the reduction in fraudulent benefit claims would free up ' cash ' for more deserving , genuine cases .
careful steps should be taken to avoid heavy pressure on people with a disability that are rightfully receiving benefit , who may think that the awards are ' not worth the trouble ' or feel belittled by the experience .
equally , too soft a touch would leave hardened benefit fraudsters laughing all the way to the bank .
cav , uk there 's me , thinking that the tories lost the last election .
whatever next - privatisation of the health service and the london underground ?
whatever happened to the third way ?
bob , uk if you have nothing to hide then every 3 years you can prove you should get the benefit .
too many people claim it when they can work .
this method of checking will find out who has been cheating the system and save the taxpayer plenty of money to be used on other areas .
kris , uk i 'm not prepared to let people continue to leech off the state randy , uk as with all benefits relating to the ability or otherwise to work , there are those amongst the claimants who choose to abuse the system , cultivate the help of gullible , over-stretched doctors , and who also earn in the black economy .
i know of one .
many others will be known to their friends and families .
i 'm not prepared to let such people continue to leech off the state .
true disability is another thing , but to assess claimants ' qualification for benefit can not be written off as harassment or needlessly causing distress .
it has to be done to ensure the benefit gets to the deserving .
remember , the more fraudulent claimants there are , the less there is to go round for the genuine cases and the rest of society .
it comes from our pockets through taxation and should be taken seriously , not just given away when demanded .
randy , uk exactly how much will this means testing add to the total bill for this benefit ?
this is the question which must be answered before we even begin to ask whether it is morally right to means -lrb- or should that be mean ? -rrb- test disabled people .
despite the apparent belief of government ministers that bureaucracy comes free of charge , it does n't .
the army of civil servants and hangers-on who would be needed to administer these checks would surely more than negate the savings achieved by being so penny-pinching .
david hazel , uk why not ?
a check up every 3 years in return for ongoing benefit seems a tiny inconvenience for someone with a genuine problem .
also technology is changing , bringing opportunities to those to work , who could not do so before .
and , let 's face it , there is a lot of fraud going on .
i can only think of one person i knew on permanent invalidity benefit .
he was paid because his eyesight was too poor for him to work .
oddly , his eyesight was fine for driving .
andyc , uk this will end up just like the child support agency andrew whiteside , uk this will end up just like the child support agency , by penalising the honest and genuine but not tackling the fraudster , who will always find a way around the system .
time to think again , mr darling .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- should disability be continually put to the test ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo the works and pensions secretary , alistair darling " you do have an obligation to work , if you can do so " real 28k deputy director ippr , lisa harker " we have yet to see full employment across society " real 28k liberal democratic mp , steve webb " i think it 's predominately cost-cutting , dressed up " real 28k monday , 9 july , 2001 , 07:39 gmt 08:39 uk should disability be continually put to the test ?
mot-style medical checks are set to be introduced for disabled people drawing incapacity benefit .
campaigners are shocked and disappointed by plans to re-assess all but the most severely disabled claimants every three years , to see if they 're fit to work .
the works and pensions secretary , alistair darling , believes as many as 70 % of the 2.3 million people claiming incapacity benefit could return to work .
darling believes there should be a three-year limit to the benefit and also work-based interviews to test suitability for employment .
should incapacity benefit be regularly re-assessed in this way ?
is it an insult to the disabled or a common-sense requirement ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction there could very easily be a system whereby people with permanent conditions were registered as such and were never required to pass a " disability means test " beyond that accompanying their initial registration .
people with non-permanent conditions could similarly be registered but have , as a condition of their benefit award , a periodic re-evaluation .
this seems perfectly reasonable and would more efficiently target possible fraud .
bs mcintosh , sweden -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- if the medical was to take place as often as six-monthly i could see some reason to argue .
but a three yearly medical sounds more than reasonable to me .
the truly disabled have nothing to fear .
fay , uk sounds like a bit of a blunt instrument to me john , uk sounds like a bit of a blunt instrument to me - i guess we need some common sense .
people with ms , missing limbs etc. are n't suddenly going to be " cured " so a 3 yearly assessment might be inappropriate .
equally , a 3 yearly check-up is unlikely to deter the determined fraudster .
if i were a teacher , i 'd have to say " darling has tried hard on this project , and the overall standard of his work is good , but he needs to focus more on the detail " . "
john , uk as long as the system is set up correctly , those who are genuinely unable to work will not have a problem .
those who are abusing the system will be found out .
it may also be possible for a lot of housebound disabled people to work from home , giving them a sense of accomplishment .
diane coleman , uk yes i will have a three-year check up .
i think all taxpayers ' money should be paid out to genuine claimants .
i also want 3 year checkups on westminster mps as they could teach us all about fraud , and as for the euro mps a yearly check will be needed as the emp who claimed Â£ 1,100 for a sit on lawn mower while he lived in a eleventh floor flat springs to mind .
j. o 'donnell , england i have been unable to work for over six years due to a back injury .
i have always claimed incapacity benefit .
i have had a medical to assess my problem every three years , in the beginning i had about four medicals in eighteen months .
i accept that the are people who take advantage of the system , and it is always the people who are really disabled that have to suffer .
i am prepared to be checked every 3 years , if this will help to get rid of the spongers .
ian , england i 'm all for social programs and essential benefits for those who genuinely require them but i do n't see why the state should give handouts without undertaking checks to ensure that the taxpayer is n't being fleeced .
most people work hard and contribute generously in tax compared to the us and canada and it strikes me as only right and proper that tony blair as steward of taxpayers ' money ensures that it is spent wisely .
not checking on possible benefit fraud is the same as not having company accounts audited , which is unthinkable .
tony - stand firm against the left on this issue .
ian jones , canada yes , they should be checked regularly .
doctors should be able to put forward recommendations in extreme cases of disability that such people will be unfit to do whatever types of work their disability dictates and thus exempt them from further inspections .
however , the man with the aching back , who wants to avoid the world of work for the rest of his life , should receive regular checks rory mcknight , uk a friend of mine can barely walk due to disability , but works full time .
my father has worsening arthritis and a condition related to me , but works part time .
why should others , with lesser conditions , not work also ?
i completely agree with the government on this one , if someone can work at all , then they should do so .
the shirkers have had it easy since the benefit system was introduced and the work ethic died out .
ella , uk my father has a full time job in london and commutes from essex every day .
although he is blind , diabetic and epileptic he is still able to work a full week .
he is entitled to disability benefit and i 'm sure he will be one of the exceptions to the 3 year rule .
however , there is someone else we know who is registered disabled due to an injury he sustained to his back at work and although he claims disability benefit because he can not work he often goes fishing for long periods of time and does all the shopping -lrb- even carrying the week 's groceries in one go -rrb- .
he claims his disability is so severe that he is entitled to a mobility car , which my father is not .
there is obviously something wrong with the current system and i know my father and many of the disabled people he works with , would not have a problem with attending a medical every 3 years if necessary .
after all , it is only those who are fraudulently claiming benefit that will have something to worry about !
karen , england benefits claims should definitely be investigated .
genuine claims should n't worry - then at least the taxpayer would n't be footing the bill for lazy , greedy people .
nicole smith , uk for genuine benefit claimants , regular reviews / testing is nothing to worry about - particularly as the government are suggesting a three year review period .
for many people , incapacity is not a permanent state but a response to major illness / accident .
i would like to see the government put more resources into occupational therapy to provide real assistance to those who have been absent from the workplace for extended periods .
also , where people are incapacitated through mental health problems , the government should work with the charitable sector to provide meaningful and supportive assistance while people are signed off rather than leaving vulnerable , and often isolated people , unchecked and unmonitored .
sophie hargreaves , uk only those who are not eligible for the funds will be afraid of this move .
every taxpayer has the right to expect accountability for their money , including that which goes to disability collectors .
for those who say it would cost a lot or overburden the doctors , this is completely untrue .
you 're paying much more in fraud then you ever will in tri-annual check ups and if someone is so disabled that they ca n't do work of any kind or sort , then they 're seeing the doctor on a regular basis anyway , are n't they ?
in response to those who say they 'd like to work but ca n't find a part time job that allows them flexibility , why not give back to the community that supports you ?
why not volunteer at your local hospital , school or city council for those two or three hours a day , two or three days a week ?
many posters at bbc online have said time and again that there is a shortage of personnel at churches , schools and hospitals .
linda , usa i have been disabled from birth and my disability is not insignificant .
however , i work full time and pay my income tax each month and am proud to do so .
i know many disabled people who could do the same but -lrb- some who are not even as severely disabled as i am -rrb- but refuse to do so because it would mean giving up benefits .
this should not be permitted .
there does need to be some checking therefore to ensure that only those truly in need receive the appropriate benefits provided that those checks take all factors into account that are relevant to the individual .
i am all for helping those who genuinely need it but if people can contribute to the nation then this should be encouraged .
what better way is there to improve the image and status of disabled people in society .
bryn , uk here we go again no sooner does the government start looking a welfare reform than people are up in arms about it .
this is seven billion pounds of taxpayers ' money going on benefit claims most of which are deserved and genuine , but as with any universal benefits system it can and is open to abuse .
a benefit is a support ; a means to an end and not a way of life and the current law actively discourages people from moving away from welfare into work ; and without checks even more so especially if you are not a genuine claimant .
i 'm sure many working disabled people who have taken advantaged of adaptation technology in the workplace and training into new job opportunities must be dismayed at how the word disability is utilised like a preventative barrier , a no go subject for fear of offending the afflicted .
simon griffiths , uk my wife has been on incapacity benefit for two years and there is no way she can ever realistically go back to work p. haines , uk my wife has been on incapacity benefit for two years and there is no way she can ever realistically go back to work .
she recently went through the ' points ' scoring medical test referred to above .
the medical was rushed and unprofessional .
the report completed by the doctor was inaccurate and ignored specialist medical opinion .
she finally won her appeal after much heartache and a tremendous amount of work which we had to carry out ourselves .
the process left my wife totally debilitated .
neither of us object to a regular process to verify that my wife is unable to work .
we do object to the unprofessional way the process is currently carried out .
p. haines , uk if you 're a genuine claimant , then what 's the problem ?
i have a disability , but still manage to work .
i get checks whether i can still get my disability living allowance , so why ca n't people on this get them as well ?
if you 're genuinely disabled , then what 's the problem ? ? ? ?
tommy atherton , scotland i worked for us social security during the reagan years when a very similar scheme was implemented .
all disabled recipients were reviewed and approximately two thirds were cut off .
the implications of this were brought to the attention of the press when several cut off folks shot themselves in social security offices .
it turned out that only about 10 % of those cut off as " able to work " ever found a job .
most were put up by relatives but approximately 100,000 became homeless ; living on the streets and such .
we ended up reinstating most -lrb- at great expense -rrb- .
there is still a periodic " review " but the standard requires " medical improvement " so few are actually cut off .
the latest development is a plan to identify those who are likely to be cut off and " push " them to get jobs first ; before they are cut off .
dave , usa the only people we should all contribute towards supporting are the disabled and the elderly mark hill , england the only people we should all contribute towards supporting are the disabled and the elderly .
let 's give them more by scrapping the welfare system where we pay someone to sit on their backside all day - unemployment benefit .
this was only ever meant to serve as a stop gap following the second world war .
mark hill , england i have been on incapacity benefit in the past and eventually made a recovery and returned to work .
during this period i visited my doctor periodically for a new medical certificate that was submitted to ensure that my claim was paid .
surely if people are regularly assessed by their doctor who has a far more in depth knowledge of their condition then why introduce another layer of bureaucracy and cost ?
if the person concerned is going to be signed off permanently then this may well be a case for review at the time of signing off .
robert , uk rather than taking yet another pop at people claiming icb , why not deal with the " causes " of incapacity ?
more and more workers suffer high stress levels and poor health and safety in our workplaces .
if the government really want more people in work , they should address these problems !
ben drake , york , uk there should n't be benefits for life neil , uk of course they should be .
people 's circumstances change all the time .
there should n't be benefits for life , for anyone in society .
my wife work in social services where she has to assess elderly care every 6 months .
if the people need it , they will get it .
neil , uk a means testing system might be all right if the aim of it was to do what they say they want to .
however i think the real reason for doing this is to shave off some of the claimants in order to cut social services spending , the result of which will be to send people to work who are not really fit for it .
i think the people who are sent out to look for work will be able to do jobs to some extent but the quality and possibly the length of their lives will suffer as a result .
dave , sweden at present i am required to go for a medical examination about every three years .
when i attend the doctors complain that they are overworked and ca n't cope .
they say that they are paid a fixed sum for each examination and most of the questions in the 60 page form are irrational and a waste of time ; in short they ca n't cope .
do the government have in mind " releasing " doctors from the arduous task and instead using " specially trained personnel " , in other words office staff , to decide who should live and who should die from being forced to work when they are ill ?
robert , uk ok , so there are some kinds of disability that preclude all kinds of work , but some people could work at something , though not necessarily their original trade .
i know one person who wo n't even try to find work because the benefit is available and it would be more of a struggle to cope on low pay .
i 'm sure he 's not alone .
lee , uk certainly there should be means testing .
not every case is clear cut , and there are those in this world who will insist on getting more than their fair share and deprive others more deserving .
i have worked for an insurance company and seen many bogus disability claims .
in the long run the people that truly deserve allowances will benefit from improvements in the service .
rob , uk unless someone has something to hide , i can see no reason why they should object to a three-yearly medical .
steven baker , uk i used to represent claimants in incapacity benefit cases before social security tribunals .
i did n't come across a single case that would n't benefit from the three-year rule , which i regard as still too generous .
bilal patel , london unless someone has something to hide , i can see no reason why they should object to a three-yearly medical .
steven baker , uk i am of two minds about this .
on the one hand it appears unchristian and uncaring , whilst on the other i am aware of some people much more able-bodied than i who are claiming incapacity benefit whilst i am able to earn my living without recourse to benefits .
if checks are to be carried out every three years , then i believe they must be rigorous enough to filter out the workshy but must take care not to disadvantage those who , because of communication impairments , are unable to justify benefits which they genuinely need and should be entitled to .
steve , england instead of picking on the disabled , how about putting car drivers through an ' mot ' every three years .
traffic congestion would be sorted at a stroke , thus saving on road-building .
pressure on a & e departments would be eased which will save the nhs money too .
oops , forgot that all the drivers put off the road that lose their jobs will go onto incapacity benefit !
janet , scotland whilst i can agree with the concept to an extent , i feel that this is a bad plan .
i have seen supposed disabled people who are fit and active , and obviously playing the system - stop this at the start .
make sure that the original assessment is done by a truly unbiased independent doctor .
once this is achieved , leave them alone .
i hate to see people sponging off society , but let 's not go too far the other way , when everything is means tested , and the rules for passing are a moving target -lrb- and this will happen -rrb- designed to save the government money each year at the expense of the people they supposedly represent .
ian , uk this is not so much about saving money but more about getting people to pay tax .
if you are dishonestly on benefits then not only are you costing money directly but , more significantly , you are not paying your share of income tax to cover health / education etc .
gareth houghton , britain of course they should .
i have several friends on long-term benefits and they would have no objection to this .
the only real sense of panic stems from those with something to hide .
bill hamilton , uk most disabled people greatly fear the dss doctors maureen barnes , england no one would object to providing medical evidence of continuing health problems , but most disabled people greatly fear the dss doctors - the system is an unjust shambles - the number of people winning appeals is evidence of this .
maureen barnes , england of course benefits should be regularly checked for fraudulent claims , the rest of us that pay a fair chunk of our wages would like to be sure that it goes to people in real need .
it was never meant as a lifetime meal ticket for someone who was ill but is now ok .
as an example , which i 'm sure most people have seen themselves , i went walking in the lake district last august , and as usual the car parks were full , unless of course you had a coveted ' orange badge ' .
in drives a man in his fifties , straight into one of the disabled slots .
i was even more annoyed when he set his badge in view before striding off into the distance .
when i left the area two hours later he was still away walking , not bad for a disabled person .
no one begrudges a penny to genuine claimants , but those of us who fund the system would like to be sure that the money is being properly targeted .
stephen owen , england i 'm all against means-tested benefits , people should be given the benefit of the doubt .
bob , uk yes , of course .
all welfare benefits should be means tested to ensure that the benefit goes only to those in most need .
unfortunately in britain " means testing " is a dirty phrase , whereas in scandinavia and the rest of mainland europe is it a simple administrative measure which all recognise as necessary for a fair distribution .
patrick fidler , ireland i think it would be a good idea to wheedle out the fraudsters and make them do a decent , honest days work for a change sonia , england my mum is on benefits because she has severe arthritis of the coccyx , spine and it is spreading rapidly through her body .
she has been told she will never work again because this disease will eventually completely rob her of her mobility .
however , a man who lives up the road from her is also on benefit , has a mobility car and has had a stair lift fitted free of charge and there is nothing wrong with him .
at weekends he can be seen digging his garden .
his back is obviously not that bad because as soon as the chair lift was fitted he decided he do n't need it and de-installed it himself , those things are n't exactly lightweight .
i think it would be a good idea to wheedle out the fraudsters and make them do a decent , honest days work for a change as long as those who are in genuine need of benefit are not penalised .
sonia , england if we , as a society , do n't want " means testing " then we , as a society should be honest - be it benefits , tax or whatever .
neil , uk i believe there should be some for of re-evaluation of claims .
i am aware of several people who are simply not disabled , but by using a friendly doctor can be in a situation whereby they work all their life and then the following day are registered disabled and qualify for benefits , orange badges etc .
there should be a periodic independent review of all people claiming benefits .
the review period could be dependent on the age of the claimant with elderly claimants being checked every 5 years and with annual checks for younger claimants .
david gregory , uk i feel that annual checks is the minimum the tax paying public should expect .
after all , we are the people who are paying this .
when either the wife or husband is disabled i see no reason why the partner should not be required to go out and work .
both me and my husband work hard and it saddens me to think that any of are hard earned taxes are being wasted .
amy morley , uk not only should there be some form of check but it should be random and at short notice karl peters , uk not only should there be some form of check but it should be random and at short notice .
while i was claiming unemployment benefits some years ago i was usually given three weeks ' notice of an interview at the job centre .
three weeks is plenty time to prepare for an unscheduled hour or two away from work , for those so inclined .
if notice periods are brief , the genuine claimants will still be able to attend but the fraudsters will have more problems .
consideration should also be made of what jobs can be done by a disabled person - nowadays there is no reason why a disability which previously prevented any form of work should continue to do so -lrb- e.g. a paraplegic it worker -rrb- .
karl peters , uk i do worry that we are heading slowly for the situation in many parts of the usa where people can receive benefits for a limited time only and then are on their own no matter how unable they are to fend for themselves .
though it is surely true that some people fraudulently claim incapacity benefit the government needs to think very carefully .
it can not throw partially recovered people back into the workplace only to work for a short while and fall ill again , also if people have been unable to work for several years due to illness who will want to employ them ?
angus gulliver , uk i find this a strange piece of news , as i have been on incapacity benefit for 8 years , and have had to have a medical every year without fail .
every year i fail the test , sometimes by only one point -lrb- the dss use a " game of points " system - less than 15 and you 're out -rrb- then see my doctor who managed to keep me on incapacity benefit .
bruce ruff , uk there is means testing and there is means of testing hazel , uk there is means testing and there is means of testing .
while i acknowledge the fact that there are many idle persons hiding behind a disabled label , having detected them they will then sign on as unemployed , still costing the taxpayer .
what the government can and should do is recognise that there are plenty of disabled persons out there who would rather work , be it part or full time , but can not because there is no suitable work for them , or the premises can not or wo n't be adapted for disabled persons needs , nor are there many industries which will consider home-working unless the person concerned is a valued staff member of long standing .
hazel , uk i do n't see how people can complain about this .
some cases would need to be examined only once as the nature of the injury would prohibit working forever .
in all other cases , people should be able to prove they are just recipients .
only those that are dubious candidates would need to fear .
genuine claimants with genuine conditions should have no fear .
mike , england i 'll say !
an old friend of mine got his foot caught in a drill whilst at work .
he was in hospital for a month and came out on crutches .
now he has a very bad limp , but is classed as disabled and has n't worked for over a year .
he does n't need any support to walk , so what 's to stop him getting on a bus , going to work and sitting at a desk like the rest of us ?
it 's plain lazy , and i resent paying out for those who are basically just blaggers .
david doine , uk firstly , this is not means testing .
so comments on that subject are not relevant .
secondly , i do n't think that having a doctor confirm your claim once every three years is really such a high price for the support of the state , and by extension all the tax payers in the country , do you ?
peter , england i do n't agree with this move .
although it may save some money , it will also cause some genuine recipients to live in fear of the three-yearly re-evaluation .
i believe this is too high a price for the saving .
malcolm cleaton , england there are always those innocent people who end up being treated like criminals m. deal , uk the government is right in principle to tackle the issue of fraudulent claims .
there are a vast amount of claimants who are simply manipulating the system to avoid work .
i have certainly known a few people who have claimed incapacity benefit and yet were as fit as anyone else .
they simply wanted to avoid work .
however , as usual in these cases there are always those innocent people who end up being treated like criminals , and who really are in need of benefit .
yet even a blind person can do some sorts of work and the government should do more to train people with particular disabilities for jobs they could be doing and probably would like to do .
but yes , weed out the fraudsters , protect the genuine , and be ruthless but fair with it .
m. deal , uk i feel the only people who have a right to worry about these plans are those who are claiming when they do n't need to .
steve webster , england yes , all benefit should be means-tested or assessed periodically .
the role of the state is to provide for the poorest and disadvantaged in society - not to provide for all regardless of their ability to pay .
andreas white , united kingdom people are caught in a trap until they are well enough to go back for near normal working hours kevin anderson , uk my wife has been unable to work for nearly 4 years due to illness - although recovering she would even now only be able to work 1-2 hours per day for 2-3 times per week .
employers are unwilling to offer flexible working hours and the pay would not match the benefits lost so people are caught in a trap until they are well enough to go back for near normal working hours .
means testing should only be introduced when there is some way of getting back into work on reduced or flexible hours .
kevin anderson , uk yes they should be tested on a regular basis to see if they can work .
that way people who really need the benefits will get them and people who can work will stop sponging off the country .
i know people on these benefits who are able to work but would rather live off whatever benefits they can get .
this is the sort of thing we can do to target those in need and stop the freeloaders .
martin , yorkshire the reduction in fraudulent benefit claims would free up cash for more deserving , genuine cases cav , uk anybody claiming benefit -lrb- of any kind -rrb- should be subject to regular or perhaps random checks .
i see no harm in this at all .
the reduction in fraudulent benefit claims would free up ' cash ' for more deserving , genuine cases .
careful steps should be taken to avoid heavy pressure on people with a disability that are rightfully receiving benefit , who may think that the awards are ' not worth the trouble ' or feel belittled by the experience .
equally , too soft a touch would leave hardened benefit fraudsters laughing all the way to the bank .
cav , uk there 's me , thinking that the tories lost the last election .
whatever next - privatisation of the health service and the london underground ?
whatever happened to the third way ?
bob , uk if you have nothing to hide then every 3 years you can prove you should get the benefit .
too many people claim it when they can work .
this method of checking will find out who has been cheating the system and save the taxpayer plenty of money to be used on other areas .
kris , uk i 'm not prepared to let people continue to leech off the state randy , uk as with all benefits relating to the ability or otherwise to work , there are those amongst the claimants who choose to abuse the system , cultivate the help of gullible , over-stretched doctors , and who also earn in the black economy .
i know of one .
many others will be known to their friends and families .
i 'm not prepared to let such people continue to leech off the state .
true disability is another thing , but to assess claimants ' qualification for benefit can not be written off as harassment or needlessly causing distress .
it has to be done to ensure the benefit gets to the deserving .
remember , the more fraudulent claimants there are , the less there is to go round for the genuine cases and the rest of society .
it comes from our pockets through taxation and should be taken seriously , not just given away when demanded .
randy , uk exactly how much will this means testing add to the total bill for this benefit ?
this is the question which must be answered before we even begin to ask whether it is morally right to means -lrb- or should that be mean ? -rrb- test disabled people .
despite the apparent belief of government ministers that bureaucracy comes free of charge , it does n't .
the army of civil servants and hangers-on who would be needed to administer these checks would surely more than negate the savings achieved by being so penny-pinching .
david hazel , uk why not ?
a check up every 3 years in return for ongoing benefit seems a tiny inconvenience for someone with a genuine problem .
also technology is changing , bringing opportunities to those to work , who could not do so before .
and , let 's face it , there is a lot of fraud going on .
i can only think of one person i knew on permanent invalidity benefit .
he was paid because his eyesight was too poor for him to work .
oddly , his eyesight was fine for driving .
andyc , uk this will end up just like the child support agency andrew whiteside , uk this will end up just like the child support agency , by penalising the honest and genuine but not tackling the fraudster , who will always find a way around the system .
time to think again , mr darling .

children at a uk primary school are having to practise for their local sports day in the middle of a public road .
the playground at curledge street primary school in paignton , devon , has had classrooms built on it , which means there is nowhere big enough to run the 100 metres sprint or to set out hurdles , and the school can not afford to pay to use local playing fields .
the government claims it has ended the loss of school playing fields , but the national playing fields association claims that a large proportion of applications are still approved .
it says schools are having to sell them to raise money or use them to build new classrooms .
what is your experience ?
have you lost your school playing field ?
has it affected your education ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction with more of today 's parents wary of letting their young children play freely outside , school fields and playgrounds are the only form of exercise some children get .
i think it 's a great shame that schools are put in the position that they have to raise money by selling off one of the greatest assets they have .
i work in a secondary school and at break and lunchtime the majority of children will head out to the field , luckily attached to the school .
they run around or play football with friends and generally let off steam .
i doubt that these activities would be quite so appealing in the confined , small schoolyard .
megan m. thomas , west wales , uk i just ca n't wait every week for the physical fitness class chan shio fong , singapore definitely not !
my school has not lost its playing fields .
though my primary school is not a prestigious one -lrb- a neighbourhood one -rrb- we have a middle-sized field just behind our school .
though it 's not big , i just ca n't wait every week for the physical fitness class .
though my school does not have a court for tennis or badminton , our teacher will book a court every week just for us to have fun .
sport is an important activity for all especially in primary level .
it not only builds the children 's interest but gradually increases the level of interest in their favourite sport .
it also improves their confidence & mental ability .
chan shio fong , singapore i am a pensioner who lives near a school .
most of the children that used the playing fields out of school time were little thugs , involved in vandalism and petty crime .
the fields have been sold and houses built - some very nice families have moved in , including some refugees - and the whole neighbourhood has improved .
gordon , uk i grew up in hong kong where the only place to go for sports and pe was the concrete playground in which 1000 students would congregate every break .
there was barely enough space for anything .
i went to the uk for a term when my grandparents were dying and experienced such a different lifestyle when it came not only to sports but also to outdoor life .
sportsmen in hk are n't the best and it 's not about it being a small place and not enough people , hk out populates wales and scotland , north ireland and the republic of ireland -lrb- albeit not altogether ! -rrb- and yet when you look at it they have many more quality sport teams and personalities .
it is n't lack of funding either because hk is n't a poor city at all and rumour has it that the hk rugby association is one of the richest per capita .
the lack of places to practise is a major contribution to a floundering programme .
the space simply gives the option for a higher calibre .
nathan , hong kong the pressure on schools to ignore sports and recreation is increasing all the time j black , uk i agree with peter , if you want to do sport then go ahead , if you do n't have the choice to do a vocational or academic subject .
however with league tables the pressure on schools to ignore sports and recreation is increasing all the time .
i know of a school which had talented sports stars - ironically tennis was their biggest success - and the school would not support them to go through to the county championships and subsequently the students lost all interest in sport and gave up totally .
just think , one of them could have been at wimbledon this year !
so please look after the resources for those who want to do sport - which can be non-competitive also .
j black , uk as a child , i attended infant , junior and secondary schools that had no playing fields , and only a small square of rough , sloping concrete to play upon .
we still managed to play rounders , 5-a-side football , netball , and other games .
at secondary school the playing field was a 10-minute walk away , across 2 busy roads and down the town 's main shopping street .
as a result , most pe was taken either in the gym / assembly hall or in the concreted playground .
the trick is to make the most of what you 've got .
this builds self-reliance and self-esteem in staff and pupils alike , and prepares them better for the challenges of life ahead .
jessica tatterson , uk most school playing fields are wasted space p , uk the loss of a playing field would not have affected my education one iota .
sport is , in my opinion , something you should be encouraged to try and allowed to do if you 're inclined .
i got nothing out of sport at school and hated every minute of it - i could have spent the time on something infinitely more useful .
most school playing fields are wasted space .
if kids are into sport they will always find time and space for it and it 's not as if there are n't clubs and other bodies external to schools which can cater for their needs .
why ca n't schools concentrate on teaching kids what they need to know in the big bad world outside of school ?
prowess in sport is n't going to get them productive jobs ! !
p , uk i went to a private school with gorgeous and historic grounds in somerset , which we happily shared with the local comprehensive for free .
however , returning there last weekend i found that the land had been appropriated by the council to build a bypass .
now , my old school has further grounds outside the town , and the means to get its pupils there , but the comprehensive is now reduced to using a rather nasty concrete area .
charles , uk in my studying time at primary school , there was limited space for sports and play .
there was also lack of facilities .
but nowadays , schools are big enough .
they have their own playground and have good facilities such as computer room and library etc .
they have a better study environment than that i had .
man , hong kong young people need to learn maths , english and it skills to get on in life .
they also need to learn how to look after their bodies peter , uk young people need to learn maths , english and it skills to get on in life .
they also need to learn how to look after their bodies .
but this can be achieved in lots of different ways , many of which are non-competitive and do not inflict humiliation on children .
there is no more need to practice competitive sports than there is to learn basket-weaving .
the attitude that playing more soccer / rugby / hockey / cricket or whatever will do children good and be character forming should have been buried with conscription and cold showers .
if they want to do it - fine , if they do n't , do n't force them .
peter , uk schools in the cardiff area have had to sell off land to raise money .
it has always struck me as strange why the general public can not hire out gym , field equipment at night , weekends to raise funds for schools .
phil daw , uk this is an absolute disgrace .
no swimming , no field sports .
just burgers and chips and a quick fag !
jason , england my old school sold off a large chunk of land for houses to be built on it .
now the school playing fields are 2 miles away - a bit too far to go for a game of footy at lunch time !
dominic , uk it 's funny , i thought battery hens were looked upon badly in society craig barber , england i am in sixth form , and now that we got 2 new structures , it has left our school yard withering and our field slowly decreasing in size .
it 's funny , i thought battery hens were looked upon badly in society , yet do teachers not realise that kids are being locked up too , and with little space to relax anymore ?
craig barber , england , in my school there is n't a really big playing field , but for the 1000 metres , we just run around the school a couple of times .
if we are really stuck , we hire a playing field !

an operation room has been set up at the army barracks in brecon as a base for the vets who are likely to take several days completing the task .
a small army team is helping the operation and special pens have been built to hold the animals while blood tests are carried out .
this is the biggest operation of its kind in wales since the epidemic began .
nine flocks will be driven separately into the awaiting pens , where they will have to remain until they are given the all-clear .
experts working throughout the weekend have been consulting local farmers on the best way to tackle the challenge .
results so far have indicated that an outbreak which infected five farms at libanus has not been transmitted to livestock on the hills .
crisis in wales total confirmed cases in wales - 97 powys - 61 cases anglesey - 13 cases monmouthshire - 16 cases caerphilly 2 rhondda cynon taff - 1 neath port talbot -1 newport - 3 nevertheless , the welsh assembly has decided to carry out mass testing as a precaution .
but graziers are angry at the time it is taking for the outcome of blood test results to be determined .
many are concerned that 150 sheep have been kept enclosed in small spaces for 10 days with little grass - while their owners wait for results to be returned .
now they are insisting that the process must be speeded up .
movement ban there was relief among farmers last week when preliminary tests of animals on the brecon beacons appeared to give the area the all-clear .
however , as a precaution , a ban on the movement of all animals was extended as far as the heads of the valleys and into the upper swansea valley .
the only livestock allowed to move are now those bound for slaughter .
it has been established that the virus discovered at five locations in libanus was probably spread from farm to farm by people and not animals .
still suffering eanwhile , the assembly 's finance minister edwina hart has announced that special grant money to help businesses hit by foot-and-mouth which has not been spent by local authorities will be reallocated to the worst-hit areas .
she said she had written to all local authorites to find out about unused money which could be redistributed to areas where the economy is continuing to suffer .
mrs hart said : " i have always made clear that i would review the use of the special grant money , and consider at that point what more might need to be done to help affected businesses .
" we have written to all local authorities asking them to let us know whether they have unused money that we can redistribute to those areas whose economies continue to suffer as a result of the outbreak .
" in the light of that information and the latest evidence on the impact of foot and mouth on rural businesses , i will decide how best to target the reallocation of grant money to help those that are struggling to survive . "

trouble flared several hours after the annual church parade by members of the orange order at drumcree had passed off peacefully .
the parade has been barred from marching down the mainly nationalist garvaghy road , near portadown , for the fourth consecutive year .
the order wants to use the route on its return journey from a somme commemoration service at drumcree parish church , but the march is opposed by nationalist residents .
security fence a huge steel and concrete security barrier had been put in place to prevent the orangemen from proceeding down the garvaghy road .
a crowd of 400 people gathered at drumcree hill and a small section of them threw stones and petrol bombs over the top of the security fence .

a verbal protest was made by the orangemen at the barrier last year , province-wide protests in support of the orangemen led to widespread disruption as roads were blocked and loyalist rioting marked several nights of violence .
however , the atmosphere during the day was calm as more than 2,000 orangemen began their annual parade from carleton street on sunday morning and moved countryward along the corcrain road , to the hill at drumcree .

the orangemen then walked back up the hill and dispersed .
later sinn fein assembly member dara o 'hagan said the orange order needed to talk to the residents before progress could be made .

" let there be fireworks and bells rung on this day and universal rejoicing throughout this new republic . "
so wrote john adams , first vice-president , second president of the united states , after the 4th of july had been proclaimed as the official date celebrating the independence of the 13 colonies .
they do n't ring bells much anymore , though in philadelphia , where the founding fathers wrote the constitution , they produce a ceremonial clang on the so-called liberty bell - an old , cracked 18th century bell - made in london , by the way - that was rung at the first reading of the declaration of independence .
fireworks certainly blazed from sea to shining sea , under the official auspices that is of state or city officials .
the 4th used to be , as late as the second world war , a day on which just about every city and small town in the country held a parade or an assembly in a public park where the mayor or the local congressman made the fanciest speech he could concoct about the blessings of liberty and of simply being an american .
the president of the united states still makes a public speech to the same effect and the newspapers dutifully print , or used to , a tribute to thomas jefferson , who everybody knows wrote the declaration of independence , became the third president of the united states , bought one third of the land area of america from napoleon - for four cents an acre - and saved the nation from conquest by the french .
down the years , the centuries , jefferson has become specially identified with the character of the republic because he had positive and very vocal ideas about the things , the practices , that should distinguish it from the monarchy that they 'd shed .
during the debating and writing of the constitution he was in london , but he kept as closely in touch with philadelphia as the shipping schedules would allow and was always dashing off little notes about what a republic should not have .
he was dead against the suggestion that the new chief executive should be called " his excellency " .
" mr president " would do .
as for titles of nobility : " not to be granted by this republic .
a very great vanity , " he called them .
and do n't copy the english custom of having judges wear wigs .
let us on our benches have no mice peeping out of oakum .
he was appalled when the constitution was finished and had composed no bill of rights and it was mainly at his insistence that this error was corrected .
however , this year , along with the general celebrations , there has appeared across the country a rash of pieces demeaning jefferson .
his memory has been under a cloud ever since a very old rumour appeared to be confirmed that he 'd fathered at least one child by one of his black slaves .
an early report on dna evidence seemed to clinch the matter and suddenly he was a famous hypocrite who had many slaves , never freed them , swore he would die to ensure the liberty of man - provided he was not black .
a dozen famous scholars protested the haste with which the dna testimony had been published and they went over it with forensic lawyers .
and it comes out that what the dna evidence shows is that that particular slave child was fathered by an unidentifiable one of 24 jeffersons living in virginia at the time of the conception .
the 64-year-old jefferson living in washington was the least likely suspect .
it will take time , as always , for the truth to overtake the luscious rumour .
meanwhile here in brooklyn a whole team of sculptors are busy preparing statues of the 39 men who signed the constitution and the three men who dissented .
the artists have almost nothing to go on by way of impersonating in bronze or clay these worthies , most of the time only a name and his age .
but they are determined to finish the job and install all 42 images in philadelphia by independence day 2003 .
incidentally , a californian congressman has presented to congress a bizarre bill , very unlikely to pass i should think , proposing that every state in the union should erect a statue of ronald reagan .
oh and , oh yes .
another monarchical fol de rol jefferson said a republic must not have : " no public statues " .
well he won on the wigs and the titles but lost handsomely on the statues , as a jaunt through any american city will tell you .
the first week in july i have to say always strikes a wistful note these days .
it 's the last week of wimbledon and for many years it meant for me being present always on the thursday for the women 's semi-finals and again on the saturday for the women 's finals .
as for the men , i chose to stay beside the tele and stay with it as long as it was interesting , which was very rarely five sets .
why this preoccupation with the women ?
is it because in general i like women better than men ?
well yes that 's true , but it 's not the reason for my indifference to men 's tennis at wimbledon .
i shall tell you a couple of stories and soon all will be made clear .
a few years ago an american friend who watches a good deal of tennis went , for the first time , to england during the fortnight dedicated to the all england lawn tennis club .
every time he turned on the tube - tennis , tennis .
he came back his eyes gleaming , his head shaking with disbelief .
" by god , " he said , " the british are crazy about tennis are n't they ? "
" well no , " i said , " they 're crazy about wimbledon .
it 's a national festival .
like the derby , where everybody drops a bob or two whether they know one end of a horse from another .
" old ladies watch wimbledon every year who 've never seen a tennis racket anywhere else . "
second story .
about 10 days ago an old english friend of mine , who sees very little tennis through the year but regards wimbledon as an annual religious requirement , as atheists attend the church funeral of a friend .
we talked about this and that and the coming excitement , from my point of view , of seeing how kuerten and young lleyton hewitt and the belgian girls - claysters and henin - would do at wimbledon .
and my old friend said : " the women yes but i 've given up on men 's tennis . "
as max wall used to say : " pourquoi ? "
" because , " he said , " it 's so dull . "
this is such an old story in england that i did n't go on and say , which is true , that so far this year i 've watched the quarter finals , semis and finals of , i should say , 15 tournaments and the indelible memories are of royal battles between the men - too many to particularise .
the pros - men and women - play about 40 tournaments in the year .
thirty nine of them are played on hard courts .
the four or five tournaments leading up to the french open on clay .
so ?
so wimbledon is played on grass .
and compared with all other surfaces which arrest the landing of the ball and let it bounce , by comparison a man 's very fast serve on grass can be more like a bullet zipping through a marsh .
what this means is the men - and by now there are a dozen of them who can serve at a 120 miles an hour or more - simply serve - bam - and half the time the opponent ca n't possibly return it .
i recall a wimbledon final - oh , it must be 10 years ago - between the two germans , michael stick and boris becker .
i had the grim pleasure of seeing it through in the flesh .
it was achingly dull because over the whole three and a half or whatever hours the average rally was four strokes .
serve - slam , bang - a sputtering or decent return - a withering slice - a return into the net .
because of this very plight there was then a tremendous to do in tennis circles in britain which coincided , not accidentally , with the arrival of the new rackets and the thunderbolt serve .
what to do ?
all sorts of serious as well as wild suggestions were made .
reduce the size of the service box .
the most daring and impossible suggestion was : why not limit the game to one serve ?
in golf , we chasers of little white balls remarked : " you do n't drive a ball out of bounds and then say ' oh too bad , i 'll watch the next one ' . "
i believe the hullabaloo has died down because i 'm told that wimbledon has a new type of grass which slows the ball .
and what with that and the hot , dry weather during the past two weeks it has shown a marked improvement , though i 'd say not yet enough .
so why do i recall so many marvellous men 's matches along this year 's tour - in california , in florida , rome , hamburg , and , my goodness , kuerten coming from two sets down and match point to a heroic victory in paris , the clay capital of the world ?
because the average rally between the men in the 15 or so tournaments i 've watched was 12 to 15 strokes - four or five at wimbledon .
i remember one set-to between the young roddick and the young hewitt that went to 32 strokes as thousands wept and cheered .
in simpler words : men 's tennis on any surface other than grass reveals the whole game , not just the serve and return , of a man at full stretch .
need i say that nowhere else in the world , i believe , has there been any debate on what to do about men 's tennis .
and this leads back , does it not , to the dreaded word : grass .
and if you say , by the way , how about kuerten and corretja - the finalists in the french open - why were n't they at wimbledon ?
well they withdraw , citing - i love the word " citing " - injuries .
let 's not go too clinically into the " injuries " of all the hispanic players - the spanish especially - who did not appear at wimbledon .
they were brought up on clay , they hate grass and , in effect , boycott wimbledon .
when the british hassle was at its most contentious peter sampras said : " it 's simple , if you want rallies abolish grass . "
and just before this year 's wimbledon the recent number one in the world , perhaps spoke too soon , but marcelo rios put it more succinctly : " grass , " he said , " it 's for cows .

the times of zambia has a front-page photograph of libyan security officers running alongside the limousine carrying colonel muammar gaddafi .
but few people it seems have managed to catch a glimpse of the libyan leader .
the zambia daily mail reports that scores of people gathered at a mosque in lusaka on sunday in the hope of seeing him .
they were then told that the mosque was n't a suitable venue for colonel gaddafi to come and pray with local muslims , because of security concerns .
to the annoyance of local residents , says the paper , colonel gaddafi 's meeting subsequently took place at the residence of the libyan ambassador .
sleepy lusaka - the normally sleepy capital of zambia - is not used to so much international attention .
the daily mail sums up the novelty of zambia hosting a major conference with the headline : " more presidents jet in " .
the lead story below is simply a catalogue of which african heads of state have arrived in lusaka , and who is in their delegations .
unless your interest is : who 's who in africa , it is not an article that 's going to boost the paper 's circulation .
both the main papers contain supplements on this african leaders ' summit .
new beginning this is the moment when the organisation of african unity - formed in 1963 - is being transformed into a new african union .
in an editorial , the times says the au , whatever form it takes , promises a new beginning for africa which for centuries has borne the tag of the dark continent .
the paper says that should the leaders gathered here this week , fail to tackle the problem of refugees , then measures must be put in place to help countries bearing the burden of large refugee populations .
it warns that the new african union must start on a clean slate .
the daily mail comments that africa now has to look inwards for solutions to its economic problems .
it points out that only three of the 53 members of the oau are considerably wealthy , but the paper is nevertheless optimistic that the african union will provide a base for a united and focused assault on poverty , hunger and disease .
away from the summit , the main interest in zambia is in the apparent assassination of a leading opposition figure , paul tembo , at his home last friday .
the daily mail says zambian investigators are getting ready to work with scotland yard detectives who 've been asked to help the local police with the inquiry .
