and as bbc news online 's david schepp explains , american juries are sending strong messages to tobacco companies about the dangers of their product for the second time this week , a us jury has sided against the tobacco industry .
this time , a los angles superior court jury awarded a california man a record $ 3bn -lrb- Â£ 2.15bn -rrb- in punitive damages - by far the largest award ever given to a single individual .
this man 's life is over - $ 3 billion does n't even begin to cover it juror denise key the jury , in making its decision , said cigarette-manufacturer philip morris engaged in fraud and negligence and produced a defective product .
the ruling sent shock waves through the tobacco industry , which was still recovering from monday 's decision by a brooklyn jury to award a major health insurer nearly $ 18m in damages for compensation for smoking-related costs .
the jury in that case found that philip morris and other tobacco companies engaged in deceptive business practices in a case brought by empire blue cross / blue shield .
smoked for 40 years the plaintiff in the california case , richard boeken , smoked two packs of marlboro cigarettes a day over the last 40 years .
philip morris contends he ignored health warnings , which have been printed on the side of cigarette packs since the 1960s in the us .
tobacco lawyers were watching the outcome of the california case closely because it was the first such case to reach trial in los angeles .
cigarette makers are fending off three other california lawsuits in which they have been ordered to pay damages .
gargantuan decision the verdict is not just big , it is gargantuan - nearly 40 times larger than the $ 80m awarded an oregon man in 1998 , which was subsequently greatly reduced by a judge .
because the industry 's so big , any jury has to come up with an amount that 's pretty sizable to make the tobacco companies at least notice what they are saying anti-tobacco lawyer ed sweda jurors who spoke out after the decision had little sympathy for philip morris and the tobacco industry - while anti-tobacco groups hailed the decision .
ed sweda , an attorney with the tobacco products liability project at northeastern university in boston said the verdict sent a message that juries were not getting soft on tobacco litigation .
" because the industry 's so big , any jury has to come up with an amount that 's pretty sizable to make the tobacco companies at least notice what they are saying .
this verdict is certainly just and proper given what the company engaged in and continues to engage in , " he said .
tailspin some analysts pondered whether the two decisions would send tobacco stocks into a tailspin .
tobacco stocks in recent months have enjoyed strong gains after suffering under a 1998 settlement with dozens of states that cost the industry billions of dollars in fines and other expenses .
shares of philip morris fell in response to the verdict , losing $ 1.75 in after-hours trading , having closed at $ 50 a share during regular new york trading .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- ecb under fire over euro low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo thursday , 7 june , 2001 , 06:38 gmt 07:38 uk ecb under fire over euro ecb president wim duisenberg is under pressure by the bbc 's europe business correspondent jonathan charles the board of the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- meets in frankfurt on thursday morning to examine whether the recent fall in the value of the euro will require any change in its policies .
the euro is hovering around levels not seen since early last summer , at $ 0.8471 at 0600 gmt , pulled lower by weak growth in the eurozone .
against sterling , the euro stood at Â£ 0.6084 .
the bank , which is responsible for the day-to-day running of the single currency , has been partially blamed by some politicians and economists for the drop in the euro 's value .
a growing number of economists and politicians are queueing up to question its competence .
during the past few weeks the euro has again fallen sharply in value on the foreign exchanges .
rising inflation the ecb is being blamed for causing part of the drop , and board members will examine whether anything can be done when they meet in frankfurt on thursday morning .
the institution 's president , wim duisenberg , triggered another fall a few days ago when he appeared to suggest he was n't concerned about the value of the euro .
the bank also seems to be failing to get a grip on rising prices across the eurozone - the rate of inflation , at almost 3 % , is way above target .
the competence of the central bank would be an issue in any future debate about whether britain should join the euro .
mr duisenberg and his colleagues still have a great deal of work to do if they want to regain the confidence of many in the financial markets .
econmists expect the ecb to leave interest rates unchanged at 4.5 % , but but the bank does appear to be gearing up for a further easing move later in june or in july .

the euro is hovering around levels not seen since early last summer , at $ 0.8471 at 0600 gmt , pulled lower by weak growth in the eurozone .
against sterling , the euro stood at Â£ 0.6084 .
the bank , which is responsible for the day-to-day running of the single currency , has been partially blamed by some politicians and economists for the drop in the euro 's value .
a growing number of economists and politicians are queueing up to question its competence .
during the past few weeks the euro has again fallen sharply in value on the foreign exchanges .
rising inflation the ecb is being blamed for causing part of the drop , and board members will examine whether anything can be done when they meet in frankfurt on thursday morning .
the institution 's president , wim duisenberg , triggered another fall a few days ago when he appeared to suggest he was n't concerned about the value of the euro .
the bank also seems to be failing to get a grip on rising prices across the eurozone - the rate of inflation , at almost 3 % , is way above target .
the competence of the central bank would be an issue in any future debate about whether britain should join the euro .
mr duisenberg and his colleagues still have a great deal of work to do if they want to regain the confidence of many in the financial markets .
econmists expect the ecb to leave interest rates unchanged at 4.5 % , but but the bank does appear to be gearing up for a further easing move later in june or in july .
the news conference that is scheduled to follow today 's council meeting will give ecb president wim duisenberg an opportunity to prepare markets for such a move , they said .

as part of a new initiative designed to shake off its elitist image , medical schools are turning to students from places not normally associated with careers in medicine .
the university of wales college of medicine has confirmed it is seeking out talented teenagers from less privileged backgrounds .
at the last count , just 5 % of students at the medical school in cardiff came from the poorer groups in society .
efforts are now being made to even out the balance .
professor ilora finlay from the university of wales college of medicine believes that it is all about confidence .
she said : " what we need to do is attract the children from those backgrounds where they do n't have the confidence in themselves and say please come and study with us we want you , your just as goos as anybody else . "
teenagers from schools in areas like merthyr tydfil , the cynon valley , and cardiff , are all part of the project which is targeting non-traditional areas in the search for new talent .
there are no guarantees of a place on a course .
numbers dropping however , all who apply are being assured that , with the right grades , they will have the same chance of success , as anyone else .
recent research has shown that number of young people applying to study medicine has dropped significantly - despite efforts to recruit more doctors .
the universities and colleges admission service reported that applicants for medicine dropped more than 3 % to 9,291 last year .
at the same time , the number of medical school places is being increased by more than 1,000 in a bid to tackle the shortage of nhs doctors .
potential students last year 's fall in applications followed a decision by ucas to bring forward the deadline for medicine and dentistry by two months in order to reduce the number of candidates .
medical schools had previously had difficulty in coping with the administration involved in processing applications and interviewing potential students .
the nhs is chronically short of trained doctors but the current problem is compounded by the fact that the biggest drop in applicants is among men .
' disappointment ' women doctors are more likely to take career breaks or work part-time - meaning even larger numbers needed to be trained .
the british medical association has pointed out that the number of applicants to medical schools has dropped 20 % over the past three years .
and the council of heads of medical schools has expressed disappointment that the number is continuing to decline when there is a rapid expansion in the number of student places .
entrants to medical school generally need to gain at least 3 as at a level to obtain a place , so the council will be monitoring to ensure the entry qualifications remain the same .
the bma is of the view that the high cost of studying medicine is putting many young people off .

it was a loss of innocence , of naivety .
and it changed the way americans looked at terrorism .
in the end , the deadliest terrorist of all was a clean-cut boy from buffalo analyst mark potok for decades , the debate amongst terrorism analysts was when there would be a major attack on us soil , said frank cilluffo , an expert on terrorism at the center for strategic and international studies .
that debate ended abruptly with the bombing of the world trade center in 1993 and the bombing of the murrah federal building in oklahoma city in 1995 , he added .
and instead of looking for threats abroad , americans suddenly became aware of the enemy within .
changing face of terrorism " for many , many years , americans thought of terrorists as arabs , period , " said mark potok , editor of the southern poverty legal center 's intelligence report .
the report tracks hate groups and extremist activity in the us .
mcveigh faces death by lethal injection in the hours after the oklahoma city bombing , fingers pointed to a middle eastern organisation , mr cilluffo said .
" but in the end , the deadliest terrorist of all was a clean-cut boy from buffalo , " mr potok said .
it had a profound effect on americans .
" it woke the country up from its naivety that everyone loves america .
it is not the case .
it is not just threats from abroad , " mr cilluffo said .
lone wolf to meet this new threat , the country dramatically stepped up its counter-terrorism efforts .
" oklahoma city changed the landscape in american law enforcement , no doubt about it , " said mr potok .
the fbi hired 500 new agents to investigate domestic terrorism , he said .
virtually every state and federal law enforcement agency formed a domestic terrorism unit , he added .
and in the wake of the bombing , the focus turned from groups abroad to anti-government militias .
what can you do to stop a lone wolf in an open society ?
it is a fundamental question .
you do not want to build too many walls terrorism expert frank cilluffo " law enforcement , like many other groups , tended to view these groups as a joke " before the bombing , mr potok said .
" it was hard to take them seriously .
they said that stickers on the back of signs gave secret directions to invading un troops .
they said that a secret weather machine in brussels was destroying american agriculture , " he added .
but the bombing in oklahoma city changed that forever , mr potok says .
however , the initial backlash against the militias was heavy handed and perhaps unwarranted , according to mr cilluffo .
mcveigh was a lone wolf , not a part of a larger movement .
" he went to the fringes of american society and found they did not reaffirm his beliefs .
he thought they did not go far enough , " mr cilluffo said .
and it forced the country to ask questions about its response to this new threat .
" what can you do to stop a lone wolf in an open society ?
it is a fundamental question .
you do not want to build too many walls , " he said .
that would threaten the american way of life , and the battle would already be lost , he added .
psychological impact but mr cilluffo has come away with a sense of hope in the wake of the oklahoma city bombing .
the impact of terrorism is more than the sheer physical devastation of a bombed out building and the loss of 168 lives .
terrorism is just as important a psychological weapon .
the bombing changed the way america looked at terrorism groups do not claim responsibility for terrorism because " it keeps people on edge , " he says .
it is the fear of not knowing who carried out the attack and where and when they might strike next .
other countries have learnt to deal with the psychological uncertainty , but this was new for the united states .
mr cilluffo recently went to the observance of the anniversary of the oklahoma city bombing .
at the museum , there is a section with personal effects from those who died in the bombing .
" there was a sneaker there my daughter has .
it touched a raw nerve , " he said .
but he left with a sense of pride .
the community had demonstrated strength and resilience , he said .
he said that it highlights what could be the american response to terrorism .
" we will prevail .
you will fail , " he said .

it was a loss of innocence , of naivety .
and it changed the way americans looked at terrorism .
in the end , the deadliest terrorist of all was a clean-cut boy from buffalo analyst mark potok for decades , the debate amongst terrorism analysts was when there would be a major attack on us soil , said frank cilluffo , an expert on terrorism at the center for strategic and international studies .
that debate ended abruptly with the bombing of the world trade center in 1993 and the bombing of the murrah federal building in oklahoma city in 1995 , he added .
and instead of looking for threats abroad , americans suddenly became aware of the enemy within .
changing face of terrorism " for many , many years , americans thought of terrorists as arabs , period , " said mark potok , editor of the southern poverty legal center 's intelligence report .
the report tracks hate groups and extremist activity in the us .
in the hours after the oklahoma city bombing , fingers pointed to a middle eastern organisation , mr cilluffo said .
" but in the end , the deadliest terrorist of all was a clean-cut boy from buffalo , " mr potok said .
it had a profound effect on americans .
" it woke the country up from its naivety that everyone loves america .
it is not the case .
it is not just threats from abroad , " mr cilluffo said .
lone wolf to meet this new threat , the country dramatically stepped up its counter-terrorism efforts .
" oklahoma city changed the landscape in american law enforcement , no doubt about it , " said mr potok .
the fbi hired 500 new agents to investigate domestic terrorism , he said .
virtually every state and federal law enforcement agency formed a domestic terrorism unit , he added .
and in the wake of the bombing , the focus turned from groups abroad to anti-government militias .
what can you do to stop a lone wolf in an open society ?
it is a fundamental question .
you do not want to build too many walls terrorism expert frank cilluffo " law enforcement , like many other groups , tended to view these groups as a joke " before the bombing , mr potok said .
" it was hard to take them seriously .
they said that stickers on the back of signs gave secret directions to invading un troops .
they said that a secret weather machine in brussels was destroying american agriculture , " he added .
but the bombing in oklahoma city changed that forever , mr potok says .
however , the initial backlash against the militias was heavy handed and perhaps unwarranted , according to mr cilluffo .
mcveigh was a lone wolf , not a part of a larger movement .
" he went to the fringes of american society and found they did not reaffirm his beliefs .
he thought they did not go far enough , " mr cilluffo said .
and it forced the country to ask questions about its response to this new threat .
" what can you do to stop a lone wolf in an open society ?
it is a fundamental question .
you do not want to build too many walls , " he said .
that would threaten the american way of life , and the battle would already be lost , he added .
psychological impact but mr cilluffo has come away with a sense of hope in the wake of the oklahoma city bombing .
the impact of terrorism is more than the sheer physical devastation of a bombed out building and the loss of 168 lives .
terrorism is just as important a psychological weapon .
groups do not claim responsibility for terrorism because " it keeps people on edge , " he says .
it is the fear of not knowing who carried out the attack and where and when they might strike next .
other countries have learnt to deal with the psychological uncertainty , but this was new for the united states .
mr cilluffo recently went to the observance of the anniversary of the oklahoma city bombing .
at the museum , there is a section with personal effects from those who died in the bombing .
" there was a sneaker there my daughter has .
it touched a raw nerve , " he said .
but he left with a sense of pride .
the community had demonstrated strength and resilience , he said .
he said that it highlights what could be the american response to terrorism .
" we will prevail .
you will fail , " he said .

his move raises fears that economic slowdown could make countries increasingly protectionist .
there are always flare ups when the economy starts slowing dr razeen sally london school of economics his decision to probe steel imports prompted hostile reactions from the eu , japan and china amid clear signs that the world is heading into a steel war , just seven weeks after the three-year long banana war ended .
and many other simmering disputes between trade partners could be heightened by the political and economic pressures created through a slowdown .
spiralling trade wars and rising anti-globalisation fervour could make the meeting of the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- in qatar in november highly contentious .
propping up industry the rest of the world has been eager to see the new us administration 's stance on trade issues .
now , some analysts think that president bush 's aggressive stance on steel may set the agenda for wider trade issues , in spite of his reputation as a champion of free trade .
bush has ordered the us international trade commission to launch a full investigation of the steel industry for suspected dumping - the illegal practice of selling exports at a price lower than it costs in the home market .
" it 's in our nations ' interest to make sure that if there are unfair trade practices in the steel industry , we address them in a very aggressive way , " said bush .
the way that ' unfair trade ' is defined is so broad that it encompasses most normal business practices gary hufbauer institute of international economics but many experts suspect that the us cries of " unfair trade practice " are an excuse for bush to prop up an ailing industry .
the us steel industry is notoriously inefficient , with 18 us steel firms filing for bankruptcy protection , and 20,000 steel workers laid off since 1998 .
eu objections the european union has also been quick to voice its disapproval .
" the cost of restructuring in the us steel industry should not be shifted onto the rest of the world , " said eu trade commissioner pascal lamy in a statement , which referred to the move as " protectionist safeguard measures " .
" disputes will intensify .
we will study and take corresponding measures , " warned a chinese steel industry official .
trade wars are an area where the tit-for-tat mentality comes into its own .
" the danger is that a relatively minor dispute can escalate to the point where relations breakdown , " said dr razeen sally , a senior lecturer at the london school of economics .
the cost of restructuring in the us steel industry should not be shifted onto the rest of the world pascal lamy eu trade commissioner the chinese government has threatened to curb car imports from japan in retaliation for japanese import restrictions on chinese mushrooms , spring onions and hand towels .
china may also suspend imports of south korean mobile phones and polyethylene if korea does n't import thousands of tonnes of chinese garlic .
the eu and the us are locked in a number of complex trade disputes , including the labelling of genetically modified beef , the legality of export tax rebates , and the subsidy of airbus manufacturing .
obliterating foreign competition if the investigation confirms the existence of ' unfair trade practices ' the us will be allowed to impose hefty anti-dumping taxes on imports that could obliterate competition from abroad .
it has become much easier to prove that goods are being dumped and thus easier for protectionist governments to impose taxes .
" the way that ' unfair trade ' is defined is so broad that it encompasses most normal business practices , " said mr hufbauer , adding that this is the huge gaping hole in wto policy .
this has meant that the practice of imposing anti-dumping taxes has grown rapidly over the past years .
" it 's a game being played by both the eu and the us .
and developing countries such as brazil and india are joining in , " said dr sally .
but it 's also a game that seriously hampers the growth of industries in the developing world , as they often do not have the finances and resources to fight such legal battles .
rising protectionism the pressures of a global economic slowdown - together with strong currencies in the uk and the us - will lead to even greater pressure for government action .
aggressively protectionist policies are most apparent in the aftermath of severe economic crises such as currency devaluations or the asian crash .
but it also comes into play with milder slowdowns , such as that occurring in the us at the moment .
" there are always flare ups when the economy starts slowing , " said dr sally .
a slowdown typically brings to the surface the sectors that are already in difficulties .
a slowdown could be the last straw that prompts industry leaders to lobby the government for action .
a string of other industries including lumber , agriculture and cars could begin to press for similar government action if the us slowdown intensifies , says mr hufbauer .

police are still keeping a high profile in harehills west yorkshire police had been out in force to quell any disturbance , with vans full of officers parked in prominent positions .
they said there had been " a couple of minor incidents " but nothing approaching the previous night 's rioting .
bbc correspondent mike thomson said there was " widespread relief " among harehills residents on thursday morning .
but he also said there had been complaints that the police had been too soft on troublemakers on tuesday night .
then two dozen cars and a shop were set on fire and police were pelted with bricks and petrol bombs during the trouble , which lasted for several hours and involved about 200 people .
many locals blame the trouble on outsiders some members of the asian community said tensions had been heightened by the arrest of a local man on sunday .
police have not responded to allegations that officers mistreated him and doused him with cs spray .

the uk would play a key role in any plan for a national missile defence -lrb- nmd -rrb- system to protect the us from " rogue " warheads .
critics say that if us installations at fylingdales and menwith hill in yorkshire were part of the tracking system , the uk would be more vulnerable to attack without gaining any protection .
mr rumsfeld is also likely to broach us troop reductions in the balkans and issues surrounding plans for the european rapid reaction force with nato defence ministers .
proposals for the force have caused controversy in the uk with critics fearing the creation of a parallel " euro army " that will undermine nato .
nato secretary-general lord robertson , formerly uk defence secretary , said in advance of the full consultation on missile defence it was wrong to say europe had offered a lukewarm reaction .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " they -lsb- the us -rsb- have no plans - they are thinking about the issue and therefore there can be no disagreement . "
he said it was widely recognised in europe that there was a need for a rethink on nuclear defence .
balkan troops " do we continue to rely on mutually assured destruction whereby we threaten the annihilation of whole states ? "
lord robertson insisted there was no rift developing over the rapid reaction force with the us recognising the need for a small-scale force to tackle " brush fires in europe 's backyard " .
" i think the americans want more burden-sharing .
" they were aghast ... during the kosovo campaign ... the americans had to provide 85 % of the airpower needed to defeat milosevic . "
and there will be a review of nato troop levels in the balkans , with smaller than expected cuts likely to be announced in force numbers in bosnia .
ahead of the meeting , mr rumsfeld said testing on missile defence would continue .
