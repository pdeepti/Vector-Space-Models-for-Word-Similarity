the two sides have agreed to form a supreme council of afghan leaders which in turn would convene a traditional loya jirga , or grand council .
the loya jirga is a centuries-old institution which brings together representatives of all the main ethnic groups , and is composed of tribal chiefs , intellectuals and religious leaders .
in an apparent move to counter the opposition , the taleban announced that it had reached a power-sharing arrangement with tribal leaders in three southern provinces .
anti-taleban alliance leaders of the opposition northern alliance have been meeting with zahir shah in the former king 's residence in exile , in the italian capital rome .
the king belongs to the pashtun community the former king has been at the centre of international efforts to forge an alliance to replace the taleban .
over the weekend , he met with united states congressmen from both the democrat and republican parties .
on monday , senior us officials quoted by the new york times said president george bush had approved covert efforts to help the opposition , including possible military funding .
" the purpose is to enhance their ability to move against the taleban , " the paper quoted an unidentified us official as saying .
" it is not limited to political support . "
the us sees the 86-year-old former king - who belongs to the largest ethnic group in afghanistan , the pashtuns - as a critical figure in setting up any unity government to replace the afghan regime , which has been sheltering osama bin laden since 1996 .
taleban but in a swift move , the taleban said they would share power with leaders in the khost , paktika and paktia provinces in the south , in an announcement carried by the pakistan-based afghan islamic press .
the opposition is attempting to advance " tribal elders and jihadi commanders or their representatives will be included in the government machinery , " rehmad wahid yar was quoted as saying .
it is the first time the taleban have agreed to any form of power-sharing since they captured kabul in 1996 .
but in a sign of growing pressure on the hardline regime , pakistani president pervez musharraf told the bbc that it appeared the taleban 's days were numbered .
pakistan has been the taleban 's strongest supporter and is the only country to still maintain diplomatic ties with afghanistan .
the opposition northern alliance holds about 10 % of afghan territory .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- swissair accepts rescue plan categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 2 october , 2001 , 04:40 gmt 05:40 uk swissair accepts rescue plan swissair was already in trouble before the 11 september attacks swissair has accepted a partial rescue bid by two banks , in a last-minute attempt to avoid total bankruptcy .
under the deal , swissair 's flight operations will be taken over by its regional subsidiary crossair , while other parts of the group will seek bankruptcy protection .
swissair chairman and chief executive mario corti emerged from crisis talks on monday to say the airline would sell the 70 % stake it currently holds in crossair to swiss banks ubs and credit suisse .
mr corti blamed the suicide airliner attacks in the us on 11 september for causing billions of swiss francs in costs for the cash-strapped group .
but the company was already struggling under a mountain of debt caused by a failed expansion strategy , before the us tragedy .
flight operations saved the banks ' offer , of 1.36bn swiss francs -lrb- £ 569m ; $ 840m -rrb- , only applies to swissair 's flight operations .
non-flight operations including catering , airport retailing and ground services are in line for the chop , jeopardising thousands of jobs and rendering swissair stock virtually worthless .
mr corti said there was likely to be 2,560 job cuts , 1,750 of them in switzerland , and sairgroup and the sairlines and flightlease divisions would seek creditor protection .
the combined swissair / crossair fleet will be reduced by 24 aircraft , the chief executive of crossair and head of newly-formed swiss airlines , andre dose said on monday .
he said the long-haul fleet would be reduced to 26 aircraft from 35 , while the european fleet would be scaled back to 26 jets from 41 .
' no alternative ' the deal saves switzerland 's banks from accusations that they allowed one of the country 's most high-profile businesses to go out of business , analysts said .
" i do not think there is much of an alternative under current circumstances , " nicholas van den brul , airline industry analyst at bnp paribas in london said .
switzerland 's federal government - which holds a 3 % stake in swissair - said it will not take a stake in the new airline .
" an intervention of the -lrb- swiss -rrb- confederation is not necessary , " said swiss vice president kaspar villiger .
" the creation of a new company is the best solution for the future under the given circumstances . "
but credit suisse still wants the federal and regional governments to take up a 30 % stake in the new crossair .
guaranteeing flights earlier on monday , swissair said it was unable to guarantee flights for the rest of the week .
callers to the swissair booking line were told the carrier could not confirm that passengers with flights booked this week would be able to fly .
but booking agents said swissair hopes to be able to provide its scheduled service and advised passengers against making alternative bookings with other airlines .
swissair hopes to provide more information tuesday , callers were told .
sabena repercussions the rescue deal will have serious repercussions for belgium 's troubled national carrier sabena , which swissair jointly owns with the belgian government .
the airline made a record loss last year sabena grounded more than a quarter of its flights on monday as a pilots ' strike went into a fourth day in protest against plans to restructure the ailing belgian airline .
swissair said it was incapable of injecting around 200m swiss francs into sabena this week , as agreed under a rescue plan with the belgian government .
in a reply to a question on whether it was right to assume that the payment had not been made , mr corti said : " that assumption is correct . "
both the belgian state - which said swissair 's decision was a " flagrant violation " of pre-existing agreements - and sabena said they could go to court if swissair does not live up to the agreement .
mr corti said payments of more than 100m francs due to former french partner airline air littoral could also not be made .
" the payments to france have the same status as the payments to belgium , " he said .
in brussels , sabena said it would continue its operations .

the last three months have been extremely painful for equity investors , with the 11 september terrorist attacks on the us making matters worse .
few analysts expect the situation in the markets to improve soon .
in the us , the blue-chip new york stock exchange wrapped up its worst quarter since 1987 .
while its hi-tech rival nasdaq fared even worse , ending the third quarter of 2001 30 % lower than it started , thereby recording its worst quarter in history .
the first two days of the new quarter saw markets in asia fall back , as dealers rushed to take profits from the slim gains made last week .
by lunchtime on 2 october , the nikkei 225 in tokyo was down 45.41 points at 9,926.87 , having made some gains the day before .
combating recession the fortunes of us companies have tumbled throughout 2001 , despite serious efforts by the us authorities to fend off a recession .
the us economic slowdown has spread fast across the world .
many wall street professionals believe the us , japan and other parts of the world are in a recession already .
if so , the us economy has hit the rocks despite generous tax cuts and eight previous interest rate reductions .
these measures are now expected to be followed up with a ninth cut in rates on tuesday and a government economic stimulus package that , according to the us treasury , could be announced within days .
however , it is far from clear whether any added stimulus would come in the form of further tax cuts or a spending package aimed at pump-priming the economy ; treasury spokeswoman michele davis declined to elaborate .
changing fortunes when tax cut promises were first made by president george w bush during his election campaign , they were not aimed at preventing an economic slump .
on the contrary , at the time he told the american people that things were good so it was about time to hand something back to those who had made it so .
in february 2000 , he argued that it was a matter of dividing the spoils to celebrate the longest economic expansion in american history .
by february 2001 , america 's economic fortunes had turned and mr bush had changed his tune .
then his argument for tax cuts was that the slowing us economy needed a jolt from the government .
" tax relief is right , and tax relief is urgent .
the long economic expansion that began almost ten years ago is faltering , " he said at the time .
us stock markets the nasdaq index , which is heavily loaded with shares in high technology companies , fell more than 30 % during the third quarter of 2001 , its second worst quarter in history .
the nasdaq fell 1.22 % or 18.36 points on monday to close at 1,480.44 .

the last three months have been extremely painful for equity investors , with the 11 september terrorist attacks on the us making matters worse .
few analysts expect the situation in the markets to improve soon .
in the us , the blue-chip new york stock exchange wrapped up its worst quarter since 1987 .
while its hi-tech rival nasdaq fared even worse , ending the third quarter of 2001 30 % lower than it started , thereby recording its worst quarter in history .
the first two days of the new quarter saw markets in asia fall back , as dealers rushed to take profits from the slim gains made last week .
by lunchtime on 2 october , the nikkei 225 in tokyo was down 45.41 points at 9,926.87 , having made some gains the day before .
combating recession the fortunes of us companies have tumbled throughout 2001 , despite serious efforts by the us authorities to fend off a recession .
the us economic slowdown has spread fast across the world .
many wall street professionals believe the us , japan and other parts of the world are in a recession already .
if so , the us economy has hit the rocks despite generous tax cuts and eight previous interest rate reductions .
these measures are now expected to be followed up with a ninth cut in rates on tuesday and a government economic stimulus package that , according to the us treasury , could be announced within days .
however , it is far from clear whether any added stimulus would come in the form of further tax cuts or a spending package aimed at pump-priming the economy ; treasury spokeswoman michele davis declined to elaborate .
changing fortunes when tax cut promises were first made by president george w bush during his election campaign , they were not aimed at preventing an economic slump .
on the contrary , at the time he told the american people that things were good so it was about time to hand something back to those who had made it so .
in february 2000 , he argued that it was a matter of dividing the spoils to celebrate the longest economic expansion in american history .
by february 2001 , america 's economic fortunes had turned and mr bush had changed his tune .
then his argument for tax cuts was that the slowing us economy needed a jolt from the government .
" tax relief is right , and tax relief is urgent .
the long economic expansion that began almost ten years ago is faltering , " he said at the time .
us stock markets the nasdaq index , which is heavily loaded with shares in high technology companies , fell more than 30 % during the third quarter of 2001 , its second worst quarter in history .
the nasdaq fell 1.22 % or 18.36 points on monday to close at 1,480.44 .

if the deal comes off as expected on 2 october , it will represent the first piece of good news for the aviation industry since the decimation triggered by the 11 september attacks on the us .
the industry was already struggling with overcapacity , and was looking at massive cutbacks .
but the use of passenger jets to damage the pentagon and destroy the world trade center has catalysed a wave of layoffs among both airlines and aeroplane manufacturers .
boeing alone is cutting 20-30,000 jobs , while well over 100,000 jobs have gone among the world 's airlines and europe 's swissair has had to seek bankruptcy protection .
us airlines are warning that they , too , will have to seek chapter 11 protection , a form of bankruptcy which wards off a company 's creditors while it tries to restructure .
and on 1 october the us 's two biggest airlines , american and continental , said traffic fell more than 30 % in september .
wait and see boeing 's deal is not yet final , a boeing spokesman stressed .
while chinese and us government officials are expected to attend a signing ceremony on 2 october , boeing 's bob saling said : " there is still not a firm order . "
negotiations have been going on for months , and before 11 september the deal was thought to be worth perhaps $ 2bn for up to 36 aircraft .
" our relationship is one that is very strong with the chinese , " mr saling said , " but we have learned that patience is a virtuous thing in our dealings with china . "
the deal could be a significant foot in the door for boeing .
the airline has estimated that china is going to need over 1,700 commercial jets by 2020 at a cost of about $ 144bn .
government help us airlines have already won $ 15bn in assistance from the federal government , of which $ 5bn is in grants and $ 10bn in loans .
european governments and the european commission are concentrating on assisting with increased insurance premiums , since eu law expressly prohibits individual governments from aiding their aviation industries directly .
