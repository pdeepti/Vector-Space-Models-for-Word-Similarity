president castro stayed in cuba the cuban president , fidel castro , was absent from the forum - the 11th such ibero-american summit - which was held this year in the peruvian capital of lima for the first time .
he stayed in cuba to lead reconstruction efforts after the devastation caused by hurricane michelle earlier this month .
at last year 's summit in panama , mr castro - whose country is blacklisted by the united states as an alleged sponsor of terrorism - refused to sign an anti-terrorism motion .

peruvian economy minister pedro pablo kuczynski said a new international financial aid package for argentina was being considered , and that latin american countries agreed they should contribute .
" that would be a positive signal to the international community that latin america no only asks for help , but also grants help , " he said .
other documents signed by the leaders at a ceremony in peru 's government palace included praise for peru and nicaragua for clean elections , and a call for britain and argentina to settle a sovereignty dispute over the falkland islands .

internet users do not deserve their reputation for being socially inadequate loners , a study has found .
despite jibes that computer users meet their friends online , researchers say they are actually more likely to be sociable and community minded .
professor andrew oswald and dr jonathan gardner , from the university of warwick , uk , found that people who regularly used the internet were also more likely to be better educated and to earn more .
it appears the web is helping to strengthen the quality of british society professor andrew oswald professor oswald told the bbc : " this research should be very useful in overturning some common stereotypes .
" we discovered internet users are better citizens and more likely to be members of community groups and voluntary organisations .
" it appears the web is helping to strengthen the quality of british society .
internet users are the best citizens not the worst . "
the professors concluded that internet users were sociable after discovering that 30 % belonged to a community group , compared with less than a quarter of non-users .
people who went online regularly were also 50 % more likely to be regular church-goers and were more trusting than average .
graduates online the amount of time spent on the internet was also a good indicator of earnings .
almost two-thirds of people taking home more than £ 32,000 a year use the internet , compared with just 9 % of those earning between £ 6,000 and £ 12,000 .
more than seven out of 10 graduates use the web , but only one in 10 people with no qualifications do so .
the study also discovered that 40 % of men use the internet , compared with 28 % of women .
men spent an average of 3.5 hours a week online , compared with 2.5 hours for women .
the findings will be published later this week in the 18th british social attitudes report .

trial results will be presented to the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation -lrb- jcvi -rrb- , which advises the government .
a department of health spokesman said the research into the vaccine was an " interesting step " .
he added : " if it is recommended by the committee then it would be considered for introduction " .

trials of a vaccine against all sub-strains of the meningococcal b strain are taking place in belgium , and could lead to the vaccine being available by 2005 .

our view is that we are dealing with the arabs in a humanitarian and islamic basis .
they should not have concern burhanuddin rabbani ousted afghan president afghan taleban fighters who surrendered would be allowed to return to their homes and foreigners would be treated as prisoners of war under the geneva convention , mr rabbani told a news conference in the capital kabul .
a great fear of the western coalition has been the threat of an impending blood-bath in the besieged city of kunduz .
with foreign fighters there convinced they will be murdered if they do not fight their way out , there was little room to negotiate a surrender .
affordable generosity but mr rabbani said allegations that his forces wanted to kill the foreigners were baseless .
he said the fighters would be " investigated " and then handed over to the un for repatriation - and this , despite an incident in which some arab prisoners reportedly blew themselves and one senior alliance commander up with a hidden grenade .
he also spoke of the un-sponsored conference in germany to discuss a broad-based interim government .
perhaps alarmingly for the un , mr rabbani repeatedly referred to the alliance as the islamic state of afghanistan - the name that referred to the government he led before the taleban ousted him in 1996 .
he said that , while the taleban would not be allowed to take part in any interim government as an organisation , former taleban officials might participate as individuals .
but mr rabbani can afford to be generous .
the state , he said , would hold 11 of the 20 seats at the conference in bonn , giving it clear control over the agenda .
