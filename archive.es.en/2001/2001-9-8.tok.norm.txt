they finally put on record in an international document the full enormity of the slave trade , and confirmed that the world owes the victims of that trade support and help , to restore their dignity and repair the damage slavery did .
but as well as this historic declaration , the documents are full of detailed practical recommendations for combating racism .
they endorse the principles that cultural diversity should be valued and supported , that the children of minority groups should be educated in their own language and their own culture .
there are places in the world where this would mean a radical change of official policy .
they urge countries to tackle racism in their criminal justice systems , not least by keeping full statistics which show up inequalities and discrimination .
last-minute wrangle they address the currently vexed question of migrants and asylum-seekers , enshrining the principle that countries should not discriminate between them on grounds of race .
but all this work was almost lost on the last day of the conference because of a last-minute wrangle between arab countries and europe over three apparently insignificant paragraphs .
they were not part of the main section on the middle east - indeed they did not name israel and palestine at all .
but they mentioned colonisation by settlers and foreign occupation as a source of racism , and could have been construed as criticism of israel .
forced to vote the final meeting of the main committee went into an interminable wrangle about rulings and motions and points of procedure , as staff began to leave , and workmen dismantled the facilities and began clearing the conference complex .
in order to close the meeting at all the matter was forced to full vote - something the un hates .
an adjournment was approved and the closing ceremony could begin , but the price was a feeling that full discussion had been stifled .
good intentions at the moment few people who were here in durban are fully satisfied .
the african group never got the clear apology for slavery it wanted from the descendants of those who profited .
the arab group did not get the platform they wanted to make their points about israel .
and europe did not quite escape the notion that it was up to them to make reparations for the past .
the true test of this meeting will only come when some time has passed , the passions have cooled and it can be seen whether the good intentions of the final resolutions will make a real difference in practice .

the australian foreign minister , alexander downer , said the government 's actions showed its determination to crack down on people-smuggling .
he was speaking after the australian navy intercepted a boat carrying more than 200 asylum-seekers off its north-west coast .
at no stage did this latest vessel reach australian territorial waters .
as a result questions of application for asylum status do not arise prime minister john howard the migrants were taken off their boat on friday night and put on the hmas manoora , the australian troop ship already carrying more than 400 mainly afghan asylum-seekers involved in a diplomatic stand-off near christmas island .
australia was criticised internationally for the way it treated the first group of migrants - preventing them from coming ashore on christmas island .
tough legislation but prime minister john howard has vowed to introduce legislation to tighten australia 's migration laws .
if approved , people would have to reach the australian mainland rather than outlying islands before they could apply for refugee status .
click here for map mr howard said the latest boat was intercepted in international waters after it refused to stop .
" at no stage did this latest vessel reach australian territorial waters .
as a result questions of application for asylum status do not arise , " he said .
howard wants to change migration laws the bali-registered boat was carrying 237 people , including 92 women .
it was spotted by a coastal patrol aircraft and stopped off ashmore island , a small australian territory in the timor sea , closer to indonesia than australia .
" following warnings to turn around ... the vessel was subsequently boarded as a stateless vessel without a flag , " the prime minister said .
the manoora is continuing to papua new guinea , where it is expected in the capital port moresby early next week .
new policy on islands mr howard said the new legislation would affect people reaching christmas island and ashmore island .
he said the two places would be taken out of the australian migration zone so that anyone arriving there would no longer be able to apply for refugee status .
mr howard 's hard line against the 400 afghan refugees won him widespread public backing in australia , which is expected to hold elections later this year .
mr howard said australia asked indonesia to stop the boat while it was in indonesian waters , but the request was turned down .
on friday , a delegation of australian ministers failed to reach agreement in jakarta on dealing with boats of asylum-seekers , which australia describes as people-smuggling .
the original asylum-seekers on board the manoora were put there after a norwegian freighter which had picked them up was refused permission to land them at christmas island .
mr howard instead brokered a deal whereby they will be taken from papua new guinea to new zealand and nauru , where their asylum claims will be assessed .
it is not clear if the new refugees will be included in the original deal .
new zealand prime minister helen clark said her country , which volunteered to take 150 of the original asylum seekers , would not take any more .
" we will not be taking any more than we have indicated , " a spokesman told reuters news agency .

but now britain is one of the launch pads for a new wave of brazilian music which brings together the undulating , summery sounds of rio rhythm with the contemporary feel of drum loops and electronics .
this musical movement - which , for want of a better term , is often called " nova bossa nova " - has led to a renewed interest in a clutch of brazilian artists who have been all but forgotten in brazil .
singer bebel gilberto - whose father joão virtually invented the original bossa nova in the late 1950s - exemplifies the paradoxes of the new movement .
her album tanto tempo has sold nearly 400,000 copies since its release last year , but only 20,000 of this total in brazil .
roots on tanto tempo , gilberto collaborates with the british group smoke city , whose brazilian flavoured jingle for a 1997 levi 's commercial was one of the first signs of the new music breaking cover .
but the roots of the new wave go back to london clubland in the late 1980s .
joe davis , whose london record label far out has released some of the major nova bossa nova records , was a dj at the time .
" i used to be a dj in acid jazz clubs alongside people like gilles peterson and we started playing brazilian music in these clubs , " he told bbc news online .
' niche ' " people would ask me what these tracks were - next thing i 'm going to brazil ten times a year to buy records and sell them to djs back here .
" i finally got bored of doing that and by then i 'd met a lot of artists and brought them over for shows - i saw a niche to do some classic but contemporary brazilian music here . "
the far out stable includes marcos valle and joyce , both of whose careers had been languishing in brazil until they were rediscovered in europe .
joyce 's new album gafieira moderna even includes a song about the manchester jazz club band on the wall - one of her favourite venues .
another important label is belgian-based ziriguiboom , which records bebel gilberto , bossacucanova and zuco 103 .
chemistry ziriguiboom releases often focus on the marriage between brazilian and electronic rhythms , sometimes matching classic bossa nova songs from the 1950s with contemporary backing tracks .
it can be an effective combination - but the chemistry is delicate , according to joe davis : " brazilian music has its own swing and i find it frustrating when dance producers use these rhythms in completely the wrong way and put a great big , banging beat over the top . "
watching developments in britain with interest is vicente lou , editor of london brazilian monthly leros .

" funnily enough , these artists are hardly known in brazil - they do n't appeal to brazilians because they 're revisiting a style which is classic but brazilians are obsessed with novelty . "
so while brazil remains an extremely fertile breeding ground for new musical styles , it is in europe that some of the classic music of the past is being rejuvenated by contemporary sounds and production .
in today 's pop era of heavy beats , rasping raps and tough images it seems that the sinuous melodies and clever harmonies of brazil still have an enduring appeal .

electronic paper has been one of the technology world 's holy grails for more than two decades and the prospect of using it as a substitute for the real thing is closer than ever .
communication by way of the printed word has been a fact of life for centuries .
and even though modern communication has come a long way , paper is still ubiquitous .
over the past couple of decades the technology world has been searching for a way to manufacture electronic ink and paper .
electrical charges two american companies seem to have cracked the problem .
gyricon media and the e-ink corporation have developed similar minute capsules , filled with a dark solution and laden with white particles .
the idea is that when an electrical charge is applied , the particles will move from one side of the capsule to the other , thereby creating a dark or white patch .
" we 've got three unique items here , " e-ink 's director of technology , dr paul drzaic told click online .
" we 've the electronic ink material which is the part that 's flashing black and white .
we 've got plastic electronics which is controlling the e-ink and telling it what image to put on and we 've put them together to work on this flexible plastic sheet . "
" this is really ground-breaking stuff because this is the first time e-ink has been proven to work with plastic electronics on a flexible display and this is an important first step in our vision of what an electronic paper product could look like in the future . "
in-store displays the first commercial application for this technology has been through the development of electronic signs such as in-store displays connected via a wireless link .
we have to treat each development cautiously .
i do n't think we want to jump in with both feet jeremy ettinghausen , penguin e-book editor the message on any or all of the signs can be changed remotely simply at the push of a button .
" that 's just the beginning , " says chief scientist at xerox , john seely brown .
" you can actually think about there being a book now because you can actually put some electronics on the back of this thing and it becomes a display .
and you can build an entire book out of this material . "
caution and excitement but the publishing world is undecided about e-paper .
even publishers who are moving into the hi-tech arena with e-books reserve judgement on e-paper .
" we have to treat each development cautiously .

electronic paper has been one of the technology world 's holy grails for more than two decades and the prospect of using it as a substitute for the real thing is closer than ever .
communication by way of the printed word has been a fact of life for centuries .
and even though modern communication has come a long way , paper is still ubiquitous .
over the past couple of decades the technology world has been searching for a way to manufacture electronic ink and paper .
electrical charges two american companies seem to have cracked the problem .
gyricon media and the e-ink corporation have developed similar minute capsules , filled with a dark solution and laden with white particles .
e-paper now shows promise the idea is that when an electrical charge is applied , the particles will move from one side of the capsule to the other , thereby creating a dark or white patch .
" we 've got three unique items here , " e-ink 's director of technology , dr paul drzaic told click online .
" we 've the electronic ink material which is the part that 's flashing black and white .
we 've got plastic electronics which is controlling the e-ink and telling it what image to put on and we 've put them together to work on this flexible plastic sheet . "
" this is really ground-breaking stuff because this is the first time e-ink has been proven to work with plastic electronics on a flexible display and this is an important first step in our vision of what an electronic paper product could look like in the future . "
in-store displays the first commercial application for this technology has been through the development of electronic signs such as in-store displays connected via a wireless link .
we have to treat each development cautiously .
i do n't think we want to jump in with both feet jeremy ettinghausen , penguin e-book editor the message on any or all of the signs can be changed remotely simply at the push of a button .
" that 's just the beginning , " says chief scientist at xerox , john seely brown .
" you can actually think about there being a book now because you can actually put some electronics on the back of this thing and it becomes a display .
and you can build an entire book out of this material . "
caution and excitement but the publishing world is undecided about e-paper .
even publishers who are moving into the hi-tech arena with e-books reserve judgement on e-paper .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- sa land reform frustration builds categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : africa front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 8 september , 2001 , 09:29 gmt 10:29 uk sa land reform frustration builds for those in overcrowded conditions unused land is tempting by the bbc 's alex van wel the agreement on zimbabwe land redistribution at the commonwealth meeting in abuja will have been closely followed in south africa .
some people are also resentful at what they see as a failure to address the link between racism and landlessness at the world conference in durban .
mbeki 's government has taken a tough stance on squatters and their presence in durban reflects a new radicalism that has emerged in south africa in the form of the landless people 's movement , a coalition of ngos concerned about the slow pace of land reform .
" power to the people " was the cry from members of the landless people 's assembly , a gathering of more than 3000 dispossessed on the fringe of durban 's racism conference .
slow moving when the african national congress -lrb- anc -rrb- came to power seven years ago , 13 % of the land was in the hands of black people , who make up 80 % of the population .
zeiks slatiswaya , director of the national land committee says only 2 % has been redistributed .
" i do n't want to be a prophet of doom , but we have said before , in 1994 , that unless the government fast-tracks land reform , we are likely to get re-occupations and land occupations , " said mr slatiswaya .
" that was long before zimbabwe , and we 're beginning to see that happening , " he warned .
there have already been occupations of land at brudel near johannesburg , in the cape and in kwazulu natal .
but unlike zimbabwe , the south african government has dealt firmly with illegal occupations , forcibly removing squatters from brudel .
at the same time it says it is doing what it can to bring about land reform through a number of processes .
land ' restitution ' the most controversial of these is restitution , aiming to return land to those who can show they previously owned it .
but that has been extremely slow in implementation .
the land affairs minister , thoko didiza , told me it was a question of balancing different interests .
i want my land back , and the government is not doing that .
the government wo n't even negotiate on our behalf south african farmer " the way in which a government interacts with its society must also bear in mind the need of agencies , while at the same time you ensure that you work within the framework - that you do n't solve one problem and create another and instability on the other , " she said .
but for people like randall rouseau this explanation offers little comfort .
his father had his land in the eastern cape taken away by a white farmer during the apartheid years .
now , more than seven years after the end of the regime , randall is still fighting to recover his family property .
" i 'm angry at the process , because we try to talk to government to speed up the process .
and i can assure you that i do n't want to invade , but we can negotiate , " he said .
" but i want my land back , and the government is not doing that .
the government wo n't even negotiate on our behalf . "
white land-owners ' fear the landless people have been singing in perfect harmony in durban but their message sends discord through the white land-owning class .
there has been widespread looting of white farms in zimbabwe they worry that although the government may now be willing to uphold their property rights , the pressure for reform might lead south africa to follow the path of zimbabwe , where there have been land invasions on a massive scale .
peter stockhill farms in the drakensburg mountains of northern kwa zulu natal .
he says he is in favour of redistributing land .
" probably 80 % of the farmers out there would welcome an african farmer neighbour to farm the farm next door .
zimbabwe 's lessons south africa 's landowners know they will have to accept change as the country moves further down the road towards an equal society .
for them , zimbabwe 's experience is a sober reminder of what might happen if the government fails to bring about proper reform .
for the landless it brings hope that the redistribution may become a reality .
