the countryside agency 's findings conclude that lottery funding has played a major role in the improvements , but it says more money is needed to provide a full range of services in rural areas .
it found that more than 500 rural post offices shut down between 1997 and 2000 and warns more closures are likely .
the survey results suggest one in every 15 rural households is more than two kilometres away from a post office .
we are worried about the vulnerability of these services , especially in smaller settlements pam warhurst , countryside agency in urban areas , nearly all households are within two kilometres of postal services .
the agency 's rural services in 2000 report notes a significant improvement in bus timetables .
in 1997 , public transport hit an all-time low , with only six out of 10 parishes receiving a six or seven day a week bus service .
the 2000 survey highlights an improvement , with 67 % of parishes provided with a bus service .
there are also more community meeting places .
throughout the 1990s , about 70 % of parishes had a village hall or meeting place , but last year this had risen to 85 % with help from lottery funding .
rural white paper deputy chair of the countryside agency , pam warhurst , said : " the challenge in providing quality rural services is a wide one .
" we are worried about the vulnerability of these services , especially in smaller settlements .
" the current pressures on the post office and doubts about the future of the universal bank could lead to further closures , despite the government 's commitment to maintain the rural network .
many rural post offices have closed " we continue to look for new ways to deliver services in rural areas , in particular through our market towns and vital villages initiatives .
" but if the government is to meet its own commitment to rural service standards in its rural white paper , better public services for rural people and businesses will need additional investment . "
the survey found more than seven out of 10 country settlements do not have a general store or village shop .
but 80 % of rural households live within four kilometres of a supermarket .
other findings from the report show : nine out of 10 rural households live within two kilometres of a primary school more than eight out of 10 live within four kilometres of a doctor 's surgery nearly 90 % of rural households live within four kilometres of a petrol station more than half of all rural settlements do not have a pub watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jane warr " the countryside agency is looking for new ways to work together with local authorities and businesses " more from leicester see also : 18 apr 00 -pipe- uk politics ailing post offices offered lifeline 12 apr 00 -pipe- uk politics ' post office must modernise ' 28 mar 00 -pipe- uk politics blair ' 100 % behind ' public post office 15 feb 00 -pipe- uk politics lifeline for village post offices 28 jan 00 -pipe- uk politics post office to become plc internet links : countryside agency consignia the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories now : postcode lottery in gp services leanne killer jailed for life tories attack brixton drugs scheme straw defends arms sales change ivf mix-up heads for court police shoot man on the m6 new challenge excites venables judge urges life sentence shake-up links to more uk stories are at the foot of the page .

the countryside agency 's findings conclude that lottery funding has played a major role in the improvements , but it says more money is needed to provide a full range of services in rural areas .
it found that more than 500 rural post offices shut down between 1997 and 2000 and warns more closures are likely .
the survey results suggest one in every 15 rural households is more than two kilometres away from a post office .
we are worried about the vulnerability of these services , especially in smaller settlements pam warhurst , countryside agency in urban areas , nearly all households are within two kilometres of postal services .
the agency 's rural services in 2000 report notes a significant improvement in bus timetables .
in 1997 , public transport hit an all-time low , with only six out of 10 parishes receiving a six or seven day a week bus service .
the 2000 survey highlights an improvement , with 67 % of parishes provided with a bus service .
there are also more community meeting places .
throughout the 1990s , about 70 % of parishes had a village hall or meeting place , but last year this had risen to 85 % with help from lottery funding .
rural white paper deputy chair of the countryside agency , pam warhurst , said : " the challenge in providing quality rural services is a wide one .
" we are worried about the vulnerability of these services , especially in smaller settlements .
" the current pressures on the post office and doubts about the future of the universal bank could lead to further closures , despite the government 's commitment to maintain the rural network .
" we continue to look for new ways to deliver services in rural areas , in particular through our market towns and vital villages initiatives .
" but if the government is to meet its own commitment to rural service standards in its rural white paper , better public services for rural people and businesses will need additional investment . "
the survey found more than seven out of 10 country settlements do not have a general store or village shop .
but 80 % of rural households live within four kilometres of a supermarket .
other findings from the report show : nine out of 10 rural households live within two kilometres of a primary school more than eight out of 10 live within four kilometres of a doctor 's surgery nearly 90 % of rural households live within four kilometres of a petrol station more than half of all rural settlements do not have a pub related to this story : ailing post offices offered lifeline -lrb- 18 apr 00 -pipe- uk politics -rrb- ' post office must modernise ' -lrb- 12 apr 00 -pipe- uk politics -rrb- blair ' 100 % behind ' public post office -lrb- 28 mar 00 -pipe- uk politics -rrb- lifeline for village post offices -lrb- 15 feb 00 -pipe- uk politics -rrb- post office to become plc -lrb- 28 jan 00 -pipe- uk politics -rrb- internet links : countryside agency -pipe- consignia -pipe- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- ©

a state department spokesman said nicaraguans had demonstrated an " unwavering commitment to democracy " .
mr ortega , leader of nicaragua 's sandinista party , accused the us - his old enemy - of backing a " dirty campaign " to stop his return to power .
with slightly more than 13 % of the vote counted , mr bolanos , of the ruling constitutional liberal party , had a nine-point lead over mr ortega 's sandinista national liberation front .
" we accept the mandate of the people and congratulate the liberal ticket , " mr ortega said in a concession speech , but added : " there was very strong interference from external forces that undoubtedly led to polarisation . "
mr bolanos told a crowd of cheering supporters : " as of now i give up the red flag -lrb- of the constitutional liberal party -rrb- and pick up the blue and white one of nicaragua because now i am the president of all nicaraguans . "
he praised mr ortega for conceding peacefully , saying : " nicaragua is the winner in this episode . "
jubilant supporters of mr bolanos taunted mr ortega 's third consecutive election defeat using a baseball metaphor .
" strike out ! strike out ! " they chanted .
security tight us state department spokesman richard boucher congratulated mr bolanos on his victory .
" we are confident that mr bolanos 's lifelong commitment to democracy , his integrity and courage as well as his extensive experience as a businessman will help nicaragua address the serious challenges that lie ahead , " he said .
mr boucher , who had openly expressed reservations about mr ortega 's suitability for the presidency , nonetheless commended the sandinista party for conducting a " dignified " campaign and conceding defeat .
we will support the governability of the country from our position as an opposition force daniel ortega election organisers struggled to cope with the enormous turnout and some voters were still queuing at polling stations more than five hours after the polls were scheduled to close .
on election day - sunday - few problems or irregularities were reported despite earlier fears of trouble .
soldiers and police were out in force on the streets of the capital managua throughout the weekend , and polling stations were under heavy guard .
mr bolanos , who was vice president to outgoing president arnoldo aleman , inherits a struggling economy .
when the sandinistas came to power in a revolution in 1979 , he was imprisoned and had his assets seized .
rhetoric abandoned while in power , mr ortega had tried to introduce revolutionary reforms in land ownership , economic and social policies .
but he also had to fight a bitter military campaign against us-backed contra rebels and gradually lost popular support .
he was ousted in a 1990 election and lost again six years later , both times at the hands of us-backed candidates .
for this election he adopted a softer image , wearing pink shirts instead of combat fatigues and used the slogan : " love is stronger than hate . "
but the us made no secret of its desire to see him defeated again .
state department officials claimed he had links with supporters of terrorism , apparently references to mr ortega 's previous ties with libya 's colonel gaddafi and iraq 's saddam hussein .
" fear was used , a dirty campaign was employed , a terror campaign was used , " said mr ortega on monday .

the change is likely to be announced at a cabinet meeting on wednesday , according to taiwan press reports .
taiwan 's president , chen shui-bian , will unveil a new stance of " aggressive opening and pragmatic controls " towards china .
the new , vigorous approach ditches the 5-year -old policy of " no haste , be patient " introduced by president chen 's predecessor during tensions with the mainland in 1996 .
' within days ' president chen shui-bian said on 4 november that he was intending to announce a major policy shift within a couple of days .
he was speaking at an election rally for the 1 december vote for the legislative assembly .
a cross-party presidential advisory committee suggested easing investment policy towards the mainland in the summer , since when taiwan 's recession has got grimmer .
the committee also urged the cabinet to consider restoring direct transport , commercial and postal links with the mainland for the first time since 1949 .
investment cap to go ?
the measures likely to be unveiled this week include easing restrictions on investment and on doing business with mainland banks , according to reports in taiwan newspapers .
an investment cap setting a limit of $ 50m per investment is likely to be abolished .
offshore banking units of domestic banks could be allowed carry out direct dealings with mainland financial institutions .
this would reduce the complexity of arrangments for routing funds to china through another territory , which is usually hong kong .
from boom to bust ?
the investment limits were imposed in 1996 by then-president lee teng-hui to try to ensure investment went into building up taiwan 's own economic base .
the ongoing global slowdown has hit taiwan hard , with unemployment hitting record highs and hi-tech exports slumping .
china and taiwan are both expected to be welcomed into the world trade organisation at its ministerial summit in doha , qatar within a few days .
china 's entry into the wto will bring wide-ranging market access agreements with all the wto 's 142 other members .

a fleet of japanese ships is set to leave the western port of shimonoseki on a six-month hunting expedition for the whales .
japan 's assertions that this whaling is necessary for scientific research purposes are unfounded new zealand conservation minister sandra lee japan gave up commercial whaling following an international moratorium declared by the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in 1986 .
but it has been catching hundreds of minke whales for scientific research since 1987 , saying the hunts provide information on whale feeding habits and migration patterns .
environmental groups , however , have charged that some of the whale meat finds its way to japan 's restaurants , where it is served as a delicacy .
' despicable ' new zealand has joined in the condemnation , calling japan 's policy " despicable " .
" japan 's assertions that this whaling is necessary for scientific research purposes are unfounded , " said new zealand conservation minister sandra lee .
norway also wants commercial whaling " i deeply regret this decision and once again call on japan to stop this despicable move , " ms lee said .
she added that the iwc had repeatedly called on japan to stop its lethal project , which has killed more than 5,000 minke whales in 12 years .
new zealand is among several states trying to create a sanctuary for whales in the southern hemisphere .
takanori nagamoto of japan 's fisheries agency said on monday that japan conducted research hunts twice a year .
stocks dispute last may and june , japan carried out a research excursion in the northwest pacific .
whale meat is a delicacy in japan this expedition will be in antarctica , where there are believed to be about 760,000 minke whales .
the iwc is scheduled to meet next may in shimonoseki .
there , japan , norway and other pro-whaling nations are expected to argue that whale stocks are strong enough in many regions to allow a resumption of limited industrial hunts .
ms lee rejected this and said : " there are strong indications that -lsb- minke whale -rsb- numbers may be in decline . "

japan 's assertions that this whaling is necessary for scientific research purposes are unfounded new zealand conservation minister sandra lee japan gave up commercial whaling following an international moratorium declared by the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- in 1986 .
but it has been catching hundreds of minke whales for scientific research since 1987 , saying the hunts provide information on whale feeding habits and migration patterns .
environmental groups , however , have charged that some of the whale meat finds its way to japan 's restaurants , where it is served as a delicacy .
' despicable ' new zealand has joined in the condemnation , calling japan 's policy " despicable " .
" japan 's assertions that this whaling is necessary for scientific research purposes are unfounded , " said new zealand conservation minister sandra lee .
" i deeply regret this decision and once again call on japan to stop this despicable move , " ms lee said .
she added that the iwc had repeatedly called on japan to stop its lethal project , which has killed more than 5,000 minke whales in 12 years .
new zealand is among several states trying to create a sanctuary for whales in the southern hemisphere .
takanori nagamoto of japan 's fisheries agency said on monday that japan conducted research hunts twice a year .
stocks dispute last may and june , japan carried out a research excursion in the northwest pacific .
this expedition will be in antarctica , where there are believed to be about 760,000 minke whales .
the iwc is scheduled to meet next may in shimonoseki .
there , japan , norway and other pro-whaling nations are expected to argue that whale stocks are strong enough in many regions to allow a resumption of limited industrial hunts .
ms lee rejected this and said : " there are strong indications that -lsb- minke whale -rsb- numbers may be in decline . "

the cabinet is widely expected to cut its overall growth forecast for the economy later this week .
the bank of japan has already downgraded its forecast , acknowledging the economy will shrink by between 0.9 % and 1.2 % in the fiscal year to march 2001 .
in doing so , it said consumer prices would likely fall by up to 1.1 % in the year to march 2002 , giving steeper-than-expected deflation .
in september this year , overall household spending in japan fell 3.7 % in real terms compared to the same month last year , according to official figures .
measured across the three months from july to september , household spending was down 2.1 % in real terms and a seasonally adjusted 0.9 % on year-earlier .

the ability to be a hacker is now being mass-marketed in a product called keykatcher .
it is a small , cream-coloured tubular device that tracks and stores all the keystrokes a person enters into keykatcher 's memory chip .
this means it can be used to find out everything a person types into their computer , including personal letters , business correspondence , passwords and credit card numbers .
click here to tell us what you would use the keykatcher for it is relatively cheap , costing between us $ 50 and $ 150 , and can be purchased throughout europe and the us , as well as online .
easy to install if you want to install it , simply plug the device in between the keyboard cable and the computer .
device is plugged in between the keyboard cable and the computer it will then record all the information someone taps into the computer through the keyboard .
to recover this data , you type in a previously established password , and dump all the information from keykatcher into any text editing software .
then , every character the person you spied on typed into their computer is revealed to you on screen .
the memory limits of keykatcher does mean the device can only display between four and 16 pages of text , depending on which model of the device has been purchased .
potential uses some of the obvious potential uses for keykatcher come from the pages of crime novels , such as eavesdropping on enemies and loved ones , stealing financial information , following the actions of strangers , and stalking people .
of course , none of this will happen if everyone follows the manufacturer 's legal disclaimer that " you may not use the device to violate the privacy rights of any other party " .
keykatcher 's makers suggest companies use its product to track everything their employees do with their computers , and that parents use it to monitor their children 's internet usage .
software is also commercially available that will track someone 's computer use .
does this really mean workers will think twice before sending personal e-mails at work ?
and is there any chance that kids will think of their parents when they surf the net ?
click here to return who would you try to catch out using keykatcher ?
i think this would be a very good idea , especially for the parents whose children use those chat rooms and dotcom sites they should n't be able to get access to .
paul armstrong , uk i 've not personaly seen this device but from the description it would appear not to be infallible .
if the device contains a memory and rom that contains a password challenge / response then a counter program could be easily written to detect the presence of the device and act accordingly .
radio scanners are outlawed .
i see no reason why this device should differ .
computer software that performs the same keystroke function and further relays that information ' live ' to an internet recipient have been freely available for years from the ' darker ' corners on the internet .
michael clark , uk when reading about this device i do n't really care if the person using it finds out what websites i go to be what if they found out my username and password for online banking ?
i would lose my money and the bank would not replay it as it would be a security breach at my end .
does n't want to be thought about in open computer labs .
graham robinson , england , uk i can see a use for these devices in a higher security environment , but for home use , they are just a device to be nosey with .
a quick visual security check will render any external ' bugs ' on the keyboard ineffective , so there is n't really an issue -lrb- with this device -rrb- .
there are lots of ways that devices leak information , and if someone wants to acquire information , they will .
you could live your life in a shielded cave , with no connections to the outside world .
mark kelsall , england as a computer scientist i really do n't see why this makes any difference to the way things are now .
the device requires physical access to the computer on which it will be installed , if that computer is running windows then there are known security flaws that can be exploited anyway so it just adds another way in .
it would be very easy -lrb- if you found one -rrb- to plug the thing in to a mouse port instead and fill it with nonsense as well .
john booinsed , uk and ?
this is just simply a visible bugging device .
without people taking much more care over their use of computers and in particular where the use them , there are far more subtle but just as effective ways of tracking your usage and what you did .
the large media interests are pushing very heavily in the us for mandatory ' copy protection ' devices in all computer systems - this is another excellent road in for unethical organisations to install backdoor bugging devices without you being aware or them .
peter galbavy , london , uk if i ever found one on my computer , it would be promptly removed and destroyed !
yuck !
anna langley , uk this device is almost completely useless .
there are much more effective ways of getting information from a computer without the users knowledge using software , this only stores a limited number of pages too .
richard hamme , uk i would bug a colleague from work to establish the truth behind his secret love affair .
find out if it is a male or female he is communicating with .
eve drop , uk its no big deal really .
software programs called " key loggers " have been available for virtually all operating systems for a long time , and there are even free versions .
if i were to want to monitor some-one 's computer activity i would use a software program since they are invisible to the user and no hardware is required .
nas , pakistan i work in the design of embedded devices and instruments .
it is my view that the whole industry is decades away from practical on line security .
we all know that the operating system is an unreliable toy .
if any one discovers a breach they are shut up with threats and even imprisonment .
campbell , uk is this really such a breakthrough ?
key-catching software has been available for years , and can be set up by users on any pc , and even by viruses -lrb- they are often used for copying peoples logons & passwords -rrb- .
the gadget itself is very obvious and could easily be removed - unlike a software alternative .
jason , uk i have a keykatcher - an early 8k model .
i obtained it to understand the threat and to advise users in the company to check their machines .
they are very effective and resemble a din to ps / 2 converter .
it has now become a habit to check the backs of my machines .
alex , uk i think that the keykatcher would be a good idea from a business point of view but i can not see how it could be used at home other than purely to ' spy ' on the action of user 's computers. is n't this then a breach of the manufacturers legal disclaimer ?

although attendance at christian churches of all denominations is declining , attendance is flourishing in some areas , according to the christian research -lrb- cr -rrb- charity .
it said most of the growth has been seen in london and the south east , where almost one in 10 people attend sunday services , compared to just under 6 % in the " coalfields " .
it believes the differences have arisen because people moving into richer areas see church attendance as a way to get involved in their new community .
you have richer people being invited to church , going along and liking it dr peter brierley christian research dr peter brierley , executive director of cr , which has just published the third edition of religious trends , said he believed the findings were partly motivated by class .
he said : " in some of the most prosperous areas there is a mobile population with people moving in .
" those people want to become part of the community and the church allows them to do that .
" you have richer people being invited to church , going along and liking it . "
dr brierley said church attendance had been hit in poorer areas because people had lost their faith as a result of their circumstances .
he said : " many churches have the perception of being of being middle class and many of the coalfield areas are not .
" many of the coalfields are also in depressed areas . "
' scots are more concerned ' cr 's findings , which cover the period 1989 to 1998 also reveal that 13.4 % of people in scotland attend church , almost twice the level for england and wales - 7.4 % .
" the scots are more concerned with religion , " dr brierley added .
" they take it very seriously .
the church has formed part of the national consciousness . "
although one in five churches in england saw their congregation grow over the period 65 % saw theirs decline , while 14 % remained static .
the study revealed the number of women ministers increased from 8.3 % in 1995 to 10.4 % in 2000 .
it also found that 67 % of the population believe in god and 52 % in heaven , while 49 % believe jesus was the son of god .

although attendance at christian churches of all denominations is declining , attendance is flourishing in some areas , according to the christian research -lrb- cr -rrb- charity .
it said most of the growth has been seen in london and the south east , where almost one in 10 people attend sunday services , compared to just under 6 % in the " coalfields " .
it believes the differences have arisen because people moving into richer areas see church attendance as a way to get involved in their new community .
you have richer people being invited to church , going along and liking it dr peter brierley christian research dr peter brierley , executive director of cr , which has just published the third edition of religious trends , said he believed the findings were partly motivated by class .
he said : " in some of the most prosperous areas there is a mobile population with people moving in .
" those people want to become part of the community and the church allows them to do that .
" you have richer people being invited to church , going along and liking it . "
dr brierley said church attendance had been hit in poorer areas because people had lost their faith as a result of their circumstances .
he said : " many churches have the perception of being of being middle class and many of the coalfield areas are not .
" many of the coalfields are also in depressed areas . "
' scots are more concerned ' cr 's findings , which cover the period 1989 to 1998 also reveal that 13.4 % of people in scotland attend church , almost twice the level for england and wales - 7.4 % .
" the scots are more concerned with religion , " dr brierley added .
" they take it very seriously .
the church has formed part of the national consciousness . "
although one in five churches in england saw their congregation grow over the period 65 % saw theirs decline , while 14 % remained static .
the study revealed the number of women ministers increased from 8.3 % in 1995 to 10.4 % in 2000 .
it also found that 67 % of the population believe in god and 52 % in heaven , while 49 % believe jesus was the son of god .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- cloning doctor to make uk bid high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- bbc news online : sci / tech tuesday , 6 november , 2001 , 08:23 gmt cloning doctor to make uk bid the italian doctor who wants to clone humans will not be allowed to work in the uk and could be sent to prison if he attempts to conduct his experiments in the country , officials said on monday .
if they say no i would like to know why .
i want them to try to justify why not prof severino antinori professor severino antinori , together with his american collaborator dr panos zavos , wants to help childless couples start a family using the cloning technology that gave the world dolly the sheep .
professor antinori told a sunday newspaper that his team would approach the uk 's regulator on infertility matters for permission to provide the cloning " treatment " in britain - to force the regulator into a debate .
but dr ruth deech , chair of the human fertilisation and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- , said the italian medic was wasting his time , and any application he made was highly unlikely to be successful .
she told the bbc : " the intention in the human fertilisation and embryology act of 1990 is clearly to ban human cloning .
we have said our policy is to ban it ; parliament has said that ; the public are against it .
" i do n't know why he is applying here .
perhaps it is some publicity stunt . "
since antinori and zavos announced their intentions to the world , they have been ostracised by much of the international medical community .
many fertility and cloning experts - including the team that created dolly - have warned of the dangers of applying an underdeveloped technique to humans .
nine monkey clones experience with animals has shown that most clone pregnancies fail , or result in the offspring being delivered stillborn or deformed .
but antinori and zavos believe the dangers have been overstated and claim to have the ability to screen out unsustainable pregnancies .
professor antinori told the sunday herald in glasgow that his application to the hfea would open up a debate on cloning .
" if they say no i would like to know why .
i want them to try to justify why not .
if there is a scientific reason i will understand .
if they refuse for religious reasons , i will not . "
if the uk bid was turned down , professor antinori said human cloning would be carried out elsewhere , either in asia or in a secret mediterranean country .
he claimed his team had already produced nine monkey clones but gave no details of the unpublished research .
the royal society of edinburgh barred antinori from participating in a scientific debate on cloning on monday .
professor antinori made international headlines in 1994 when he helped a woman of 62 have a baby .
he and zavos announced last month that the first human clone could be created before the end of the year .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- jordan 's hi-tech hopes categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 6 november , 2001 , 08:55 gmt jordan 's hi-tech hopes the aim is to put more jordanians on the net by saad hattar in jordan when king abdullah of jordan ascended the throne in february 1999 , he hoped to transform his cash-strapped country into a haven for hi-tech industry .
two-and-a-half years into his reign , the 39-year-old monarch appears to have made some progress .
king abdullah invested much of his own time and his country 's limited resources on importing and building an advanced information technology industry .
he has also expanded it 's role in the education system .
the dotcom shake-out could not have come at a better time for jordanian it businesses karim qawar int @ j chairman he introduced an e-government system and provided thousands of computers to schools and educational centres , including those in remote rural areas .
the king , according to a royal court source , wants all jordanians to have access to a computer .
despite his nation 's pressing financial problems , jordan 's new leader seems determined to fund his nation 's participation in the global it industry .
he plans to erect a silicon valley-like industrial zone in the hope of attracting about $ 150m in direct foreign investment over the next three years .
computer education computer sciences and english language programmes have been revamped over the last two years to serve pupils in lower grades .
king abdullah hopes the us and the eu , and especially britain , will help fund a 10-year educational reform strategy .
his $ 650m plan involves making major amendments to school curricula , upgrading teachers ' qualifications and setting up dozens of new , fully equipped schools and learning resource centres .
there are plans to establish an it faculty at al al-bayt university .
the ultimate aim is to make the it industry jordan 's vehicle for economic growth .
the king wants jordan to become a major player in the it industry but the dark clouds hanging over the it sector worldwide , regional uncertainty and the 11 september terror attacks on america have had a negative impact on those plans .
int @ j , the country 's it association representing 84 firms , has sought to lure potential investors into the fledgling and low-cost market following the mid-2000 nasdaq crash .
int @ j chairman , karim qawar , dismisses the internet market meltdown as a " minor setback " .
" the dotcom shake-out could not have come at a better time for jordanian it businesses , " he said in a recent interview .
" it has helped separate hype from substance .
it was a minor setback that prompted some companies to address other markets -lsb- than the us -rsb- . "
local it companies have raised just under $ 60m since september 1999 .
their declared goal is to attract $ 150m in direct foreign investment by 2004 .
regional hopes the concept of a regional dotcom market , to start off with a hard core of it-oriented countries and to expand later , has been the subject of several discussions between king abdullah and the like-minded leaders of bahrain and the united arab emirates .
but to create a climate conducive to the spread of it , they must first tackle the problem of software piracy .
a crackdown by the authorities has seen levels drop - from 90 % in late 1999 to nearly 50 % .
a focus on internet content is also necessary if jordan is to meet its target of raising the number of subscribers to 500,000 - or one in 10 jordanians - over the next two years .
the current number stands at 25,000 - a 20th of that target .
but as king abdullah strives to make ends meet in an unstable region , he appears determined to find the resources needed to turn his hi-tech dreams into reality .
you can join king abdullah for a special web , radio and television edition of talking point on friday 9 november .

in a breakfast speech at the confederation of british industry conference on tuesday , mr duncan smith warned working hours were being lost through poor public services .
failing public services do n't just create human tragedies - they result in business tragedies too iain duncan smith as the tories continue to call for a full public inquiry into what they call the " railtrack debacle " , he also asked whether the episode had scuppered hopes of more private sector involvement in public projects .
the tory leader said : " failing public services do n't just create human tragedies - they result in business tragedies too . "
' years lost ' coronary heart disease in men means 47,000 working years are lost overall every year , mr duncan smith argued .
transport problems cost uk businesses at least £ 5bn a year , according to one survey , while the " cramped and sweaty carriages " on the london underground means it " takes half an hour before you are in a fit state to think of work " .
turning to education , mr duncan smith highlighted how supermarket chain tesco spent £ 1m on literacy and numeracy courses for new recruits because it was so alarmed by poor standards .
mr duncan smith , who has promised to focus on public services , reminded the conference of a cbi survey which suggested that days off-sick were costing british business £ 10.7bn.
the tory leader plans to despatch his shadow cabinet to other european countries and says healthcare waiting times in france and germany were " virtually negligible " .
but , he added : " here it can take a year for a heart by-pass .
" a constituent of mine waiting for a by-pass started by working five days a week , gradually it went down until he was working a half day , one day a week .
" yet as he put it to me : ' my employers still have to bear the cost of not having me around . " '
' false choice ' mr duncan smith will argue the choice is not between short term tax cuts and increased investment , as tony blair argues .
" we can continue down the same road of taxing ever more heavily in order to plough ever more money to pay for unreformed services , " he said .
" or we can combine a low tax , wealth creating economy with genuine public service reform . "
the tory leader warned that the current government strategy might not only fail to work but may ultimately prove self-defeating .
" we will never pay for public services pursuing a policy that taxes and regulates business out of existence , " he continued .
mr duncan smith renewed the tory attack over the government 's handling of railtrack , arguing the episode had jeopardised chances of using private money for schools and hospitals .
he asked : " who is going to trust the government to keep to the deal after they have ripped off 250,000 shareholders of railtrack ? "
blair 's priority the criticism comes after tony blair told the cbi on monday the government would strive to keep taxes low - but if it came to a choice between taxes and spending , spending would come first .
despite recent adverse publicity surrounding public private partnerships , the prime minister said his government was committed to maintain and , where possible , extend them .
earlier , cbi chairman sir iain vallance said the business community needed to be " vigilant " over what " rather less reconstructed " figures in the government were doing while the " top team 's " attention was engaged elsewhere .
any extra taxation or regulation on business would be " untoward " when the uk was facing a potential recession .

transport problems cost uk businesses at least £ 5bn a year , according to one survey , while the " cramped and sweaty carriages " on the london underground means it " takes half an hour before you are in a fit state to think of work " .
turning to education , mr duncan smith highlighted how supermarket chain tesco spent £ 1m on literacy and numeracy courses for new recruits because it was so alarmed by poor standards .
blair said spending would come first mr duncan smith , who has promised to focus on public services , reminded the conference of a cbi survey which suggested that days off-sick were costing british business £ 10.7bn.
the tory leader plans to despatch his shadow cabinet to other european countries and says healthcare waiting times in france and germany were " virtually negligible " .
but , he added : " here it can take a year for a heart by-pass .
" a constituent of mine waiting for a by-pass started by working five days a week , gradually it went down until he was working a half day , one day a week .
" yet as he put it to me : ' my employers still have to bear the cost of not having me around . " '
' false choice ' mr duncan smith will argue the choice is not between short term tax cuts and increased investment , as tony blair argues .
" we can continue down the same road of taxing ever more heavily in order to plough ever more money to pay for unreformed services , " he said .
vallance : vigilance call " or we can combine a low tax , wealth creating economy with genuine public service reform . "
the tory leader warned that the current government strategy might not only fail to work but may ultimately prove self-defeating .
" we will never pay for public services pursuing a policy that taxes and regulates business out of existence , " he continued .
mr duncan smith renewed the tory attack over the government 's handling of railtrack , arguing the episode had jeopardised chances of using private money for schools and hospitals .
he asked : " who is going to trust the government to keep to the deal after they have ripped off 250,000 shareholders of railtrack ? "
blair 's priority the criticism comes after tony blair told the cbi on monday the government would strive to keep taxes low - but if it came to a choice between taxes and spending , spending would come first .
despite recent adverse publicity surrounding public private partnerships , the prime minister said his government was committed to maintain and , where possible , extend them .
earlier , cbi chairman sir iain vallance said the business community needed to be " vigilant " over what " rather less reconstructed " figures in the government were doing while the " top team 's " attention was engaged elsewhere .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- is the uk 's war strategy clear ?
categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 6 november , 2001 , 09:23 gmt is the uk 's war strategy clear ?
downing street has criticised the news media 's coverage of the war on terrorism .
foreign secretary , jack straw , says that by concentrating on mistakes made during the bombing raids on afghanistan , the media could erode public support for military action .
since vietnam , authorities have been acutely aware of the impact that the media can have on public perception of military campaigns , and often restrict access to information and pictures from the front line .
but conservative leader iain duncan smith says the government is guilty of issuing " confusing messages " about the objectives of the military offensive in afghanistan and is " losing the battle for hearts and minds " in the war on terrorism .
journalists argue their role is to inform the public so they can make up their own minds .
do you think the government is sending out the right message on the war on terrorism ?
should the media be more supportive of the military campaign ?
or would you prefer to make up your own mind ?
we 'll be discussing war strategy and the media on sunday at 1400 gmt in talking point on air , the phone-in programme of the bbc world service and bbc news online .

your reaction : the us has scored a couple key victories in the media war henry , usa despite the media coverage of air strike blunders , the us has scored a couple key victories in the media war : 1 .
the northern alliance is being hailed as the " good guys " in the conflict , without many of their past atrocities mentioned .
2 .
the media is not pressing for the united states to utilize negotiations as a means of bringing bin laden to justice and ending the armed conflict .
it is also not criticizing the us for making unconditional ultimatums , thus both forcing war and securing bin laden 's freedom .
henry , usa i am absolutely disgusted by the level and duration and type of weaponry used in this campaign .
it is not acceptable to me and i wonder how these leaders of the people expect us to get behind them when they are carrying out atrocities no different to those carried out on september 11th .
i was horrified and saddened then , and i am even more so now .
every day since the bombs started falling i have been unable to think about anything else except those poor destitute people now being blown to pieces .
this coalition is headed for disaster if it keeps this aerial bombardment up .
it is cold-blooded murder and must stop .
farook , spain only a simpleton would think that civilians would not be injured during a war .
so far , the allies have done well to not just carpet bomb every square meter of that god-forsaken place .
it is during these times that we need to have an idea of what is actually happening .
god forbid that we have vietnam era body counts that indicate nothing .
we need somebody to give us good and bad news .
the media neither win nor lose wars : misinformation is what loses wars .
dean , us the media believes that dirty laundry sells best , and that is why they focus on military blunders and civilian deaths travis , usa the media is not concerned about their effect on the american or british people .
they view their mission as one of selling newspapers and advertising spots instead of informing the public .
the media believes that dirty laundry sells best , and that is why they focus on military blunders and civilian deaths .
we have been attacked in the same ruthless way that the germans attacked britain during wwii .
i bet the media was n't so worried about germany 's civilian deaths during that conflict .
travis , usa as usual the media is jeopardising the lives of , not only our forces , but also citizens like myself who live and work in muslim countries .
these people believe every adverse piece of news that is reported and they are becoming more and more emotionally aroused .
even muslims that are living in the uk believe all the propaganda dished out by the taleban government and the prejudiced media organisations .
i ca n't remember any media organisation emphasising the deaths of the women in the wtc and i ca n't remember reading anything about children dying there .
were there any child victims at the wtc or were they all adults ?
the longer the media continues to report the way that they do now the more likely other muslim nationals are going to become involved in the problem .
there is already a large contingent of ' foreign ' muslims fighting in afghanistan .
the media should report confirmable facts only and they should not publish rumours or political propaganda .
phil t , oman in vietnam , the media were allowed access to the front line .
in this war thanks to the taleban most of the media are sat at home with us .
as tv crews are unable to show the true effect of the bombing in afghanistan , then perhaps they should concentrate on the bits of bodies still being pulled out from the wreckage of the trade center .
people might then be reminded that this is not a war against the people of afghanistan but a bloody war against an evil bunch of terrorists .
malcolm parker , england i find it incredible that political correctness can influence how we fight a war john , uk i find it incredible that political correctness can influence how we fight a war .
there has been too much media emphasis on the few civilian casualties .
only 50 years ago -lrb- and more recently -rrb- , blanket bombing was a normal part of war .
we should be grateful that this is no longer the case .
people do get hurt in wars -lrb- civilians included -rrb- and this is a war .
as for those ' british ' who take arms on the side of terrorists against our soldiers , i ca n't believe there is any consideration as to whether or not this constitutes treason .
william joyce -lrb- lord haw haw -rrb- was hanged for less - and he was never a british subject .
it 's a shame that treason ceased to be a capital offence 3 years ago -lrb- i say this as an opponent of capital punishment for all other crimes -rrb- .
those who speak out in support of terrorists should be interred in times of war .
they are the enemy to the common values we hold dear in our democracies .
we can not reason with those who do not even value their own life , let alone that of the innocent men , women and children who died on 11th september .
war is unfortunately our only recourse and it must be executed with grim determination .
the appeasers should read up on their history , and think about what is at stake .
john , uk once again , most of those who have posted have either not answered the question or gone beyond the actual question itself .
the series of questions that the bbc has posted here is a perfect example of the modern media .
one of the biggest problems with today 's society and media is that information is too quickly available , yes , i said too quickly available .
the media today tries to report what will give them the best ratings , period .
sometimes that means that they are reporting things before they are confirmed or are asking questions that do n't have concrete answers yet and are cause for speculation .
people and the media need to be patient and wait for things to happen before they go off and make assumptions about what has or has not happened .
as to who has one the media war - the taleban and bin laden have because we the people have let the press hand them the victory by being too impatient in waiting for results .
ww ii took 5 years + and that was when the enemy was out in the open .
today 's society wants things to happen too quickly .
mike a. , usa i believe that common people are getting frustrated because of the uncertainties posed by the current situation .
we are angry about wtc and the 6000 dead caused by an invisible enemy .
i doubt the us led alliance has a fair idea about the real culprits .
but i do support their action to go after the known terrorist groups that happen to be concentrated in afghanistan .
i think western media itself is quite frustrated because of lack of " stories " due to the secret nature of us led alliance 's operations .
on the other hand the enemy offers plenty of information for our media .
therefore , it seems as if taleban is winning the media war .
in reality , i do not believe that is the case .
irrespective of what media does , i do not believe that us led alliance will lose public support for its " war on terrorism " .
i believe us will gain overwhelming public support to deploy ground troops in afghanistan soon !
vijay , usa it 's a boring war from a media perspective pete , uk i 'm with blair on this one .
it 's a boring war from a media perspective .
our reporters have had their fun creeping in trenches and disguising themselves as women , and now their main gambit to retain interest is to whip up controversy .
pete , uk while i support freedom of the press , i am disconcerted by the irresponsible behaviour of several american media outlets .
its sensationalism over anthrax in this country is at a ridiculous level .
the members of the media here have shown themselves to be the impatient ones concerning the war 's progress .
the president of abc news in new york said on monday that he did n't feel like he should have an opinion about the validity of the pentagon as a terrorist target .
members of the media have taken relativism , renamed it objectivity , and turned it into a religion .
patrick , usa the media should support military action .
no other nation tries so hard to avoid civilian casualties as the us .
let 's not forget our objective - to rid the world of terrorism .
some casualties , both civilian and military are unavoidable .
pam martin , usa this could be asking for the impossible , but i would appreciate the media reporting unbiased facts in order to enable me to draw my own conclusions .
give the people the facts - yes , that means the good , bad , and ugly , and let the people make their own analysis of the information .
vriana , usa the incessant analysis , discussion and speculation on the news does no good for anyone linda , uk how can the government be supposed to run an effective military campaign when they have to condense every one of their decisions and actions into an easily palatable soundbite to appease the masses ?
we should be told the truth but the incessant analysis , discussion and speculation on the news does no good for anyone .
all it serves to do is spread panic and falsehood .
tell us what we need to know and then leave the people who -lrb- we hope -rrb- know what they are doing to get on with things .
after all , as the media were keen to tell us after the election , this government had a huge majority of popular support .
now it 's time for all those who voted for them to stand by their decisions .
linda , uk why does the media only show the results of supposed targeting errors on the part of the us and its allies ?
no one can or does verify the claims of the taliban .
so the media is guilty of spreading taliban propaganda .
edward zembrzuski , usa the behaviour of the us media as an instrument of war is so transparent rose raimondo , us the media has an obligation to report the facts .
the us media , in particular the ny times , has betrayed its readership horribly .
an anti-war rally held in ny city on 10/27 focused on the media repression .
some referred to it as " diabolical " .
the behaviour of the us media as an instrument of war is so transparent .
i wo n't buy a us newspaper for that reason .
they wo n't get my money to deliver non-information and propaganda .
it 's especially frightening in america where to not be flag-waving war supporter is to be accused of being a hater of america .
this is an outrage !
rose raimondo , us i 've lived in a country under an authoritarian government style where media could n't inform the truth .
so we only knew what our government wanted us to know .
but , thank god , now it 's better .
i just do n't want the world leaders to act the same as my ex-government .
just let people know where the world they live is going to and let them make up their own mind .
it 's not only the life of the people out there , but it 's about our life too .
desi ardz , indonesia war is n't attractive and should never be presented as such .
chris , uk we must support a free press / media and the ideas this represents sanj , uk we must support a free press / media and the ideas this represents .
i am a supporter of the war , but do find myself questioning the tone of some of the reporting .
we are only getting one side of this story .
western governments can say what they like , but western press is free to question this .
we can not say the same for the arab satellite channel that regularly reports from afghanistan .
it is censored and is only taken to where the taliban wants it to report from .
why then do we not discount its reports , instead of flashing them around the free world as fact ?
our free media needs to question the motives behind these reports and continue to show what the taliban are really like - vicious killers with scant regard for their own people .
sanj , uk it 's not about forgetting september 11th , but the fact that we assume that civilian casualties are part and parcel of this " war on terrorism " -lrb- in reality it is n't , just look at who 's been affected , the afghans and not terrorists -rrb- is sickening in itself .
the media should play an important role in condemning this pointless war and focusing on the fact that what the afghan people are experiencing is blood revenge acted out by americans and sadly us british , too .
i am ashamed to be part of this country .
james , chester , uk any sensible person must have condemned the september 11th terrorist acts , and must condemn the terrorist act of killing innocent afghans .
but remember you can only do that after having received unbiased reports from the media .
please let the media do their noble job with no interference .
mbondela , a. , tanzania dealing with the influence of the media is a good example of the difficulties a democracy faces when it wages war .
if the us is so bent on defending its core values like democracy , it should recognise the fact that it is democracy itself that gives the media their role .
instead of blaming the media , they should just accept that complexity .
bart van der griendt , the netherlands news reports are soaked with anti-islamic ideas junaid alam , uk thanks to electronic and print media to bolster support for anti-west opinion .
this is made possible through their vividly biased , anti-islamic reporting .
their news reports , let alone their editorial , are soaked with their anti-islamic ideas .
this makes readers and audience , especially muslims , more and more against these so-called free , just and democratic nations .
when they report taliban atrocities , they have all sources to confirm those reports .
but when they publish western atrocities and massacre , they do n't have any independent source to confirm .
junaid alam , uk i agree with terry .
the media are forgetting the 11th september and forgetting that the taliban wo n't even let them in to report on what is actually happening .
they are being used !
of course the media was always used in war - look at the d-day deception in ww2 - but for the first time it appears that our own media is succumbing to the taliban manipulation .
i do n't support the actions of the us and uk to date but regardless of that our media has privileges beyond most , but with them comes responsibilities .
even today on the tv i see them reporting on a confirmed us special forces base camp in northern afghanistan !
if i was a us general i would be furious , one media group just put his men in more danger just so they could get higher ratings .
absolutely disgusting .
the british media have been a disgrace this last few weeks .
if any allied soldier dies as a result of irresponsible reporting i would lock up the editor and close the organisation employing him forever .
even the bbc are not without some blame on this although they are not as bad as most .
gareth , uk if any journalist risks the life of any of our troops they should be imprisoned for treason terry amis , uk we are at war .
careless talk costs lives .
if any journalist risks the life of any of our troops they should be imprisoned for treason and the paper they work for shut down .
get it straight .
on september 11th , 6000 innocent people were massacred intentionally by al queda and the taleban monsters that support it .
over the past few weeks there have been unintentional civilian casualties of war , they are regrettable but they are a fact of life .
if we do nothing , next time it may be 60000 .
hard but true terry amis , uk glancing through some of the comments posted below criticising the media coverage of civilian suffering in afghanistan ... it begs the question , ' are you afraid to consider the consequences of war but just blindly follow your politicians ? '
this is a war against a figurehead enemy , carried out to satisfy popular opinion as the real perpetrators of the terrorist actions can not be targeted by our armed forces .
the civilian casualties can not be ignored ... how many are acceptable , 1 , 10 , 100 or 5000 ?
rob , uk the media is key , but the uk popular press is not the main issue .
the reason that the very phrase ' war on terrorism ' is so clearly idiotic and oxymoronic is that an act of domineering aggression is the best possible way to provoke further terrorist attacks .
if the perception in the islamic world is that the campaign in afghanistan is just one more arrogant , insensitive act of colonialism then i 'd guess this campaign is more likely to encourage future atrocities - like the massacre in pakistan - than prevent them .
the popular press , public opinion and elite opinion in the islamic world are what the government needs to be scrutinising , more urgently so than the views in our liberal press .
darien pugh , england with mr bush telling the world : " there is no evidence suggesting a connection between the anthrax cases and the terrorist attacks .
but bin laden is an evil man .
he is capable of anything .
he is behind the anthrax attacks " and the chief of british defence staff claiming that the war could go on for fifty years , the taleban do not need any sophisticated western spin doctors to run their media war !
mohansingh , india the media have exploited all angles on the war to the brink of tedium , and now all that there is left to pursue is the " you 're not winning fast enough " slant .
there is clearly a long-term plan behind the whole operation , and any media hacks who expected a quick fix are quite frankly stupid .
let the government play out the war in the way that it sees fit - and then be judged at the end .
rodger edwards , uk in a war , the role of an objective media is even more crucial yusuf nabee , south africa i completely agree that the media 's role is merely to inform the public so that they can form their own opinions .
coming from a country where the media was traditionally used to enforce government opinion on the public for many years , i must stress how important it is for the media to remain objective and credible .
if not , then the media is nothing more than a voice of government and merely serves to distribute propaganda .
in a war , the role of an objective media is even more crucial and the question that should be asked of government is : " how can the government guarantee the objectivity of the media ? " , rather than " how can the government use the media to promote their cause ? "
yusuf nabee , south africa in many ways this conflict is exposing the limitations of the 24/7 news model .
in the absence of facts -lrb- apart from claim and counter claim -rrb- , we instead get speculation , recycled conspiracy theories -lrb- last week it was a war against islam , now its apparently about an oil pipeline -rrb- , dubious experts and an expectation of immediate results .
the fact that some media outlets are now talking of a " quagmire " after only 3 weeks of military action is perhaps an inevitable result of replaying the same stories over and over again , giving rise to a yearning for something new and exciting to happen .
kw , uk i 'm sure the taliban are winning the popularity battle that 's the only reason our government is complaining about the media .
i think they should address the public concern rather than quashing it , is n't that what makes us different from those we are fighting ?
as a tax paying british citizen i would like to make my own mind about this war .
governments often claim successes that later turn out to be incorrect .
the government claims that their targeting is very precise , but we know this is not true .
terrorism must be eradicated , but the tactics deployed must be correct as well .
we must never give blank cheques to governments especially when it involves the killing of innocent people .
every war is different and must be given due consideration .
there is growing scepticism that recent wars have been waged purely for oil and this is no exception .
we could have overthrown saddam hussein 11 years ago , but we did n't , instead we have killed 200,000 iraqi soldiers and 1.5m iraqis through sanctions .
is this moral ?
no .
we do it in order to control the oil supplies of the middle east .
stuart , uk sometimes people knowing the truth hurts the government .
it 's about time this government learned that we voted for them to represent us and not to shield us from the facts of a fast becoming military debacle .
paul atkins , uk i think there is too much media emphasis on showing civilian casualties in afghanistan .
night after night we see long tv news articles about the bombing of civilians but no mention of whether they were near the target .
will the media show night after night the effects of september 11th and other terrorist atrocities on those who are maimed or whose families have lost loved ones ?
i think not .
any casualties are regrettable but let 's remember , they could have been avoided if bin-laden had been handed over , but they were never going to .
lets see more balanced journalism please .
m.lunnon , england since we -lrb- the public -rrb- are not at the war front therefore our sole representatives are the media and not the usa president , uk prime minister and not their ministers .
i would prefer to make up my own mind through reading the news and seeing the television news from various countries dealing with reports about the war .
after three weeks of bombing they have only killed innocent people of afghanistan and they want to continue bombing during ramadan and kill more afghan people who follow islam .
it seems that usa and uk are losing both the battle and the war .
they can not find bin laden and they have to stop killing innocent people .
dr.khamis , sweden the media is winning the war almost single-handedly for the terrorists .
disturbing images of human suffering and pain portrayed by the media is causing a general lack of support for military action against the taleban .
if the media keeps showing these images then no doubt the bombing will cease and the taleban and other terrorist organisations throughout the world will be free to commit more disgusting attacks against innocent civilians like those of september 11th .
s thomas , uk / aus the western media is unwittingly serving the interests of the taleban eric , dominica if we consider the media war to be between the taleban and the usa and its allies , then i 'd say that the latter are losing .
not necessarily because of the propaganda skills of the taleban , but more due to the fact that the massive 24-hour western media coverage allows the allied politicians and experts adequate rope with which to hang themselves .
anytime you talk so much , you invariably express some untruths which decreases your credibility .
also , the tv ratings would drop if the media did not include real news of afghan suffering and instead focused on suspect black and white footage of american smart bombs hitting some dots .
the western media therefore is unwittingly serving the interests of the taleban .
eric , dominica i can not believe the hypocrisy of the so-called leaders of the democratic nations .
freedom is what they say they are defending with the war against terrorism .
but where is our freedom of speech now ?
what they are guilty of is suppression of free speech and censorship of the media .
i believe this is against the constitution of the united states and this very act is what middle eastern countries are denounced for in the west .
i want to know now why the killing of innocent afghans should be hidden from us .
laila , uk the media in the us is independent as long as it is a matter of internal affairs .
for example , pundits were allowed to give any point of view they wanted when it came to clinton 's sex scandal .
but when it comes to foreign policies , american media is fully controlled by the government .
otherwise they would tell the people about how sanctions killed a huge number of people in iraq , and about 10 percent of the north korean population .
i have never heard the expression economic terrorism on tv , but i hear this used by an independent american radio network .
in my opinion , the us media is serving the government while trying to calm the people of america , but on the other side it betrays americans by not telling them the truth .
for this reason , unfortunately , many uninformed muslims think that all americans are bad .
i live in the us and i know american people are innocent but this may not be true for the government and unfortunately americans do not know everything their government does outside of its borders .
iqbal , usa the politicians in the us side seem to be losing the media war by making ambiguous statements .
donald rumsfeld , for example , alleges that the taleban are hiding among the civilians .
he further adds : " brave people give their lives for their cause " , thereby admitting that the taleban do have a cause .
what about american pilots ?
would they dare to come down a little bit and hit their targets accurately ?
irfan haqqee , toronto , canada as far as i can see , the media is only expressing widespread ambivalence about this war .
the uk government embarked upon it without any mandate from the public whose collective views it is theoretically supposed to represent .
ray , uk if it were not for the media , all we would hear is unabashed one-sided propaganda mike walsh , canada i believe that the media is doing what it is supposed to be doing and that is to report the facts .
if the facts are innocent civilians being killed then it is the media 's job to report that .
we live in a democracy and are therefore entitled to voice our concerns .
i am a british ex-pat and i am ashamed of the way tony blair and his government sucks up to everything that bush does .
if it were not for the media , all we would hear is unabashed one-sided propaganda .
mike walsh , canada i think the media in the united states is creating a vietnam situation .
members of the media should leave the war to the military .
they repeatedly take the fifth amendment way too far .
i do n't think the american people are buying their criticism .
what do they really know .
they are not on the front lines but a mountaintop , they get their news from arabs who are not friendly to the usa .
they should support our boys and girls who are risking their lives to stop terrorism and stop their liberal 60s and 70s thinking .
joanne desanda , usa the military should not have to clear its plans with editors before going on a mission juan , brussels , belgium you are joking right ?
this is going to last a long time and i am sure that nobody in the media are experts on waging war , even the so-called experts that are constantly paraded in front of the cameras .
most of them i am sure have never been close to a gun in their lives .
wars are won by killing people and taking territory .
first you soften them up and then you go in .
be patient .
most of the war is being waged beyond what you can see and hear and thus it is driving the media crazy .
i 'm sorry to break the news to you but the military should not have to clear its plans with editors before going on a mission .
juan , brussels , belgium most of the messages posted here from the us and uk are criticising the media for bombing the taleban and afghanistan .
to them it would be correct if the media hid the killing of afghan children , women and innocent people who never left their villages and have nothing to do with the terrorist activities in the us .
please never forget that the media these days projects the events on a global level .
the media has to remain impartial and truthful to secure the confidence of listeners and viewers in all parts of the world .
we the people listen to bbc , cnn and others only because of the confidence we have in the validity and truth of their news and views .
but the media war has already been won by the taleban .
the us and its allies so far have not been able to show evidence of achieving the objectives of their war against the poorest nation in the world .
has bin laden been arrested , killed or even traced ?
have the taleban been toppled ?
has al-qaeda been destroyed ?
the us has no answer to these questions .
the statement by the us defence secretary saying that they might never catch bin laden is a clear indication of their failure in achieving the objective of the present bombing campaign .
zargham , pakistan anything spoken by a uk politician is an obvious attempt to defraud the public into believing that every action the west takes is justified peter , uk i think the west 's media coverage would be much better served if politicians in this country kept their mouths shut .
every time tony blair , jack straw or anyone else from the government talks to the media they erode what little credibility they have with their lies , scare mongering and inability to provide constructive arguments to back up their causes .
the west will never win the media war when almost anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that anything spoken by a uk politician with regards to this so-called war should not be taken seriously , and is an obvious attempt to defraud the public into believing that every action the west takes is justified .
peter , uk today 's media is quite biased in favour of the weaker side regardless of how wrong or atrocious that group can be .
this prevents democracies from fighting effectively against all forms of terrorism around the world .
the meek reporters are afraid to report on pro-violence , pro-bin-laden events within palestinian authority .
political correctness stops them from reporting true insights of the origins of islamic fundamentalist violence .
the media confuses the minds of people in the free world and thus plays into the hands of the destructive forces .
robert , canada i agree 100 percent with robert from canada .
the western media has proven itself to be far more interested in political correctness than in doing its job , namely reporting facts and conducting a thought-out analysis of a situation .
honestly , why should we in the west care who is winning this " media war " ?
does anyone really think that the media 's kid gloves treatment of radical islam is going to make them hate us less ?
can a more balanced approach bring back the 6,000 dead or even stave off future terrorism on the part of islamic fundamentalists ?
not a chance .
we should have the unity of purpose and trust in our freely elected governments to be secure in what our nations are doing .
just remember this , flawed though our media may be , at least it is free to express itself .
that 's a lot more than can be said for the media for many middle eastern countries .
nathan , usa a " media war " would only be applicable if you wanted one side to win .
speaking for myself , i hate politicians and the taleban equally .
martin , england does anybody really know why the uk and us are bombing afghanistan and now sending in ground troops ?
why are we killing and terrorising all these innocent people ?
it 's not to get bin laden .
even rumsfeld knows we ca n't do that .
it 's not to put an end to terrorism , everybody knows that will never happen .
perhaps the media could find out for us instead of grinding out bombing statistics or displaying what the bombers look like from beyond the target zones .
that is what the media is there for .
the problem is that most of the media reporters are poodles when faced with government spokesmen .
the media is supposed to be there to keep us fully informed .
we ca n't rely on the government for that .
more incisive questioning is needed here .
after all this government is spending our money to kill innocent people .
there are simply not enough paxmans around to pin the government down on state terrorism .
alex brown , uk we 're losing the media war because the taleban wo n't let us forget about their dead and we 've already forgotten about our own shane watts , usa in the hours following the september 11 terrorist attacks , a large banner was hung from a building overlooking ground zero .
it 's touching message " we will never forget " has now been made redundant , as seven weeks later we 've already forgotten .
this is due in large part to the media losing its focus .
when did this stop being about 6,000 victims of terrorism and start being about international politics ?
we 're losing the media war because the taleban wo n't let us forget about their dead and we 've already forgotten about our own .
shane watts , usa i think the media is being fair .
after all we practically expect the usa to bomb civilians - it is renowned for it .
it was only a matter of time then before bombs started going astray and it is good that it gets reported .
personally i think the us is making a pig 's ear of the whole thing , and i wish blair would stop sucking up and tell the us straight .
someone has to .
chris , uk i do n't believe the media has a choice in this .
it must support the us and the british military if it believes in freedom .
however , the senseless killing of wretchedly poor afghan civilians is heartbreaking .
are we fighting a war against bin laden or the taleban ?
tell us the truth if you can .
george wood , usa since the government is waging a war against afghanistan supposedly on behalf of us voters , we have a right to know the truth of what is being done " on our behalf " .
but to bomb afghan civilians in retaliation for what some misguided terrorists did makes the uk and the usa terrorists themselves .
what is interesting is to find out the real agenda behind this bombing and the trails all seem to lead to the oil refineries .
jane , uk if the us wanted to target civilians in afghanistan the civilian casualties would be in the hundreds of thousands by now .
look at how effectively the us and its allies targeted civilians during wwii in tokyo , dresden , hamburg and other axis cities .
i think some sections of the media are looking to further their careers by accentuating the so-called brutality of the us response .
roger , miami , florida , usa we should be allowed to make up our own minds about the conflict martin , uk i think that both sides of the story should be reported in a fair way .
we did not ask our pm to " stand shoulder to shoulder " with the us .
for this reason we should be allowed to make up our own minds about the conflict .
the problem with propaganda is that you always find out the truth after the conflict and then it is too late .
martin , uk the media should be providing some context for the civilian casualties rather than implying that every bomb that goes astray calls into question the basis for the action .
there has never been a war that did not involve " collateral damage " , and this is no exception .
it should also be noted that the taleban forces continue to attempt to shoot down cruise missiles and fire surface-to-air missiles of their own .
both actions also risk causing civilian casualties .
i would say to the media : stop behaving as if you have only had 30 seconds to prepare for every story , and give us some real journalism .
martin barrett , uk the media has already surrendered itself to the taleban 's agenda steve , birmingham , uk the media is , once again , a willing puppet of the enemies of the very democracy that enables it to exist in the first place .
to listen to the broadcasts and read the headlines in the usa , a general concern about anthrax has been whipped up into a panic that has left the whole nation gripped with fear .
life goes on , bio-threat or not .
as for the uk media frenzy that accompanies each bomb that goes astray - does it really believe that we are unaware that such things happen in war ?
do the reporters who dwell on the misery of these innocents really think that they are reporting anything that we did not already know ?
the anti-terror coalition with the us-uk alliance at its heart will never win the media war .
the media has already surrendered itself to the taleban 's agenda .
the public , thankfully , have more sense and know instinctively that in a fight against enemies who would not think twice about causing " collateral " or any other form of mortal damage - the fight must continue to the last .
when we win , of course , the media will be on hand to tell us all how uselessly we performed and how we could have shortened the war by years if only we 'd listened to them .
steve , birmingham , uk was n't it the media that kept everybody 's spirits up during ww2 .
maybe our war reporters should stop criticising for once and show a bit of solidarity .
sandra , uk so what is right , here ?
to inform us that mistakes have been made or mislead us with misinformation so as not to lose any support for the bombing campaign .
there is enough propaganda already and information is concealed from us so as to encourage support for the us and uk military campaign .
let us at least have a little bit of balance in this terrible situation .
after all , is this not a basic human right ?
alice , uk i personally think that downing street started losing the war the minute tony blair started acting like bush 's lap dog and entered the country into a war without asking the public their opinion as to whether we wanted to enter this war .
the government also started losing it the minute it began to act on this particular case of terrorism when it has done so little with regards to the terrorism we have suffered at the hands of the ira .
i do n't agree with the bombing .
i never agreed with going into afghanistan , but now the situation has escalated out of control .
i think the media has been scare mongering people with fears of bio-terrorism and so on , but i would rather be informed and read different opinions than suffer at the hands of labour spin doctors who have no public empathy or understanding of the people whose taxes pay their wages .
there is no winner in this situation .
real people are dying in afghanistan as we speak .
it 's simply a no win situation .
blair and bush should have accepted the taleban 's offer to hand over bin laden to a neutral country to be put on trial .
the fact that they never even considered that offer was a disgrace and nothing they do can make up for that serious lack of diplomatic judgement .
sharon b , uk in this age of information and technology we have every right to know the unprejudiced and unbiased truth .
propaganda machinery plays an active role during war times but it 's the responsibility of reporters and journalists to dig deep for the truth .
therefore , the media should only be supportive of the truth and remain unbiased and unprejudiced .
manzoor ahmed , karachi , pakistan impartial reporting should not be restricted by the government leena , uk freedom of speech and impartial reporting regardless of the type of news should not be restricted by the government .
we the public have a right of hear all the news .
after all , public money is also involved here .
so far i have not seen news channels , at least the ones i watch , like bbc , sky , itn concentrate on the inherent mistakes in this war .
news should be reported as and when it happens and not edited to suit worried governments .
leena , uk though i support the war against terrorism , i totally disagree with the idea of only reporting what the government wants us to know .
this is at the very root of what separates us from the taleban .
hh , uk if the government would actually state once and for all what the goal of this war is , and the conditions that will result in victory , there would be no need for media speculation .
first of all it was to capture osama bin laden .
now it is to replace the taleban .
what 's next ?
guy hammond , england the media is not objective .
it never has been .
therefore it should be clear in reporting successes as well as mistakes .
where is the good news in media coverage these days ?
everyone always focuses on the bad news - disasters , tragedies , casualties , and so forth .
who says people do not want to hear good news ?
it 's really not surprising that the world is in such a mess these days when all you see and hear is how bad things are and never get to hear how good things are or how situations have been resolved .
anything else automatically gets relegated to documentary programs , as if it is for special interest or fringe groups and not suitable for mainstream audiences .
as far as the current crisis is concerned , the media is taking its hobby of policy criticism too far .
we have an enemy and if they have no qualms in manipulating the media to their end we have to counteract this and use the media for more positive reporting .
victor d , amsterdam , netherlands it seems the media has quickly forgotten september 11 james bird , uk pictures of innocent afghan children covered in blood from injuries caused by us bombs will obviously begin to erode public support for the bombing .
however whenever i see these reports from afghanistan i find myself shouting " where 's the balance " at the tv .
what about the reports on the 6,000 victims and their families devastated by the september 11 atrocity ?
it seems the media has quickly forgotten september 11 and is now obsessed with getting the most heart-rending shot of innocent afghan civilians to lead into the ever increasing features on " should we stop the bombing ? "
it is typical of the liberal bleeding hearts that run our television media to miss the point of all this .
we are fighting a war to prevent another september 11 , or worse , from occurring .
this is all that matters .
in my opinion the articles and features in the media should begin to question whether we are doing enough to achieve our objectives .
war is war , and the most important thing is to win , and win quickly , within international rules .
at the moment i feel another vietnam coming on as our leaders are becoming more concerned about what is written in the guardian or debated on newsnight than getting quick , decisive results on the ground .
my appeal to the media is to please ensure that reporting is balanced .
we must not forget why we are at war .
james bird , uk i assume the term " media war " has the same meaning as propaganda .
does anybody really need help from the media in understanding the difference between a bomb directed at terrorists missing its target or the terrorists breaking into a church , looking a child in the eyes and then murdering the same child with a hail of bullets .
the popularity battle will certainly not change my opinion .
phillip , uk i think that the media 's reporting of the war in afghanistan is not much different from their reporting on anything - sensationalist , emotive , and subjective .
we have recently seen reporters criticising the us and uk tactics from positions of complete ignorance - those on the so called frontline even admit that they really do n't know what is going on in the wider theatre of operations , but they still seem to comment on it .
the military have a plan and huge intelligence assets to support them - so i think they know why they are only dropping one or two bombs here or there , and not sending in waves of troops .
unfortunately members of the media do n't know the plan , so they try to speculate - but in their usual style they only focus on the negative side .
dick sparshatt , uk / us is journalism not meant to be a pillar of democracy ?
shahid h mian , australia we are already getting only about 10 percent of the truth and in my opinion the taleban are winning the media war despite all the propaganda of western media and censorship .
but the truth can not be hidden .
mr rumsfeld has to eat his words every second day .
he denies some media reports one day and the next day he admits them .
the world has changed a lot .
this is not the stone age when people did not know what was happening in another part of the world .
we news freaks do not just rely on one form of media or the other .
we like to know and analyse the reports from all different sources in order to believe them .
and people have every right to know the truth .
is journalism not meant to be a pillar of democracy ?
shahid h mian , australia it would be lovely if the media stuck to actually reporting the news .
a lot of what we get amounts to sensationalism and scare mongering just to sell a few more copies .
certain outlets of the media , such as some of the tabloid papers , are often more of a hindrance than a help , and should take their responsibilities of reporting news more seriously .
yvonne , uk i am disgusted with the media in this country .
i am fiercely patriotic , but i am slowly being brainwashed by the media into being embarrassed about my nationality and the believing that freedom should be upheld at all costs .
when is the british media going to stand behind the british people and their beliefs instead of scare mongering the public and reporting liberal do-gooder nonsense .
jon doody , reading , uk jack straw is n't exactly hiding his desire to censor the media 's attempts to tell us the truth about afghanistan , is he ?
the propaganda war looks to be going in the west 's favour , even as the real war is doomed to failure from the start .
never mind , once the taleban are replaced with a regime open to the building of oil pipelines , the war on terrorism and the countless innocent lives lost will be quietly forgotten in the time it takes to fill your suv with cheap fuel and drive to the supermarket for even cheaper food .

downing street has criticised the news media 's coverage of the war on terrorism .
foreign secretary , jack straw , says that by concentrating on mistakes made during the bombing raids on afghanistan , the media could erode public support for military action .
since vietnam , authorities have been acutely aware of the impact that the media can have on public perception of military campaigns , and often restrict access to information and pictures from the front line .
but conservative leader iain duncan smith says the government is guilty of issuing " confusing messages " about the objectives of the military offensive in afghanistan and is " losing the battle for hearts and minds " in the war on terrorism .
journalists argue their role is to inform the public so they can make up their own minds .
do you think the government is sending out the right message on the war on terrorism ?
should the media be more supportive of the military campaign ?
or would you prefer to make up your own mind ?

your reaction : the us has scored a couple key victories in the media war henry , usa despite the media coverage of air strike blunders , the us has scored a couple key victories in the media war : 1 .
the northern alliance is being hailed as the " good guys " in the conflict , without many of their past atrocities mentioned .
2 .
the media is not pressing for the united states to utilize negotiations as a means of bringing bin laden to justice and ending the armed conflict .
it is also not criticizing the us for making unconditional ultimatums , thus both forcing war and securing bin laden 's freedom .
henry , usa i am absolutely disgusted by the level and duration and type of weaponry used in this campaign .
it is not acceptable to me and i wonder how these leaders of the people expect us to get behind them when they are carrying out atrocities no different to those carried out on september 11th .
i was horrified and saddened then , and i am even more so now .
every day since the bombs started falling i have been unable to think about anything else except those poor destitute people now being blown to pieces .
this coalition is headed for disaster if it keeps this aerial bombardment up .
it is cold-blooded murder and must stop .
farook , spain only a simpleton would think that civilians would not be injured during a war .
so far , the allies have done well to not just carpet bomb every square meter of that god-forsaken place .
it is during these times that we need to have an idea of what is actually happening .
god forbid that we have vietnam era body counts that indicate nothing .
we need somebody to give us good and bad news .
the media neither win nor lose wars : misinformation is what loses wars .
dean , us the media believes that dirty laundry sells best , and that is why they focus on military blunders and civilian deaths travis , usa the media is not concerned about their effect on the american or british people .
they view their mission as one of selling newspapers and advertising spots instead of informing the public .
the media believes that dirty laundry sells best , and that is why they focus on military blunders and civilian deaths .
we have been attacked in the same ruthless way that the germans attacked britain during wwii .
i bet the media was n't so worried about germany 's civilian deaths during that conflict .
travis , usa as usual the media is jeopardising the lives of , not only our forces , but also citizens like myself who live and work in muslim countries .
these people believe every adverse piece of news that is reported and they are becoming more and more emotionally aroused .
even muslims that are living in the uk believe all the propaganda dished out by the taleban government and the prejudiced media organisations .
i ca n't remember any media organisation emphasising the deaths of the women in the wtc and i ca n't remember reading anything about children dying there .
were there any child victims at the wtc or were they all adults ?
the longer the media continues to report the way that they do now the more likely other muslim nationals are going to become involved in the problem .
there is already a large contingent of ' foreign ' muslims fighting in afghanistan .
the media should report confirmable facts only and they should not publish rumours or political propaganda .
phil t , oman in vietnam , the media were allowed access to the front line .
in this war thanks to the taleban most of the media are sat at home with us .
as tv crews are unable to show the true effect of the bombing in afghanistan , then perhaps they should concentrate on the bits of bodies still being pulled out from the wreckage of the trade center .
people might then be reminded that this is not a war against the people of afghanistan but a bloody war against an evil bunch of terrorists .
malcolm parker , england i find it incredible that political correctness can influence how we fight a war john , uk i find it incredible that political correctness can influence how we fight a war .
there has been too much media emphasis on the few civilian casualties .
only 50 years ago -lrb- and more recently -rrb- , blanket bombing was a normal part of war .
we should be grateful that this is no longer the case .
people do get hurt in wars -lrb- civilians included -rrb- and this is a war .
as for those ' british ' who take arms on the side of terrorists against our soldiers , i ca n't believe there is any consideration as to whether or not this constitutes treason .
william joyce -lrb- lord haw haw -rrb- was hanged for less - and he was never a british subject .
it 's a shame that treason ceased to be a capital offence 3 years ago -lrb- i say this as an opponent of capital punishment for all other crimes -rrb- .
those who speak out in support of terrorists should be interred in times of war .
they are the enemy to the common values we hold dear in our democracies .
we can not reason with those who do not even value their own life , let alone that of the innocent men , women and children who died on 11th september .
war is unfortunately our only recourse and it must be executed with grim determination .
the appeasers should read up on their history , and think about what is at stake .
john , uk once again , most of those who have posted have either not answered the question or gone beyond the actual question itself .
the series of questions that the bbc has posted here is a perfect example of the modern media .
one of the biggest problems with today 's society and media is that information is too quickly available , yes , i said too quickly available .
the media today tries to report what will give them the best ratings , period .
sometimes that means that they are reporting things before they are confirmed or are asking questions that do n't have concrete answers yet and are cause for speculation .
people and the media need to be patient and wait for things to happen before they go off and make assumptions about what has or has not happened .
as to who has one the media war - the taleban and bin laden have because we the people have let the press hand them the victory by being too impatient in waiting for results .
ww ii took 5 years + and that was when the enemy was out in the open .
today 's society wants things to happen too quickly .
mike a. , usa i believe that common people are getting frustrated because of the uncertainties posed by the current situation .
we are angry about wtc and the 6000 dead caused by an invisible enemy .
i doubt the us led alliance has a fair idea about the real culprits .
but i do support their action to go after the known terrorist groups that happen to be concentrated in afghanistan .
i think western media itself is quite frustrated because of lack of " stories " due to the secret nature of us led alliance 's operations .
on the other hand the enemy offers plenty of information for our media .
therefore , it seems as if taleban is winning the media war .
in reality , i do not believe that is the case .
irrespective of what media does , i do not believe that us led alliance will lose public support for its " war on terrorism " .
i believe us will gain overwhelming public support to deploy ground troops in afghanistan soon !
vijay , usa it 's a boring war from a media perspective pete , uk i 'm with blair on this one .
it 's a boring war from a media perspective .
our reporters have had their fun creeping in trenches and disguising themselves as women , and now their main gambit to retain interest is to whip up controversy .
pete , uk while i support freedom of the press , i am disconcerted by the irresponsible behaviour of several american media outlets .
its sensationalism over anthrax in this country is at a ridiculous level .
the members of the media here have shown themselves to be the impatient ones concerning the war 's progress .
the president of abc news in new york said on monday that he did n't feel like he should have an opinion about the validity of the pentagon as a terrorist target .
members of the media have taken relativism , renamed it objectivity , and turned it into a religion .
patrick , usa the media should support military action .
no other nation tries so hard to avoid civilian casualties as the us .
let 's not forget our objective - to rid the world of terrorism .
some casualties , both civilian and military are unavoidable .
pam martin , usa this could be asking for the impossible , but i would appreciate the media reporting unbiased facts in order to enable me to draw my own conclusions .
give the people the facts - yes , that means the good , bad , and ugly , and let the people make their own analysis of the information .
vriana , usa the incessant analysis , discussion and speculation on the news does no good for anyone linda , uk how can the government be supposed to run an effective military campaign when they have to condense every one of their decisions and actions into an easily palatable soundbite to appease the masses ?
we should be told the truth but the incessant analysis , discussion and speculation on the news does no good for anyone .
all it serves to do is spread panic and falsehood .
tell us what we need to know and then leave the people who -lrb- we hope -rrb- know what they are doing to get on with things .
after all , as the media were keen to tell us after the election , this government had a huge majority of popular support .
now it 's time for all those who voted for them to stand by their decisions .
linda , uk why does the media only show the results of supposed targeting errors on the part of the us and its allies ?
no one can or does verify the claims of the taliban .
so the media is guilty of spreading taliban propaganda .
edward zembrzuski , usa the behaviour of the us media as an instrument of war is so transparent rose raimondo , us the media has an obligation to report the facts .
the us media , in particular the ny times , has betrayed its readership horribly .
an anti-war rally held in ny city on 10/27 focused on the media repression .
some referred to it as " diabolical " .
the behaviour of the us media as an instrument of war is so transparent .
i wo n't buy a us newspaper for that reason .
they wo n't get my money to deliver non-information and propaganda .
it 's especially frightening in america where to not be flag-waving war supporter is to be accused of being a hater of america .
this is an outrage !
rose raimondo , us i 've lived in a country under an authoritarian government style where media could n't inform the truth .
so we only knew what our government wanted us to know .
but , thank god , now it 's better .
i just do n't want the world leaders to act the same as my ex-government .
just let people know where the world they live is going to and let them make up their own mind .
it 's not only the life of the people out there , but it 's about our life too .
desi ardz , indonesia war is n't attractive and should never be presented as such .
chris , uk we must support a free press / media and the ideas this represents sanj , uk we must support a free press / media and the ideas this represents .
i am a supporter of the war , but do find myself questioning the tone of some of the reporting .
we are only getting one side of this story .
western governments can say what they like , but western press is free to question this .
we can not say the same for the arab satellite channel that regularly reports from afghanistan .
it is censored and is only taken to where the taliban wants it to report from .
why then do we not discount its reports , instead of flashing them around the free world as fact ?
our free media needs to question the motives behind these reports and continue to show what the taliban are really like - vicious killers with scant regard for their own people .
sanj , uk it 's not about forgetting september 11th , but the fact that we assume that civilian casualties are part and parcel of this " war on terrorism " -lrb- in reality it is n't , just look at who 's been affected , the afghans and not terrorists -rrb- is sickening in itself .
the media should play an important role in condemning this pointless war and focusing on the fact that what the afghan people are experiencing is blood revenge acted out by americans and sadly us british , too .
i am ashamed to be part of this country .
james , chester , uk any sensible person must have condemned the september 11th terrorist acts , and must condemn the terrorist act of killing innocent afghans .
but remember you can only do that after having received unbiased reports from the media .
please let the media do their noble job with no interference .
mbondela , a. , tanzania dealing with the influence of the media is a good example of the difficulties a democracy faces when it wages war .
if the us is so bent on defending its core values like democracy , it should recognise the fact that it is democracy itself that gives the media their role .
instead of blaming the media , they should just accept that complexity .
bart van der griendt , the netherlands news reports are soaked with anti-islamic ideas junaid alam , uk thanks to electronic and print media to bolster support for anti-west opinion .
this is made possible through their vividly biased , anti-islamic reporting .
their news reports , let alone their editorial , are soaked with their anti-islamic ideas .
this makes readers and audience , especially muslims , more and more against these so-called free , just and democratic nations .
when they report taliban atrocities , they have all sources to confirm those reports .
but when they publish western atrocities and massacre , they do n't have any independent source to confirm .
junaid alam , uk i agree with terry .
the media are forgetting the 11th september and forgetting that the taliban wo n't even let them in to report on what is actually happening .
they are being used !
of course the media was always used in war - look at the d-day deception in ww2 - but for the first time it appears that our own media is succumbing to the taliban manipulation .
i do n't support the actions of the us and uk to date but regardless of that our media has privileges beyond most , but with them comes responsibilities .
even today on the tv i see them reporting on a confirmed us special forces base camp in northern afghanistan !
if i was a us general i would be furious , one media group just put his men in more danger just so they could get higher ratings .
absolutely disgusting .
the british media have been a disgrace this last few weeks .
if any allied soldier dies as a result of irresponsible reporting i would lock up the editor and close the organisation employing him forever .
even the bbc are not without some blame on this although they are not as bad as most .
gareth , uk if any journalist risks the life of any of our troops they should be imprisoned for treason terry amis , uk we are at war .
careless talk costs lives .
if any journalist risks the life of any of our troops they should be imprisoned for treason and the paper they work for shut down .
get it straight .
on september 11th , 6000 innocent people were massacred intentionally by al queda and the taleban monsters that support it .
over the past few weeks there have been unintentional civilian casualties of war , they are regrettable but they are a fact of life .
if we do nothing , next time it may be 60000 .
hard but true terry amis , uk glancing through some of the comments posted below criticising the media coverage of civilian suffering in afghanistan ... it begs the question , ' are you afraid to consider the consequences of war but just blindly follow your politicians ? '
this is a war against a figurehead enemy , carried out to satisfy popular opinion as the real perpetrators of the terrorist actions can not be targeted by our armed forces .
the civilian casualties can not be ignored ... how many are acceptable , 1 , 10 , 100 or 5000 ?
rob , uk the media is key , but the uk popular press is not the main issue .
the reason that the very phrase ' war on terrorism ' is so clearly idiotic and oxymoronic is that an act of domineering aggression is the best possible way to provoke further terrorist attacks .
if the perception in the islamic world is that the campaign in afghanistan is just one more arrogant , insensitive act of colonialism then i 'd guess this campaign is more likely to encourage future atrocities - like the massacre in pakistan - than prevent them .
the popular press , public opinion and elite opinion in the islamic world are what the government needs to be scrutinising , more urgently so than the views in our liberal press .
darien pugh , england with mr bush telling the world : " there is no evidence suggesting a connection between the anthrax cases and the terrorist attacks .
but bin laden is an evil man .
he is capable of anything .
he is behind the anthrax attacks " and the chief of british defence staff claiming that the war could go on for fifty years , the taleban do not need any sophisticated western spin doctors to run their media war !
mohansingh , india the media have exploited all angles on the war to the brink of tedium , and now all that there is left to pursue is the " you 're not winning fast enough " slant .
there is clearly a long-term plan behind the whole operation , and any media hacks who expected a quick fix are quite frankly stupid .
let the government play out the war in the way that it sees fit - and then be judged at the end .
rodger edwards , uk in a war , the role of an objective media is even more crucial yusuf nabee , south africa i completely agree that the media 's role is merely to inform the public so that they can form their own opinions .
coming from a country where the media was traditionally used to enforce government opinion on the public for many years , i must stress how important it is for the media to remain objective and credible .
if not , then the media is nothing more than a voice of government and merely serves to distribute propaganda .
in a war , the role of an objective media is even more crucial and the question that should be asked of government is : " how can the government guarantee the objectivity of the media ? " , rather than " how can the government use the media to promote their cause ? "
yusuf nabee , south africa in many ways this conflict is exposing the limitations of the 24/7 news model .
in the absence of facts -lrb- apart from claim and counter claim -rrb- , we instead get speculation , recycled conspiracy theories -lrb- last week it was a war against islam , now its apparently about an oil pipeline -rrb- , dubious experts and an expectation of immediate results .
the fact that some media outlets are now talking of a " quagmire " after only 3 weeks of military action is perhaps an inevitable result of replaying the same stories over and over again , giving rise to a yearning for something new and exciting to happen .
kw , uk i 'm sure the taliban are winning the popularity battle that 's the only reason our government is complaining about the media .
i think they should address the public concern rather than quashing it , is n't that what makes us different from those we are fighting ?
as a tax paying british citizen i would like to make my own mind about this war .
governments often claim successes that later turn out to be incorrect .
the government claims that their targeting is very precise , but we know this is not true .
terrorism must be eradicated , but the tactics deployed must be correct as well .
we must never give blank cheques to governments especially when it involves the killing of innocent people .
every war is different and must be given due consideration .
there is growing scepticism that recent wars have been waged purely for oil and this is no exception .
we could have overthrown saddam hussein 11 years ago , but we did n't , instead we have killed 200,000 iraqi soldiers and 1.5m iraqis through sanctions .
is this moral ?
no .
we do it in order to control the oil supplies of the middle east .
stuart , uk sometimes people knowing the truth hurts the government .
it 's about time this government learned that we voted for them to represent us and not to shield us from the facts of a fast becoming military debacle .
paul atkins , uk i think there is too much media emphasis on showing civilian casualties in afghanistan .
night after night we see long tv news articles about the bombing of civilians but no mention of whether they were near the target .
will the media show night after night the effects of september 11th and other terrorist atrocities on those who are maimed or whose families have lost loved ones ?
i think not .
any casualties are regrettable but let 's remember , they could have been avoided if bin-laden had been handed over , but they were never going to .
lets see more balanced journalism please .
m.lunnon , england since we -lrb- the public -rrb- are not at the war front therefore our sole representatives are the media and not the usa president , uk prime minister and not their ministers .
i would prefer to make up my own mind through reading the news and seeing the television news from various countries dealing with reports about the war .
after three weeks of bombing they have only killed innocent people of afghanistan and they want to continue bombing during ramadan and kill more afghan people who follow islam .
it seems that usa and uk are losing both the battle and the war .
they can not find bin laden and they have to stop killing innocent people .
dr.khamis , sweden the media is winning the war almost single-handedly for the terrorists .
disturbing images of human suffering and pain portrayed by the media is causing a general lack of support for military action against the taleban .
if the media keeps showing these images then no doubt the bombing will cease and the taleban and other terrorist organisations throughout the world will be free to commit more disgusting attacks against innocent civilians like those of september 11th .
s thomas , uk / aus the western media is unwittingly serving the interests of the taleban eric , dominica if we consider the media war to be between the taleban and the usa and its allies , then i 'd say that the latter are losing .
not necessarily because of the propaganda skills of the taleban , but more due to the fact that the massive 24-hour western media coverage allows the allied politicians and experts adequate rope with which to hang themselves .
anytime you talk so much , you invariably express some untruths which decreases your credibility .
also , the tv ratings would drop if the media did not include real news of afghan suffering and instead focused on suspect black and white footage of american smart bombs hitting some dots .
the western media therefore is unwittingly serving the interests of the taleban .
eric , dominica i can not believe the hypocrisy of the so-called leaders of the democratic nations .
freedom is what they say they are defending with the war against terrorism .
but where is our freedom of speech now ?
what they are guilty of is suppression of free speech and censorship of the media .
i believe this is against the constitution of the united states and this very act is what middle eastern countries are denounced for in the west .
i want to know now why the killing of innocent afghans should be hidden from us .
laila , uk the media in the us is independent as long as it is a matter of internal affairs .
for example , pundits were allowed to give any point of view they wanted when it came to clinton 's sex scandal .
but when it comes to foreign policies , american media is fully controlled by the government .
otherwise they would tell the people about how sanctions killed a huge number of people in iraq , and about 10 percent of the north korean population .
i have never heard the expression economic terrorism on tv , but i hear this used by an independent american radio network .
in my opinion , the us media is serving the government while trying to calm the people of america , but on the other side it betrays americans by not telling them the truth .
for this reason , unfortunately , many uninformed muslims think that all americans are bad .
i live in the us and i know american people are innocent but this may not be true for the government and unfortunately americans do not know everything their government does outside of its borders .
iqbal , usa the politicians in the us side seem to be losing the media war by making ambiguous statements .
donald rumsfeld , for example , alleges that the taleban are hiding among the civilians .
he further adds : " brave people give their lives for their cause " , thereby admitting that the taleban do have a cause .
what about american pilots ?
would they dare to come down a little bit and hit their targets accurately ?
irfan haqqee , toronto , canada as far as i can see , the media is only expressing widespread ambivalence about this war .
the uk government embarked upon it without any mandate from the public whose collective views it is theoretically supposed to represent .
ray , uk if it were not for the media , all we would hear is unabashed one-sided propaganda mike walsh , canada i believe that the media is doing what it is supposed to be doing and that is to report the facts .
if the facts are innocent civilians being killed then it is the media 's job to report that .
we live in a democracy and are therefore entitled to voice our concerns .
i am a british ex-pat and i am ashamed of the way tony blair and his government sucks up to everything that bush does .
if it were not for the media , all we would hear is unabashed one-sided propaganda .
mike walsh , canada i think the media in the united states is creating a vietnam situation .
members of the media should leave the war to the military .
they repeatedly take the fifth amendment way too far .
i do n't think the american people are buying their criticism .
what do they really know .
they are not on the front lines but a mountaintop , they get their news from arabs who are not friendly to the usa .
they should support our boys and girls who are risking their lives to stop terrorism and stop their liberal 60s and 70s thinking .
joanne desanda , usa the military should not have to clear its plans with editors before going on a mission juan , brussels , belgium you are joking right ?
this is going to last a long time and i am sure that nobody in the media are experts on waging war , even the so-called experts that are constantly paraded in front of the cameras .
most of them i am sure have never been close to a gun in their lives .
wars are won by killing people and taking territory .
first you soften them up and then you go in .
be patient .
most of the war is being waged beyond what you can see and hear and thus it is driving the media crazy .
i 'm sorry to break the news to you but the military should not have to clear its plans with editors before going on a mission .
juan , brussels , belgium most of the messages posted here from the us and uk are criticising the media for bombing the taleban and afghanistan .
to them it would be correct if the media hid the killing of afghan children , women and innocent people who never left their villages and have nothing to do with the terrorist activities in the us .
please never forget that the media these days projects the events on a global level .
the media has to remain impartial and truthful to secure the confidence of listeners and viewers in all parts of the world .
we the people listen to bbc , cnn and others only because of the confidence we have in the validity and truth of their news and views .
but the media war has already been won by the taleban .
the us and its allies so far have not been able to show evidence of achieving the objectives of their war against the poorest nation in the world .
has bin laden been arrested , killed or even traced ?
have the taleban been toppled ?
has al-qaeda been destroyed ?
the us has no answer to these questions .
the statement by the us defence secretary saying that they might never catch bin laden is a clear indication of their failure in achieving the objective of the present bombing campaign .
zargham , pakistan anything spoken by a uk politician is an obvious attempt to defraud the public into believing that every action the west takes is justified peter , uk i think the west 's media coverage would be much better served if politicians in this country kept their mouths shut .
every time tony blair , jack straw or anyone else from the government talks to the media they erode what little credibility they have with their lies , scare mongering and inability to provide constructive arguments to back up their causes .
the west will never win the media war when almost anyone with an ounce of common sense knows that anything spoken by a uk politician with regards to this so-called war should not be taken seriously , and is an obvious attempt to defraud the public into believing that every action the west takes is justified .
peter , uk today 's media is quite biased in favour of the weaker side regardless of how wrong or atrocious that group can be .
this prevents democracies from fighting effectively against all forms of terrorism around the world .
the meek reporters are afraid to report on pro-violence , pro-bin-laden events within palestinian authority .
political correctness stops them from reporting true insights of the origins of islamic fundamentalist violence .
the media confuses the minds of people in the free world and thus plays into the hands of the destructive forces .
robert , canada i agree 100 percent with robert from canada .
the western media has proven itself to be far more interested in political correctness than in doing its job , namely reporting facts and conducting a thought-out analysis of a situation .
honestly , why should we in the west care who is winning this " media war " ?
does anyone really think that the media 's kid gloves treatment of radical islam is going to make them hate us less ?
can a more balanced approach bring back the 6,000 dead or even stave off future terrorism on the part of islamic fundamentalists ?
not a chance .
we should have the unity of purpose and trust in our freely elected governments to be secure in what our nations are doing .
just remember this , flawed though our media may be , at least it is free to express itself .
that 's a lot more than can be said for the media for many middle eastern countries .
nathan , usa a " media war " would only be applicable if you wanted one side to win .
speaking for myself , i hate politicians and the taleban equally .
martin , england does anybody really know why the uk and us are bombing afghanistan and now sending in ground troops ?
why are we killing and terrorising all these innocent people ?
it 's not to get bin laden .
even rumsfeld knows we ca n't do that .
it 's not to put an end to terrorism , everybody knows that will never happen .
perhaps the media could find out for us instead of grinding out bombing statistics or displaying what the bombers look like from beyond the target zones .
that is what the media is there for .
the problem is that most of the media reporters are poodles when faced with government spokesmen .
the media is supposed to be there to keep us fully informed .
we ca n't rely on the government for that .
more incisive questioning is needed here .
after all this government is spending our money to kill innocent people .
there are simply not enough paxmans around to pin the government down on state terrorism .
alex brown , uk we 're losing the media war because the taleban wo n't let us forget about their dead and we 've already forgotten about our own shane watts , usa in the hours following the september 11 terrorist attacks , a large banner was hung from a building overlooking ground zero .
it 's touching message " we will never forget " has now been made redundant , as seven weeks later we 've already forgotten .
this is due in large part to the media losing its focus .
when did this stop being about 6,000 victims of terrorism and start being about international politics ?
we 're losing the media war because the taleban wo n't let us forget about their dead and we 've already forgotten about our own .
shane watts , usa i think the media is being fair .
after all we practically expect the usa to bomb civilians - it is renowned for it .
it was only a matter of time then before bombs started going astray and it is good that it gets reported .
personally i think the us is making a pig 's ear of the whole thing , and i wish blair would stop sucking up and tell the us straight .
someone has to .
chris , uk i do n't believe the media has a choice in this .
it must support the us and the british military if it believes in freedom .
however , the senseless killing of wretchedly poor afghan civilians is heartbreaking .
are we fighting a war against bin laden or the taleban ?
tell us the truth if you can .
george wood , usa since the government is waging a war against afghanistan supposedly on behalf of us voters , we have a right to know the truth of what is being done " on our behalf " .
but to bomb afghan civilians in retaliation for what some misguided terrorists did makes the uk and the usa terrorists themselves .
what is interesting is to find out the real agenda behind this bombing and the trails all seem to lead to the oil refineries .
jane , uk if the us wanted to target civilians in afghanistan the civilian casualties would be in the hundreds of thousands by now .
look at how effectively the us and its allies targeted civilians during wwii in tokyo , dresden , hamburg and other axis cities .
i think some sections of the media are looking to further their careers by accentuating the so-called brutality of the us response .
roger , miami , florida , usa we should be allowed to make up our own minds about the conflict martin , uk i think that both sides of the story should be reported in a fair way .
we did not ask our pm to " stand shoulder to shoulder " with the us .
for this reason we should be allowed to make up our own minds about the conflict .
the problem with propaganda is that you always find out the truth after the conflict and then it is too late .
martin , uk the media should be providing some context for the civilian casualties rather than implying that every bomb that goes astray calls into question the basis for the action .
there has never been a war that did not involve " collateral damage " , and this is no exception .
it should also be noted that the taleban forces continue to attempt to shoot down cruise missiles and fire surface-to-air missiles of their own .
both actions also risk causing civilian casualties .
i would say to the media : stop behaving as if you have only had 30 seconds to prepare for every story , and give us some real journalism .
martin barrett , uk the media has already surrendered itself to the taleban 's agenda steve , birmingham , uk the media is , once again , a willing puppet of the enemies of the very democracy that enables it to exist in the first place .
to listen to the broadcasts and read the headlines in the usa , a general concern about anthrax has been whipped up into a panic that has left the whole nation gripped with fear .
life goes on , bio-threat or not .
as for the uk media frenzy that accompanies each bomb that goes astray - does it really believe that we are unaware that such things happen in war ?
do the reporters who dwell on the misery of these innocents really think that they are reporting anything that we did not already know ?
the anti-terror coalition with the us-uk alliance at its heart will never win the media war .
the media has already surrendered itself to the taleban 's agenda .
the public , thankfully , have more sense and know instinctively that in a fight against enemies who would not think twice about causing " collateral " or any other form of mortal damage - the fight must continue to the last .
when we win , of course , the media will be on hand to tell us all how uselessly we performed and how we could have shortened the war by years if only we 'd listened to them .
steve , birmingham , uk was n't it the media that kept everybody 's spirits up during ww2 .
maybe our war reporters should stop criticising for once and show a bit of solidarity .
sandra , uk so what is right , here ?
to inform us that mistakes have been made or mislead us with misinformation so as not to lose any support for the bombing campaign .
there is enough propaganda already and information is concealed from us so as to encourage support for the us and uk military campaign .
let us at least have a little bit of balance in this terrible situation .
after all , is this not a basic human right ?
alice , uk i personally think that downing street started losing the war the minute tony blair started acting like bush 's lap dog and entered the country into a war without asking the public their opinion as to whether we wanted to enter this war .
the government also started losing it the minute it began to act on this particular case of terrorism when it has done so little with regards to the terrorism we have suffered at the hands of the ira .
i do n't agree with the bombing .
i never agreed with going into afghanistan , but now the situation has escalated out of control .
i think the media has been scare mongering people with fears of bio-terrorism and so on , but i would rather be informed and read different opinions than suffer at the hands of labour spin doctors who have no public empathy or understanding of the people whose taxes pay their wages .
there is no winner in this situation .
real people are dying in afghanistan as we speak .
it 's simply a no win situation .
blair and bush should have accepted the taleban 's offer to hand over bin laden to a neutral country to be put on trial .
the fact that they never even considered that offer was a disgrace and nothing they do can make up for that serious lack of diplomatic judgement .
sharon b , uk in this age of information and technology we have every right to know the unprejudiced and unbiased truth .
propaganda machinery plays an active role during war times but it 's the responsibility of reporters and journalists to dig deep for the truth .
therefore , the media should only be supportive of the truth and remain unbiased and unprejudiced .
manzoor ahmed , karachi , pakistan impartial reporting should not be restricted by the government leena , uk freedom of
