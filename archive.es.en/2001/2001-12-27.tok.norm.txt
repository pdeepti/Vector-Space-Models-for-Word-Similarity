until now , the chinese people have not had access to the terms and conditions in their own language .
but according to chinese state media , the chinese version of the documents of accession have now been released on the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation 's website .
among the documents are the agreements with the us and the european union on tariff cuts , tax changes , investment liberalisation and market entry timetables which paved the way for china to join the wto .
the compromises reached could deal serious damage to china 's majority agricultural population .
and struggling state-owned businesses face a degree of genuine foreign competition for the first time , raising the spectre in many minds of rampaging unemployment .
that , say analysts , is one of the key reasons for keeping the details out of the hands of the general public till all was signed , sealed and delivered .
generally , the wto and the implications of entry remain something of a mystery among the chinese , according to recent surveys .
a poll conducted by a cabinet-level research group suggested that over 40 % of farmers between 18 and 30 years old did not know about impending wto accession .
the poll , reported in the state-owned english language paper china daily , also said more than one fiffth of businesspeople admitted they knew little or nothing about the wto .

the price of houses north of the border has risen steadily in the past year by nearly 4 % , compared with the uk average of 10 % .
the bank of scotland expects continuing economic growth and favourable housing affordability will lead to a healthy housing market in 2002 .
it predicts house price inflation of around 5 % next year , bringing scotland into line with the uk average as southern england bears the brunt of the slowdown in the national housing market .
scotland has seen slow growth in the past year whilst prices rose at a modest pace in scotland as a whole , there were a number of hotspots , with the biggest increases in stirling -lrb- 19 % -rrb- , edinburgh -lrb- 16 % -rrb- and inverness -lrb- 15 % -rrb- .
martin ellis , an economist with the bank of scotland , said he expected the gap between growth in the scottish and uk economies to narrow significantly in the new year .
he said : " while house prices have risen steadily during 2001 , the much slower growth in scotland 's economy compared with the uk as a whole has meant that prices have increased more slowly . " he said .
latest figures show the average price of a house in scotland in the third quarter of this year was 3.7 % higher than the same period in the previous year , at £ 64,700 .
the reduction in mortgage rates to their lowest level since the mid-1950s have helped to stimulate housing demand .
but factors such as deep manufacturing recession have been blamed for the relative weakness of the scottish economy .
a sharp decline in electronics production , a key part of the scottish economy , is one of the main factors behind the under performance .
scotland 's economic output - measured by gross domestic product - is predicted to increase in the range of 1 % to 1.5 % next year , which will narrow the gap with the uk average .
economists believed the underlying strength of the uk economy would help the scottish economy to also avoid a recession .
some modest improvement in growth is expected during the second half of the year as the world economy begins to recover , easing the plight of scotland 's exporters .

peter lederer , the chairman of visitscotland , said many challenges lie ahead but that the industry is well placed to fight back .
the effects of first foot-and-mouth and 11 september , against a background of a weakening global economy meant 2001 was a torrid year for many in the tourist trade .
mr lederer was speaking as new figures suggested the industry in scotland could lose as much as £ 500m from the combined effects of the catastrophes .
visitscotland estimates losses from foot-and-mouth will reach £ 350m , while the terrorist attacks will account for £ 150m .
but the tourist board chief said tourism authorities and providers were successfully " refocusing " to move forward .
mr lederer also believes the industry will benefit from a heightened awareness about its importance to the scottish economy .
he said : " scottish tourism has been operating against some very difficult trading conditions .
" an undeniable fact is that the world is getting smaller and there are more countries competing for the same customers and the competition is becoming fierce .
budget doubled " events this year have made it all the more difficult to operate and will undoubtedly have negative effects on our industry . "
he added : " to meet the enormous challenges facing scottish tourism we must pull in the same direction to achieve one common goal - that is wealth for scotland . "
visitscotland believes the need for urgent support during the foot-and-mouth crisis was recognised by the scottish executive .
as a result , visitscotland 's budget was doubled to £ 38m to help the industry fight back with campaigns and global marketing .
mr lederer said there is a pressing need for standards in scotland to be improved , but he praised those businesses which had listened to customers and acted on their comments .
" the coming year holds much potential for us .
our marketing efforts are becoming more focused and customer led , " he said .
" our new product portfolio allows us to sell scotland on a theme basis rather than on a geographical basis .
" this we know will reap the best return for scotland in markets that are already strong and will help us tap into new territories . "
visitscotland , the former scottish tourist board , has been putting together a marketing agenda for the next year , which it believes will set the industry on a " solid footing " .
the spring sees the launch of the largest ever domestic short breaks campaign , backed with £ 3m to kick start the 2002 season .
other key campaigns will target lucrative sectors such as walking , cycling , golf , sailing and genealogy .

we 're looking at basically at the entire sydney fringe being an exposure john winter , fire service spokesman police have formed a special taskforce to find those responsible .
australia 's largest city remains under a thick blanket of smoke for the third day running , as firefighters continue to battle more than 100 bush fires in new south wales which have destroyed about 150 homes and forced the evacuation of thousands .
and the fires look set to worsen , as more hot , windy weather is forecast to fan them making the next few days critical .
click here for a map of the fires threatening sydney new south wales rural fire services commissioner phil koperberg said 40 unexplained fires may have been deliberately lit .
the acting new south wales state premier , andrew refshauge , said the culprits would face the strongest penalties available .
the taskforce will involve criminal investigators , as well as forensic and psychological experts .
so far officials have made no arrests .
temporary reprieve milder weather in new south wales on thursday eased the fires temporarily , but fire chiefs say the blazes , the worst since 1994 , could still burn for up to 10 days .
a shift in the wind has driven the flames up into the blue mountains to the west of sydney , forming a front more than 25 km long .
" we 're looking at basically at the entire sydney fringe being an exposure and we 'll be working to protect properties in that area , " state rural fire service spokesman john winter said .
firefighters and residents have been able to save more than 1,100 homes .
unique conditions air pollution in sydney is reaching near record level as fires spread from north to south along the city 's western perimeter .
sydney 's famous landmark is partly obscured by smoke more than 5,000 people are working to contain the fires , and reinforcements have already been brought in from the neighbouring state of victoria , with other states expected to help .
dozens of emergency workers have been treated for minor burns and respiratory problems , but there are no reports of serious injuries .
fire brigades commissioner ian macdougall said firefighters were facing conditions unlike any ever experienced .
" the fire conditions of christmas day were unique , with the fire front moving some 60km from the mountains to the coastal regions in one day , " he said .
" another extraordinary characteristic of this fire is that the onset of night time did not bring any respite and firefighters were continuously deployed in direct property protection throughout the night into this morning . "
an unusual christmas many residents were forced to abandon christmas celebrations and spent tuesday fighting fires in their backyards in an effort to save their homes .
those living in the suburbs south of sydney have been urged to boil their drinking water after the fires affected the filtration system .
many firefighters gave up their holidays some 12,000 homes remain without power , and many towns have been isolated after roads and rail links were cut across the state .
the new south wales state government has declared at least 20 disaster zones .
towns , holiday resorts and national parks have been evacuated .
prime minister john howard has toured the waragamba area on the outskirts of sydney to see the damage for himself .
he has promised federal government aid to help the stricken region .
it is estimated the cost of the fires could top $ 25m .
despite the blaze , mr refshauge said new year 's eve celebrations around sydney harbour would go ahead .
" i believe sydney can do it ... the advice at the moment is that we can go on , " he said .

click here for a map of the fires threatening sydney new south wales rural fire services commissioner phil koperberg said 40 unexplained fires may have been deliberately lit .
the acting new south wales state premier , andrew refshauge , said the culprits would face the strongest penalties available .
the taskforce will involve criminal investigators , as well as forensic and psychological experts .
so far officials have made no arrests .
temporary reprieve milder weather in new south wales on thursday eased the fires temporarily , but fire chiefs say the blazes , the worst since 1994 , could still burn for up to 10 days .
a shift in the wind has driven the flames up into the blue mountains to the west of sydney , forming a front more than 25 km long .
" we 're looking at basically at the entire sydney fringe being an exposure and we 'll be working to protect properties in that area , " state rural fire service spokesman john winter said .
firefighters and residents have been able to save more than 1,100 homes .
unique conditions air pollution in sydney is reaching near record level as fires spread from north to south along the city 's western perimeter .
more than 5,000 people are working to contain the fires , and reinforcements have already been brought in from the neighbouring state of victoria , with other states expected to help .
dozens of emergency workers have been treated for minor burns and respiratory problems , but there are no reports of serious injuries .
fire brigades commissioner ian macdougall said firefighters were facing conditions unlike any ever experienced .
" the fire conditions of christmas day were unique , with the fire front moving some 60km from the mountains to the coastal regions in one day , " he said .
" another extraordinary characteristic of this fire is that the onset of night time did not bring any respite and firefighters were continuously deployed in direct property protection throughout the night into this morning . "
an unusual christmas many residents were forced to abandon christmas celebrations and spent tuesday fighting fires in their backyards in an effort to save their homes .
those living in the suburbs south of sydney have been urged to boil their drinking water after the fires affected the filtration system .
some 12,000 homes remain without power , and many towns have been isolated after roads and rail links were cut across the state .
the new south wales state government has declared at least 20 disaster zones .
towns , holiday resorts and national parks have been evacuated .
prime minister john howard has toured the waragamba area on the outskirts of sydney to see the damage for himself .
he has promised federal government aid to help the stricken region .
it is estimated the cost of the fires could top $ 25m .
despite the blaze , mr refshauge said new year 's eve celebrations around sydney harbour would go ahead .
" i believe sydney can do it ... the advice at the moment is that we can go on , " he said .

security company mcafee has launched a subscription service that uses the web to protect a pc against viruses and attacks by computer vandals .
for a monthly fee , subscribers get anti-virus software and a firewall designed to keep personal information on a pc secure .
research commissioned by mcafee has revealed that many net users are not doing enough to protect themselves against the most common types of attacks .
hack attacks atri chatterjee , a spokesman for mcafee , said although a lot of people used stand-alone anti-virus programs many forgot to update them regularly , leaving them vulnerable to viruses that exploited recently found loopholes .
three out of four people are surfing naked and are open to all kinds of hacking attempts atri chatterjee , mcafee even those who used a personal firewall to protect themselves and their computer from unwelcome intruders could be caught out by the sheer number of security vulnerabilities and patch programs that were reported every week , he said .
a study by anti-virus company messagelabs found that the number of viruses circulating on the net has leapt in the last year .
in 2000 , messagelabs was stopping a virus every 700 e-mails .
now , the figure is one virus in every 370 messages .
research has found that those who use broadband net connections are at real risk of attack from malicious hackers and computer vandals .
because broadband connections are " always on " , attackers typically have more time to find and try to penetrate computers linked to the net in this way .
computers online via a broadband link have proved very popular with vandals who use them as proxies to carry out " denial of service attacks " in which a target machine is bombarded with bogus data packets .
remote control for £ 17.95 a year , mcafee will take on the burden of updating anti-virus software for customers to ensure that they stay protected against viruses .
for an extra £ 20.95 per annum , subscribers get a firewall managed remotely by mcafee that keeps out those that want to harvest personal information from a computer or recruit that machine for a future attack .
both programs are updated , managed and monitored via the web by mcafee .
" three out of four people are surfing naked and are open to all kinds of hacking attempts , " said mr chatterjee .
the mcafee security subscription service has been running in the us since april 1999 and now has more than 1.2 million customers .
the service is available now in the uk and germany and will be rolled out to 12 more countries in 2002 .

the bird is the aquatic warbler , a globally endangered species chiefly confined to eastern europe .
the warblers ' main breeding sites are known , but no-one has yet found where they spend the winter .
that knowledge could improve the prospects for conserving the birds .
the warblers breed mainly in poland , belarus and ukraine , with smaller numbers in lithuania and hungary .
much of eastern europe has lost key bird habitats since 1945 , largely because of drainage schemes .
ornithologists think there may be some unknown breeding populations , possibly in siberia .
the birds are believed to winter in the wetlands of west africa south of the sahara desert , but only one warbler has ever been caught there .
permanent record greater certainty would make it possible to give the species better protection against the main threats to the african wetlands - drainage , encroachment by farming , and the spread of the desert .
scientists at the uk 's royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- are working with colleagues in several other european countries on the problem .
they are concentrating on a study of stable isotopes - atoms of the same type but with different masses - and trace elements in the birds ' feathers .
the rspb says : " when feathers grow , concentrations of elements and ratios of stable isotopes deposited within them reflect the elemental and isotopic profiles of the environment in which they were grown , and these remain constant throughout the lifetime of the feather .
" as aquatic warblers grow their tail and wing feathers in africa , feathers taken from adult birds on migration or at their breeding grounds will tell us something about their african wintering quarters .
" the element and isotopic signatures of these feathers should be similar to those in feathers of resident african warblers occupying similar areas .
" feathers collected from recently fledged warblers on their natal grounds in europe , and from young birds on autumn migration , will allow us to identify the breeding origin of the migrating birds . "
the team has already collected feathers from a range of surrogate species around lake chad in nigeria , and is looking for further sites where warblers may be wintering .
feathers unruffled dr debbie pain of the rspb told bbc news online : " all inert tissue , like feathers , hair and nails , will show what isotopes were present when it was formed .
" with this research , all you need is to snip off the end of one tiny feather - we 're not engaged in a mass feather-pulling exercise .
" so far we 've found that birds from poland winter somewhere different from those hatched in belarus and ukraine .
" because it 's fairly easy to catch juvenile birds flying out of europe , it should be relatively simple to identify any new breeding grounds .
" but finding where the warblers winter will be harder , because it 's more difficult to get feathers from surrogate species .
antarctic puzzle " we 're also hoping to discover whether all the birds migrate on the same route through france and spain .
" if we find any whose feather profiles do n't fit , we may find not only new populations but new migration routes as well .
" isotopes tell you a lot about diet - they 're a reminder that ' you are what you eat ' .
" they 're also being used to research what 's happening to rockhopper penguins . "
