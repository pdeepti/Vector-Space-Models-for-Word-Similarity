below is the full text of his videotaped statement : " praise be to god , the cherisher and sustainer of the worlds , and may god 's peace and blessings be upon our prophet muhammad , may he and all his household and companions be blessed by god .
al-qaeda stresses that the blood of those killed will not go to waste " based on the questions and queries that we have received regarding how we view the incidents that have taken place over the past five days , we would like to say that the crusade spearheaded by the two crusaders bush and blair is continuing on the territory of muslim afghanistan and its population , who are demonstrating day in and day out their sacrifices , firmness and determination to uphold their religion and creed .
" we pray to the almighty god to hold their feet firmly , to strengthen their resolve , and to grant them victory over the infidels .
" we also would like to declare our full support for this emirate and for the muslim afghan people in the face of this ferocious assault , offering all the material and moral resources that we have under the command of mullah muhammad omar , commander of the faithful , may god protect him and grant him certain victory .
" this holds true regardless of the duration of the war .
the issue at hand is the issue of an entire nation that opposes humiliation and subservience under the yoke of us arrogance and jewish persecution .
" the al-qaeda organization declares that bush senior , bush junior , clinton , blair and sharon are the arch-criminals from among the zionists and crusaders who committed the most heinous actions and atrocities against the muslim nation .
" they perpetrated murders , torture and displacement .
millions of muslim men , women and children died without any fault of their own .
" al-qaeda stresses that the blood of those killed will not go to waste , god willing , until we punish these criminals .
' enduring freedom ' " bush , in the midst of his arrogance , media frenzy , and the enduring freedom that he boasts about must not forget the video footage of muhammad al-durrah -lsb- a palestinian child killed by israeli troops in the early days of the palestinian intifada in the gaza strip -rsb- and his brothers , muslim children in palestine and iraq .
" if he forgot that scene , then we will never forget it .
he must know that his ' enduring freedom ' which he boasts of has wiped out entire villages in nangahar near jalalabad in afghanistan .
" villages were completely wiped out .
it was not a mistake but a deliberate action .
what mistake is that which is repeated three times ?
" this village was bombed in the beginning of night , in the middle of the night , and before dawn .
" those who supported this crusader campaign should realise after things have been clarified that it is a crusader campaign against islam and the muslims .
" those who supported those criminals go away from prophet muhammad , may god 's peace and blessings be upon him , who said that the destruction of earth is more tolerable to god than killing a believer without cause .
" what would they say when their deeds are displayed in front of god , praise be to him ?
what would they say when the female infant buried alive is questioned ?
' leave the arabian peninsula ' " in this regard , we support the religious rulings issued by senior clerics in the kingdom of saudi arabia , led by his eminence shaykh humud bin-uqlah al-shu 'aybi , who said that it is impermissible to co-operate with jews and christians and that he who co-operates with them and gives them his opinion or take actions in supporting them becomes apostate and revokes his faith in god and his prophet , may god 's peace and blessings be upon him .
" al-qaeda organisation orders the americans and the infidels in the arabian peninsula , particularly the americans and the british , to leave the arabian peninsula .
" if the mothers of these need their sons then they should ask them to leave the arabian peninsula , because the land will be set on fire under their feet , god willing .
" in this regard we greet the mujahidin youths who knew their role and the way to respond to the aggression of the unjust , and killed them .
" we also greet the muslims , both in the east and west , who staged demonstrations rejecting this criminal aggression , repression , and injustice .
this truth shows that bush is an agent of israel and sacrifices his people and his country 's economy for those and helps them occupy the muslims ' land and persecute their sons " we say to them that they should continue this pressure , especially since the islamic countries ' foreign ministers announced their support for this unjust campaign .
" these do not represent the nation in any case .
they do not have the legitimacy that qualifies them to dispose of the nation 's destiny and resolutions .
" as for the decisions made by bush and the us administration to prevent satellite channels and world news agencies from making our voice heard in the world , then this is clear evidence that the us administration fears the revelation of the truth that led to the tuesday events .
" this truth shows that bush is an agent of israel and sacrifices his people and his country 's economy for those and helps them occupy the muslims ' land and persecute their sons .
' aircraft storm ' " finally , i address the us secretary of state , who cast doubt about my previous statement and downplayed what we said that there are thousands of muslim youths who are eager to die and that the aircraft storm will not stop , god willing .
" powell , and others in the us administration , know that if al-qaeda organisation promises or threatens , it fulfils its promise or threat , god willing .
" therefore , we tell him tomorrow is not far for he who waits for it .
what will happen is what you are going to see and not what you hear .
" and the storms will not calm , especially the aircraft storm .
we also say and advise the muslims in the united states and britain , the children , and those who reject the unjust us policy not to travel by plane " these storms will not calm until you retreat in defeated in afghanistan , stop your assistance to the jews in palestine , end the siege imposed on the iraqi people , leave the arabian peninsula , and stop your support for the hindus against the muslims in kashmir .
" we also say and advise the muslims in the united states and britain , the children , and those who reject the unjust us policy not to travel by plane .
" we also advise them not to live in high-rise buildings and towers .
" but honour belongs to god , and his apostle , and to the believers ; but the hypocrites know not .
" peace and god 's blessings be upon you . "

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- military campaign : one week on categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : americas front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 14 october , 2001 , 06:16 gmt 07:16 uk military campaign : one week on the us has claimed air supremacy in first week by military analyst dr john gearson in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on new york and washington , george bush declared a " war on terrorism " .
one week into the military phase of hostilities , how is that war going and to what extent have the alliance 's objectives been met ?
making an assessment was always going to be difficult , not least as us objectives have not really been declared .
but it is made more difficult by the fact that the war is one of the most starkly " asymmetric " conflicts of modern times .
it is asymmetric because a first world military is having to adapt its strategies and tactics to a developing world conflict in which the opponent will be seeking to exploit any weakness that presents itself from the american side , but otherwise will avoid any direct military clashes .
the us insists the targets are all military the initial focus of the anglo-american action has been on a fairly traditional air campaign , although not an especially large one compared with previous conflicts .
mindful of the political costs in causing any significant civilian casualties , the americans have expended their efforts on conventionally identifiable military assets , avoiding normal infra-structure targets such as roads and bridges .
however , in trying to destroy deep reinforced bunkers and command centres they may have to adopt targeting strategies and weapons which by their nature are less discreet and therefore more dangerous to civilians .
' supremacy ' not ' command ' the target set used by the planners appears to have begun , predictably enough , with those taleban assets that can pose a threat to the us and coalition forces themselves - surface to air missiles , radar facilities and command and control functions - what is known as a counter-air campaign .
the problem for the americans is that this is an asymmetric conflict and the taleban have not come out to fight .
after initially declaring that " command " of the air had been achieved , us commanders soon declared that " control " of the air had been achieved .
the northern alliance is also fighting against the taleban the danger that the taleban may still have military assets which could threaten their forces has led the us leadership to drop the term " control " of the air and instead focus on " air supremacy " as their initial achievement .
hence what to the outsider appears to be the bombing of bomb sites may in fact be an attempt to root out the assets which have not yet presented themselves .
the other targets have been bin laden 's network of bases , training facilities and previously known locations which have been struck to little obvious effect as yet .
' ground action ' however , this does not mean that american objectives are not being met , since the ability of the organisation to function in any meaningful way is likely to have been severely degraded and will remain so as long as the air campaign continues .
strategically , george bush 's campaign will only be deemed a success if the military strikes succeed in " smoking out " the terrorists from their tunnels and bunkers .
how this may be achieved through air power alone is unclear and hence the focus on some sort of ground action to come .
much has been written of the special forces ' role to date , but it is in the next phase that special forces - or more broadly elite units - may make a decisive contribution , possibly through quite extensive search and destroy missions against suspected terrorist and taleban strongholds .
this may require bases to be established at least temporarily in afghanistan itself , a politically and logistically tricky undertaking .
' risks ' the only way that this may be avoided is if the taleban regime implodes under the combined pressure of american air strikes and ground action by anti-taleban forces in afghanistan .
the problem is that everyone , including the taleban and their opponents , is waiting for some sort of american intervention on the ground with all its attendant risks .
it is in this respect that george bush has mentioned avoiding repeating the mistakes of vietnam - although america has since won a war in the gulf , exorcising some of those vietnam ghosts .
following 11 september the american people may accept nothing less than total victory , thanks in part to the expectations the bush administration has raised of winning the war on terrorism and so a new and more dangerous stage in military operations may be unavoidable .
if ground action is initiated , the military will need to be given specific objectives to meet and a minimum of political interference in achieving them - fine , except that is very unlikely in this most political of wars .

one week into the military phase of hostilities , how is that war going and to what extent have the alliance 's objectives been met ?
making an assessment was always going to be difficult , not least as us objectives have not really been declared .
but it is made more difficult by the fact that the war is one of the most starkly " asymmetric " conflicts of modern times .
it is asymmetric because a first world military is having to adapt its strategies and tactics to a developing world conflict in which the opponent will be seeking to exploit any weakness that presents itself from the american side , but otherwise will avoid any direct military clashes .
the initial focus of the anglo-american action has been on a fairly traditional air campaign , although not an especially large one compared with previous conflicts .
mindful of the political costs in causing any significant civilian casualties , the americans have expended their efforts on conventionally identifiable military assets , avoiding normal infra-structure targets such as roads and bridges .
however , in trying to destroy deep reinforced bunkers and command centres they may have to adopt targeting strategies and weapons which by their nature are less discreet and therefore more dangerous to civilians .
' supremacy ' not ' command ' the target set used by the planners appears to have begun , predictably enough , with those taleban assets that can pose a threat to the us and coalition forces themselves - surface to air missiles , radar facilities and command and control functions - what is known as a counter-air campaign .
the problem for the americans is that this is an asymmetric conflict and the taleban have not come out to fight .
after initially declaring that " command " of the air had been achieved , us commanders soon declared that " control " of the air had been achieved .
the danger that the taleban may still have military assets which could threaten their forces has led the us leadership to drop the term " control " of the air and instead focus on " air supremacy " as their initial achievement .
hence what to the outsider appears to be the bombing of bomb sites may in fact be an attempt to root out the assets which have not yet presented themselves .

ulysses , launched in 1990 , has been this way before , circling the sun in a wide orbit .
it measures the stream of particles thrown out by our star called the solar wind .
ulysses ' track allows the probe to sample the different properties the wind displays in different directions .
it is the first spacecraft to explore interplanetary space at such high solar latitudes .
ulysses orbits the sun at a distance that varies from just more than one to five times the sun-earth distance -lrb- 149 million kilometres or 93 million miles -rrb- .
polar passage although ulysses was built to study the sun , the closest the probe has ever been to the star was when it was being constructed on earth .
after launch , ulysses headed towards jupiter - away from the sun - and used jupiter 's gravity to alter the craft 's trajectory to swing above the orbits of the planets and over the poles of the sun .
over the next few years , the sun 's activity will decline ulysses has already passed over the poles twice , discovering that the solar wind comes in two forms : a slow wind at the sun 's equator , and a fast wind at its poles .
ulysses will complete its north polar passage on 10 december , when it passes 70 degrees north solar latitude on the other side of the sun .
then , for the second time during its 11-year lifetime , the probe will head out towards jupiter 's orbit on the long leg of its six-year circuit around the sun .
the spacecraft will continue to monitor the sun 's outpourings as solar activity calms down from the maximum level activity it has experienced this year through to its quiet period - the next solar minimum - due in a few years .

the rose , where many of william shakespeare 's plays were first performed , was rediscovered in 1989 .
it is the only elizabethan theatre left in the world of which there are substantial remains .
english heritage have now put up £ 17,500 for a preliminary excavation of the site after timber planks and posts were found to be well- preserved .
mike corfield , chief scientist for english heritage , said : " it would be magnificent to see th site properly explored and put on show to the public . "
the results could lead to important light being shed on the history of elizabethan theatre , one of britain 's greatest contributions to world culture baroness tessa blackstone a trust has been set up to campaign for a full excavation of the site near southwark bridge .
the rose opened in 1587 but was closed in 1605 after staging plays by shakespeare and others such as christopher marlowe and thomas kyd .
baroness tessa blackstone , minister for the arts , said she was encouraged by what she saw at the site .
" the results could lead to important light being shed on the history of elizabethan theatre , one of britain 's greatest contributions to world culture . "
in 1989 more than half of the rose 's remains were discovered during the development of an office block .
a campaign at the time saved them from being destroyed and since then they have been preserved under layers of concrete , sand and water .
the newly-built globe theatre , which is a reconstruction of an elizabethan open-air theatre , was modelled on the remains of the rose .
