analysts had been expecting growth , but the scale of the increase beat most forecasts , which averaged 7 % .
the firm said it expected full-year 2001 profit and sales to be higher than last year .
the group 's benchmark real internal growth rate was 4.6 % , up from 4.5 % a year ago , and above its own long-term target of 4 % .
first-half net income rose to 3.15bn swiss francs -lrb- £ 1.3bn ; $ 1.9bn -rrb- , from 2.8bn francs a year ago .
the firm said that its $ 10bn takeover of us pet food producer ralston purina was on track to close before the end of this year .
the company said that its profit margin , at 10.5 % , was a shade lower than last year 's .
the main reason was the one-off impact of an accounting change , and the cost of implementing the firm 's globe operational efficiency and performance programme .
globe will cost 250m francs a year until 2005 , and will yield benefits that will reach 3bn francs by 2006 , the firm said .
marketing spend also rose as a result of investment in brands and the launch of new products .
the company 's main areas of growth were asia , oceania and africa , where the firm achieved more than 7 % internal growth .
in the developed markets of europe and the us , growth was below 3 % .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- imf agrees extra cash for argentina categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 22 august , 2001 , 07:06 gmt 08:06 uk imf agrees extra cash for argentina argentina 's crisis has hit the poor hardest after 12 tense days of talks , the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- has agreed to increase its funding to crisis-hit argentina by $ 8bn .
the united states , the imf 's biggest shareholder and a vital ally of argentina , welcomed the deal .
but both the us and the imf insisted that tough conditions were tied to the money .
argentina will have to use much of the money in an exchange programme to help pay down its $ 128bn debt burden .
some $ 5bn of the money could be made available as early as september , once the imf 's board meets to approve the loan .
the new cash takes the imf 's commitments to argentina to a total of $ 22bn .
government agreement the argentine government said it agreed to the debt-exchange condition .
economy minister domingo cavallo said that the government would enter into talks with both the imf and the g7 group of industrialised countries over how best to manage the debt-swap .
cavallo : wants talks on debt swap but the government could face problems from opposition politicians in its attempts to push through imf-mandated measures .
moves to trim government spending , including cuts in state-sector wages , have already proved tricky to implement , provoking passionate demonstrations in buenos aires and elsewhere .
and the us is expected to be especially tough in policing anti-crisis measures .
us treasury secretary paul o 'neill warned that much work was needed in order to help put the country back on course for recovery .
trade ties in parallel with the imf deal , international trade officials are hoping to boost ties among latin american countries .
responding to the imf announcement , robert zoellick , the us trade representative , said he would be meeting ministers from around the region in the hope of increasing economic links .
mr zoellick is keen to arrange a meeting of ministers from mercosur , the trade bloc that comprises argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay .
country in crisis argentina 's crisis is far-reaching .
after a three-year recession and a series of domestic and international rescue packages , recent months have seen increasing speculation that the government might have to devalue the peso - currently pegged against the us dollar .
the resulting collapse in argentine financial markets has raised fears of global " contagion " across developing economies , similar to the fall-out from the russian economic crisis of 1998-99 .
international economic policymakers have been keen to argue that the danger of contagion is less now than it was in 1998 .
but emerging markets , especially those in latin america , have been nervous for most of the summer .
the latest news has provoked a rare surge of optimism among investors .
in early trading on wednesday , argentine international government bonds surged by almost 7 % . watch / listen on this story michael reid , economist magazine " it is not clear if this package in itself will bring growth " the bbc 's theo leggett " the country is suffering the effects of three years of recession " see also : 02 aug 01 -pipe- business ' give us a chance ' says argentina 30 jul 01 -pipe- americas argentina workers angry at austerity bill 21 jul 01 -pipe- americas argentines living in the shadow of debt 20 jul 01 -pipe- business argentina softens economic reforms 19 jul 01 -pipe- business argentina 's corporate bail-out 17 jul 01 -pipe- business argentine austerity plan backed 12 jul 01 -pipe- business argentina debt sparks foreign fears 20 jun 01 -pipe- business argentine currency fears grow 13 jul 01 -pipe- business argentina minister appeals for calm 20 jul 01 -pipe- business general strike paralyses argentina 06 jul 01 -pipe- country profiles country profile : argentina internet links : imf argentina 's ministry of economy us trade representative argentina 's government the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : worldcom chiefs refuse to testify buoyant ebay snaps up bills firm digital tv woes hit pace profits bush vows action after scandals merck ' exaggerated ' revenue in accounts congress pushes accounting reform oil trade thaws us-russian ties hiv : the drug firms ' quest for a cure links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .
