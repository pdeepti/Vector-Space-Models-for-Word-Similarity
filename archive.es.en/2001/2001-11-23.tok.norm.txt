non-opec producers , 2000 , million barrels per day russia : 6.5 mexico : 3.5 norway : 3.4 the sudden surge came after norway said it had agreed to mirror the behaviour of the opec cartel by reducing supply in order to boost prices .
" the government has decided that if opec and non-opec countries carry out cuts , then i have got a mandate to carry out cuts of 100,000 to 200,000 barrels a day , " norwegian oil minister einar steensnaes said .
the news prompted renewed confidence that opec will push through its own cuts which were agreed on the condition that russia , mexico and norway followed suit .
all eyes on russia norway 's decision to support opec leaves russia in the spotlight since mexico has already made a firm commitment to reduce output .
opec output , september , million barrels per day saudi arabia : 7.7 iran : 3.6 venezuela : 2.7 iraq * : 2.6 nigeria : 2.2 uae : 2.1 kuwait : 2 libya : 1.3 indonesia : 1.2 algeria : 0.8 qatar : 0.7 * excluded from opec discussions opec chief ali rodriguez has said that he was " very confident " that russia would cut production .
" we are very confident of a rational decision by president putin and the authorities in russia , " mr rodriguez said .
but analysts - and the signals from russia itself - have been mixed so far .
russian oil officials are meeting at the kremlin on friday in order to discuss a cut , but traders are sceptical of the country 's ability to enforce quota discipline .
rollercoaster prices oil prices hit a two and a half year low at the beginning of this week , slipping to $ 16.65 per barrel .
but renewed hopes of concerted action from opec has seen prices touch $ 20 per barrel on thursday .
last year , the oil price soared to more than $ 30 per barrel , prompting widespread fuel protests in september after the strong crude oil price fed through to prices at the petrol pump .
since then , a number of leading analysts have predicted that oil prices will slump back to $ 10 per barrel or even lower .
the falls stem from a huge excess of crude oil , caused largely by heavy production in recent years from the three main non-opec exporters .
this has coincided with reduced demand due to the global economic slowdown which means less fuel is burnt in factories and industrial plants around the world .
cynical view however , some cynics question whether the norwegian cuts would actually materialise , arguing that it is just a cosmetic move to appease opec .
" these are big cuts and they would be from producing oil wells .
one wonders how would the companies do this , would they be happy to shut down production that is making them money with oil prices , " leo drollas at the global centre for energy studies told the bbc 's world business report .
" you might get some cuts , but whether you get 200,000 barrels a day is a moot point , " he added .

the revised estimate by the head of the edinburgh-based national cjd surveillance unit , professor robert will , is based on the observation that most people to have died from new variant creutzfeld jakob disease -lrb- vcjd -rrb- have been relatively young .
our prediction ... lies in the ' optimistic ' end of the ranges of previously published figures research scientists the research , published in the journal science , assumes that older people are likely to be more resistant to the disease .
until recently , estimates of the number of deaths from eating infected beef have ranged from a few hundred to more than 130,000 .
latest figures from the department of health show there have been 111 confirmed or " probable " cases of vcjd since the infection was first recognised in 1996 .
contaminated meat the illness can affect patients ' speech and short-term memory and leave them requiring round-the-clock nursing care .
the relatively high incidence of the disease among young people has long been debated by doctors .
last year , dr will said meat processing methods in the 1980s might have led to contaminated beef ending up on children 's plates - a key factor in the new research by french and british scientists .
the average age of those who have died is 28 , and only a handful of victims have been older than 53 .
in contrast , 93 % of people with " classic " cjd , which occurs sporadically for no known reason and is unconnected with contaminated meat , are over 50 .

between 460,000 and 482,000 bse-infected animals were slaughtered for human consumption before the ban on high-risk offal such as brain and spinal cord was introduced in 1989 .
the number of people exposed to potentially infective doses through food may have been " extremely high " , said the scientists .
however , only genetically susceptible people - about 40 % of the population - were thought to be capable of getting the disease .

some people have seen colleagues fired at the seasonal event .
and 9 % of people questioned had handed in their notice , according to a survey by jobs.telegraph.co.uk.
nearly half of the 1000 people taking part in the survey had insulted their boss and a quarter of them had demanded a pay rise while partying .
christopher lloyd , head of jobs.telegraph.co.uk said : " obviously workers in london like to let their hair down at the office christmas party , but for many all decorum goes out of the window and the consequences can be far reaching .
thrown punches " we have always seen an increase in job hunting and job advertising in the new year - maybe these results reveal why . " 54 % of london 's festive partygoers had been caught canoodling with colleagues and 33 % had thrown punches during the celebrations .
some people had tried their hardest to avoid the office party - with 25 % lying about their whereabouts , 13 % feigning illness and 9 % even booking a holiday .
the survey shows that more than one in 10 london respondents had started a relationship at the festivities .
a quarter of the workers questioned had met their future spouse over the punch bowl and peanuts .
but there is a legal warning to all employers .

nearly half of the 1000 people taking part in the survey had insulted their boss and a quarter of them had demanded a pay rise while partying .
christopher lloyd , head of jobs.telegraph.co.uk said : " obviously workers in london like to let their hair down at the office christmas party , but for many all decorum goes out of the window and the consequences can be far reaching .
thrown punches " we have always seen an increase in job hunting and job advertising in the new year - maybe these results reveal why . " 54 % of london 's festive partygoers had been caught canoodling with colleagues and 33 % had thrown punches during the celebrations .
some people had tried their hardest to avoid the office party - with 25 % lying about their whereabouts , 13 % feigning illness and 9 % even booking a holiday .

but the humble trolley has been re-invented in an effort to stop them being removed from supermarkets .

over 200 trolleys a week used to disappear from our store allan miller asda it is fitted with a sensor which is triggered if it crosses the supermarket 's boundaries , causing a shield to drop down over the wheels and stop the runaway cart .
asda 's livingston store manager , allan miller , said the problem of abandoned trolleys littering the countryside was one of the main sources of complaints about supermarkets .
he said : " over 200 trolleys a week used to disappear from our store and would turn up elsewhere in the livingston area .

" the techno trolley system ensures that there are always plenty of trolleys available for our customers .
pilot scheme " more importantly , asda is pledging its support to help keep the surrounding areas cleaner and greener , with fewer abandoned trolleys spoiling the landscape . "
mr miller added that the trolleys would be rolled out to other asda stores in britain if the pilot scheme proved a success .
the move was backed by the keep scotland beautiful campaign , which said it would be keeping an eye on the techno trolley 's progress .
national director john summers said : " we congratulate asda for introducing this innovative scheme to tackle the abandoned shopping trolley menace .
" prevention is far better than cure and the benefits to the quality of the local environment will be welcomed by all . "

mr murphy said there was " no clamour " for extra functions and voters wanted the assembly to focus on using the powers it currentlly enjoys .
mr murphy rejected the plea from plaid currently , the assembly - which controls an annual budget of Â£ 10bn and is responsible for key public services - lacks the power to raise taxes or make its own laws , as the scottish parliament can .
when it was established in 1999 , the labour party was careful to limit the fledgling body 's powers .
the welsh secretary , who represents wales 's interests at the cabinet table in london , said the constitutional debate was " a turn-off " for most voters , who were more concerned with the key issues of schools , hospitals and the environment .
mr murphy decided to speak out after the assembly was branded a " failure " by plaid cymru leader ieuan wyn jones .
delivering the annual institute of welsh politics lecture in aberystwyth earlier this week , mr jones said the current settlement was fatally flawed and would benefit from being more closely modelled on the scottish parliament .
on friday , mr jones said mr murphy and the " dinosaur tendency " in the labour party were being left behind in the devolution debate .
" a growing number of labour ams are coming out to support a law-making parliament , because they are frustrated at the assembly 's failure to deliver in key policy areas , " he said .
welsh conservative leader nick bourne , however , dismissed the plaid calls , saying the assembly had to properly use the powers it has .
public lecture mr murphy is also determined to face down calls from within his own party for the assembly to gain legislative functions .
the labour assembly member for clwyd west , alun pugh , recently added his voice to those calling for a full welsh parliament .
he will be giving a public lecture on the subject to students at the university of glamorgan on 5 december .
and new labour mp for aberavon , hywel francis , said he was not opposed to giving the institution more power , but he claimed another referendum should be held before the constitutional settlement is changed .

the swedish newspaper dagens industry said the resignation followed talks between the wallenberg-family led investment firm investor , which holds a controlling stake in abb , and bz group , a swiss investment firm controlled by the financier martin ebner and a major owner of investor shares .
although mr barnevik 's resignation was unexpected , he has recently come under increasing criticism from shareholders following a slump in the price of abb shares .
the outgoing chairman acknowledged he was partly to blame for the decline .
" i also with my departure take my share of the responsibility for the less good performance of abb in recent years , " he said .
share price slump abb shares fell from a high of 54.50 swiss francs in february 2000 to just 9 francs early last month .
the company 's shares fell again , by 0.3 % to 17.40 francs , after mr barnevik 's departure was announced .
he will be succeeded as chairman by abb board member juergen dormann .

mr barnevik has led the company for a total of 22 years , including the eight years he spent as head of swedish firm asea before it merged with switzerland 's brown boveri to form abb .
management legend the successful completion of that merger , one of the largest ever between companies based in different countries , sealed mr barnevik 's reputation as a legend among corporate executives on a par with general electric 's jack welch .
to this day , master of business administration classes study the creation of abb as a textbook example of how to manage a cross-border merger of companies with different cultures and values .
however , abb , once the darling of european stock markets , has fallen on hard times since the onset of the global economic slowdown .
former chief executive goran lindahl , who had pledged to turn the company round , left in january this year to join the board of mining company anglo american .
burdened with a $ 6bn debt mountain , abb last month said it expects a 10 % decline in profits this year , and announced plans to lay off 12,000 jobs .

the 81-year-old pontiff transmitted the message , his first " virtual " apology , in a recent string of statements of contrition , from a laptop in the vatican 's frescoed clementine hall on wednesday .
in certain parts of oceania , sexual abuse by some clergy has caused great suffering and spiritual harm to the victims pope john paul ii reporting on a synod meeting held in 1998 , the pope wrote that bishops from the region " apologised unreservedly " for the " shameful injustices done to indigenous peoples " in australia , new zealand and the islands of the south pacific .
" the church expresses deep regret and asks forgiveness where her children have been or still are party to these wrongs , " the document said .
the report singled out the " stolen generation " of at least 30,000 aboriginal children in australia who were forcibly separated from their parents in a church-backed government attempt to educate them and assimilate them into white culture .

and in a trip to israel last year , he publicly asked god 's forgiveness for the sins of roman catholics through the ages , including wrongs inflicted on jews , women and minorities .
however , the pope stopped short of travelling to the other side of the world to deliver this message in person .
" i would have wished to visit oceania once again , " he said , " but it was not to be . "

unlike criminal funds , most terrorist finance is likely to be transferred in small amounts and come from apparently legal sources , such as charities .
this makes it unlikely to arouse any suspicion from bankers , urs roth , chief executive of the swiss bankers association told the bbc 's world business report .
" i would not be able to detect it beforehand in order to prevent the terrorist from being a terrorist and doing an attack , " he said .
finance vow in the immediate aftermath of the 11 september terrorist attacks , finance ministers and central bank governors of the g7 group of leading industrialised countries vowed to track down terrorist finances .
they wanted better exchange of information and the supervision of offshore assets to ensure there was no hiding place for terrorist money .
the anti-money laundering agency - the financial action task force - held an emergency meeting to discuss how to track down terrorist funds .
" in the usual case of money laundering , you have basically large transactions , " mr roth said .

unlike criminal funds , most terrorist finance is likely to be transferred in small amounts and come from apparently legal sources , such as charities .
this makes it unlikely to arouse any suspicion from bankers , urs roth , chief executive of the swiss bankers association told the bbc 's world business report .
" i would not be able to detect it beforehand in order to prevent the terrorist from being a terrorist and doing an attack , " he said .
finance vow in the immediate aftermath of the 11 september terrorist attacks , finance ministers and central bank governors of the g7 group of leading industrialised countries vowed to track down terrorist finances .
they wanted better exchange of information and the supervision of offshore assets to ensure there was no hiding place for terrorist money .
the anti-money laundering agency - the financial action task force - held an emergency meeting to discuss how to track down terrorist funds .
" in the usual case of money laundering , you have basically large transactions , " mr roth said .
" there a bank can become suspicious .
" in this case here , it is completely different .
you probably deal mostly with rather small amounts , which may make perfect sense . "

sir donald irvine said there is still a " deeply conservative rearguard " among doctors , during his last major speech before standing down .
he told an audience at the university of northumbria that patients are far less deferential to , and questioning of , doctors .
sir donald 's presidency has been dogged by controversy " there are still some doctors who dislike what they perceive as their authority being questioned .
" they resent the assertive patient .
" we have to end the state of affairs whereby a minority of patients have to put up with - or worse , be put at risk by - professional practices that are considered by any rational person to be dangerous , offensive or otherwise unacceptable . "
lack of humility sir donald , who is stepping down six months early , also criticised the government 's hands-on management of the nhs , calling for ministers to distance themselves from the day-to-day running of the health service .
mike stone said things were improving sir donald 's time at the top of the doctor 's regulatory body has been dogged with controversy .
questions have been raised about the profession 's ability to keep its house in order following high profile scandals such as the deaths of children at the bristol royal infirmary and the retention of organs by alder hey children 's hospital .
last year the archbishop of canterbury accused some surgeons of " lacking humility " .
dr george carey said public confidence in the medical profession had been dented by recent high profile medical scandals , including the bristol heart babies case and the conviction of serial killer gp harold shipman .
he called on doctors to " exercise humility " when making life-or-death decisions .
professor graeme catto , vice-principal of king 's college and st thomas ' hospitals medical and dental school , has been elected to take the place of sir donald as gmc president .
getting better mike stone , director of the patients association , said things were getting better , but patients were still complaining about doctors being arrogant .
" people are still very worried about seeing some doctors .
" it ca n't be applied to all doctors , but we have seen in recent cases that some doctors are even worried about speaking out against other doctors . "
mr stone said the best way to solve the problem was to give each patient more time to talk things over with their doctor .
dr vivienne nathanson , of the british medical association , said most doctors were not intentionally trying to be arrogant .
but she said sometimes the very act of trying to calm down fraught patients could be mistaken for arrogance .
she said : " doctors are working very hard to try to connect better with their patients .
