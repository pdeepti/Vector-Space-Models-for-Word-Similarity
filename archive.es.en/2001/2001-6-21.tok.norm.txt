local residents said some of the 22 cattle , killed in a field near skipton town centre , escaped from the slaughtermen and staggered around even after they had been shot .
foot-and-mouth facts total number of confirmed foot-and-mouth cases in the uk 1,771 - two on 21 june 3,393,000 animals slaughtered 8,334 premises with animals slaughtered or earmarked for slaughter the department for the environment , food and rural affairs is investigating the skipton cull and has issued animal welfare guildelines to other slaughter teams .
one skipton resident , who did not want to be named , says she was deeply distraught by what she witnessed .
she said one cow which had received a bolt to its head got up and wandered around among the dead animals before turning back towards the slaughterman to be finished off .
full inquiry on wednesday the government announced it would launch a full inquiry into the foot-and-mouth crisis as soon as the outbreak has abated .
minister for farming and the food industry , lord whitty , said an announcement would be made when it appeared the disease was close to being eradicated .
speaking at the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- offices in exeter , devon , lord whitty said : " the main priority is to ensure we are stamping down on the remaining outbreaks of the disease . "
the minister did not say if it would be a public inquiry , which farmers and other organisations , including the royal college of veterinary surgeons , have been lobbying for .
lord whitty , who toured the devon disease control centre on wednesday , said an inquiry was required to enable lessons to be learned about how the disease arrived and spread .
he said he knew the prime minister did not want the inquiry to be as long as that into the bse crisis .
" we need to learn lessons quickly , " he said , adding that it was not intended primarily to apportion blame .
the function of the inquiry would be to learn how the uk could react more effectively in a similar situation and minimise the economic effect of the disease .
future of farming in the coming weeks there will also be an announcement about the setting up of a policy commission to establish a medium-term strategy for the future of the farming industry , said lord whitty .
the minister said farmers knew that returning to normal did not mean a return to what they were doing four years ago .
" there will be changes in marketing , and in what we produce and the way we produce it , " said lord whitty .
the south-west regional director of the nfu , anthony gibson , said that a public inquiry into foot-and-mouth was " inevitable . "
" you can not possibly have the most serious outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the uk without having a public inquiry to learn lessons and make it less likely that this happens again , " he said .

mr ancram - an accomplished guitarist who , according to the daily telegraph has been known to soothe mps by playing " bridge over troubled water " - is tipped by most papers to enter the conservative leadership contest on thursday .
the telegraph sees him as the ideal " unity " candidate for a divided party - an assessment shared by the independent and the guardian .
all the papers are agreed on the motives behind his decision .
the guardian says his candidacy will " un-nerve " the front-runner , michael portillo .
the sun and the mirror are more explicit .
mr ancram , they say , is running as part of a " stop portillo " campaign , which the daily express claims , is gathering pace in senior tory circles .
public service targeted there is also a consensus that troubled waters lie ahead for tony blair after wednesday 's queen 's speech .
the sun says the prime minister has " picked a bloody fight " with vested interests in the police , schools and hospitals .
the daily mail commends mr blair for tackling his most difficult targets head-on - even at the risk of confrontation with the unions .

after a six hour debate , the lawmakers approved the bill - known as the convertibility ii - into law , effectively establishing a new exchange rate for the entire economy .
the idea is sponsored by economy minister domingo cavallo , as he struggles to shield his economy from exposure to the us and stabilise the peso .
one peso is now fixed at one dollar and will become fixed to one euro , as soon as the euro rises to parity with the dollar .
when the euro then rises or falls against the dollar , the peso will be set at the mid value between the two currencies .
seeking stability the measure is part of a larger package aimed at cutting company costs and boosting growth for latin america 's third largest economy .
argentina 's economy has been in recession for three years .
mr cavallo says the new measure is imperative for the peso 's stability .
but much smaller changes made to the currency pegging system last week was received doubtfully by the international markets .
international fears last friday mr cavallo announced that exporters and importers would be partially exempted from the mechanism by which the argentine peso is pegged against the us dollar .
financial markets , sensitive to argentine policy after a spate of dire economic news , interpreted the move as effectively a devaluation of the peso , and have this week started to pile pressure on other emerging market currencies .
mr cavallo has grown increasingly frustrated by the reaction of international markets which he blamed on ignorance .
" the behaviour of the market just shows they did not understand what we wanted to do .
but that should not surprise us .
they did n't understand -lsb- the dollar-peso peg -rsb- introduced in 1991 , " he complained .
the new euro peg approved on thursday is likely to take many months to come into effect .
the euro is now worth about 85 cents of a dollar .

having heard the queen 's speech , mps came together for light-hearted speeches from labour mps barry sheerman and david lammy .
your son is a model pupil - unfortunately he is not a working one david lammy recounting his school report the two men , representing old and new blood in the house , were chosen to kick off the new parliamentary term by making what is traditionally known as the loyal address .
mr sheerman , who represents the huddersfield constituency , congratulated tony blair for becoming only the second labour leader to win two consecutive general elections after harold wilson .
unfortunately this was not entirely accurate - he forgot clement attlee who twice won general elections for labour in 1945 and 1950 and whose time as prime minister saw the creation of the health service .
fortunately his colleagues - or comrades as mr sheerman addressed them - were as ignorant of labour party history as he was .
the mp had a serious message about the lack of interest in westminster politics as evidenced by the turnout at the general election , however .
he said : " if we do n't look at the future of our house , the future of parliament in the 21st century , we are going to be neglecting our jobs as politicians .
" we neglect both of these at out peril and we owe it to ourselves and the future of parliamentary democracy and our constituents to meet this challenge . "
after that mr lammy clearly saw it as his duty to inject the lighthearted bit into the occasion .
the tottenham mp , who succeeded the late bernie grant in a by-election after that legendary member died suddenly , said his own gateway to success was through education , although he indicated he had often been a very average pupil .
the 28-year-old barrister compared being called to the chief whips office on tuesday to be asked to make the humble address with being called to see the headmistress as a seven-year-old pupil at a new school .
on that occasion he arrived in the head teacher 's office fearing an early appointment with her slipper and was told to remove his coat and wait for 10 minutes .
in his trepidation the mp misheard her , thinking that she said ' remove your clothes ' .
admitting exposure " to this day i recall with horror the look on both our faces -lsb- when she returned -rsb- , " he said .
mr lammy said that his mother had recently shown him an old school report .
it read : " your son is a model pupil - unfortunately he is not a working one . "
but despite the difficulties , education had been his gateway to success , he said .
mr lammy also used the opportunity of his speech to raise the issue of multiculturalism .
as one of only a handful of ethnic minority mps , he said he looked forward to the day when he no longer stood out in the commons .
he said : " i look forward to the day when women and black people will not stand out on these benches and this house will truly be a house of representatives . "
he believed that the house of commons and a labour government were the way forward to build a cohesive society - even if parliament did sometimes seem out of step with the rest of the country .
slow train to illustrate the point he told an anecdote recounted to him by a woman at a recent constituency surgery who described being on a very slow train in her native jamaica .
an irate american tourist stormed up the carriage and asked the driver if he could go any faster .
" i can go faster but i 've got to stay with the train , " said the driver .
equally the commons was the " only vehicle " for delivering necessary change in the uk , mr lammy said .

" we neglect both of these at out peril and we owe it to ourselves and the future of parliamentary democracy and our constituents to meet this challenge . "
after that mr lammy clearly saw it as his duty to inject the lighthearted bit into the occasion .
mr lammy paid tribute to the late bernie grant the tottenham mp , who succeeded the late bernie grant in a by-election after that legendary member died suddenly , said his own gateway to success was through education , although he indicated he had often been a very average pupil .
the 28-year-old barrister compared being called to the chief whips office on tuesday to be asked to make the humble address with being called to see the headmistress as a seven-year-old pupil at a new school .
on that occasion he arrived in the head teacher 's office fearing an early appointment with her slipper and was told to remove his coat and wait for 10 minutes .
in his trepidation the mp misheard her , thinking that she said ' remove your clothes ' .
admitting exposure " to this day i recall with horror the look on both our faces -lsb- when she returned -rsb- , " he said .
mr lammy said that his mother had recently shown him an old school report .
it read : " your son is a model pupil - unfortunately he is not a working one . "
but despite the difficulties , education had been his gateway to success , he said .
mr lammy also used the opportunity of his speech to raise the issue of multiculturalism .
as one of only a handful of ethnic minority mps , he said he looked forward to the day when he no longer stood out in the commons .
he said : " i look forward to the day when women and black people will not stand out on these benches and this house will truly be a house of representatives . "
he believed that the house of commons and a labour government were the way forward to build a cohesive society - even if parliament did sometimes seem out of step with the rest of the country .
slow train to illustrate the point he told an anecdote recounted to him by a woman at a recent constituency surgery who described being on a very slow train in her native jamaica .
an irate american tourist stormed up the carriage and asked the driver if he could go any faster .
" i can go faster but i 've got to stay with the train , " said the driver .
equally the commons was the " only vehicle " for delivering necessary change in the uk , mr lammy said .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- are stock options on the way back ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo thursday , 21 june , 2001 , 06:32 gmt 07:32 uk are stock options on the way back ?
what good are stock options when share prices are falling ?
by bbc news online 's orla ryan what does it take to persuade a dot.com worker to get out of bed these days ?
whatever it is , it will not be the stock options that they have stuffed in their mattresses .
they probably provide more comfort at night than they do during the working day .
dot.com workers have seen their paper fortunes crash with their companies ' share prices in the past year .
last year , these options became one of the most popular ways to get and keep staff at technology and telecoms companies .
now , without these options , these companies are finding it difficult to hold on to key staff .
and telecoms company marconi argues that the way forward is to re-price employee stock options - giving employees a second chance to make their fortune .
other uk companies may follow their lead , in line with their us counterparts .
so much of the share price depends on things outside of employee control , such as sectoral changes , global markets city consultant there is however one snag .
surely - so the argument goes - the whole point of these kind of incentives is they do not pay out when companies perform badly ?
staff leaving telecoms and technology companies are among those hardest hit by fears of slowdown in the us , with business news flow in recent months dominated by profit warnings in these sectors .
however , the slowdown has yet to hit the jobs market and these same companies are still finding it difficult to get the specialist staff they need .
the new economy tradition was to woo employees with stock options .
in marconi 's case , some employees received 1,000 free options to vest at £ 16.03 .
given that the share price now hovers at about £ 2.68 , with little sign of near-term recovery , it is clear that these options provide little incentive to stay .
under the new plan , nearly 40,000 employees around the world would receive 500 shares at an exercise price of £ 8 .
arguably , there is n't much chance of the shares tripling in value to reach this level either .
but at least it is not complete utopia .
uk invasion this kind of re-pricing is very unusual in the uk .
typically , fears exist of stock dilution , though the structure of the marconi offer makes this less of an issue .
falling us markets have encouraged some employers to re-price their options however , marconi 's share price fell on the news .
convincing shareholders to back the proposal at an agm on 18 july will be tough .
marconi chief executive george simpson said the decision was a " a big ask for our shareholders and we will have to work hard to get this through .
there is some apprehension . "
" obviously , there are concerns about setting a precedent .
but the alternative is doing nothing , which would tear the guts out of our business .
i would be in dereliction of my duty to do nothing , " he was quoted in the financial times .
shareholder fears marconi hopes to win the confidence of the association of british insurers .
insurance companies own an estimated one fifth of the equity of uk companies and the abi provides them with information to guide their voting decisions .
however , an abi spokeswoman said : " in principal , we do n't like re-pricing , it breaks the link between performance and remuneration , which is one of the principal links of corporate governance . "
the problem for shareholders generally , says marcus peaker at executive pay consultancy meis , is that they are rewarding employees for failure .
" there is a feeling that if you do a deal , the terms of the deal have been changed half way through it , " peaker said .
others point out that a lower share price can not necessarily be attributed to employee actions .
" so much of the share price depends on things outside of employee control , such as sectoral changes , global markets , " one consultant argued .
us leads more companies in the uk are likely to face increasing pressure to follow marconi 's lead .
each case will be viewed on an individual basis , the abi spokeswoman said , though she does not necessarily anticipate a flood of stock option re-pricing .
it is uncertain what the reaction from shareholders will be .
by contrast , in the us and canada , stock options re-pricing has become widespread in the past year and occurs almost without comment .
marconi 's canadian rival nortel networks re-priced options last week .
" this is an extraordinary step that is essential so we may continue to attract , retain and reward our talent in a highly competitive labour market , " john roth , president and chief executive officer of nortel networks .
cisco chief executive john chambers also said it was necessary to re-price the company 's stock options to encourage workers to stay .
ultimately , it is the departure of staff , which could hurt the company more in the longer term than any dilution of stock , they argue .
" that is where we believe the interest of the shareholders are at risk .
if company does not take right action , we will lose the talent you need and that will affect shareholders , " a marconi spokesman said .

the film will be shown to an audience of about 30,000 inside the tokyo dome , japan 's largest indoor stadium .
the film 's director -lrb- l -rrb- and one of its stars greet press in tokyo but not all the action will be in the movie .
right-wing gangs in black trucks are expected to parade outside the stadium , haranguing the film-makers and distributors through loudspeakers .
they always protest against any film that highlights japan 's aggression during the second world war .
' sensitive ' in fact , the makers of pearl harbor have bent over backwards to be sensitive to japanese concerns .
the film explores the reasons for japan 's pre-emptive attack in a sympathetic way .
many young japanese do n't realise what happened at pearl harbor parts of the script have been changed for the japanese version of the film and it is being marketed here as a love story , not a war movie .
the sensitivity is necessary because japanese audiences provide around a quarter of the revenue of a typical hollywood blockbuster , and given pearl harbor 's lukewarm reception in the united states , distributor buena vista international is counting on japanese sales to boost profits .
the target audience is mainly young people , many of whom will be learning about pearl harbor for the first time .
details of world war ii are glossed over in school textbooks , and few japanese films are prepared to tackle such a controversial subject .
as a result , many young japanese do not even realise there was an attack on pearl harbor in 1941 .

investors can purchase shares - to be priced within the 24 to 27.5 euros range - from thursday .
at the mid-point of this range the float will raise 780m euros , with the whole exchange valued at 3.1bn euros -lrb- £ 1.9bn , $ 2.65bn -rrb- .
euronext , formed in september by the merger of the leading exchanges in paris , brussels and amsterdam , is aiming to become the dominant exchange in europe .
it is soon to join forces with the lisbon stock exchange .
the capital raised will be used to raise the exchange 's visibility within europe and to pursue a policy of acquisitions .
bucking the trend the decision to float marks a growing trend amongst exchanges to first demutualise and then offer shares to the public .
an early flotation bucks the trend , with many other companies already having chosen to postpone rather float in the currently falling stock markets .
stock market declines are bad for the exchanges themselves , as investors shy away from investments , causing trading volumes - and fees - to drop .
shares will be on sale until 4 july , with the float price set on 5 july and trading beginning on 6 july .
the offering will be a combination of new equity and stock being sold by the financial institutions that now own the exchange .
the main listing will be in paris , but shares will also be traded domestically in amsterdam and brussels .
success of peers euronext may have been encouraged to push ahead by the successful float of its rival deutsche börse in february this year .
shares in frankfurt 's leading exchange were more than 25 times oversubscribed .
they surged 11 % on their first day of trading and are still well above the flotation price .
oslo boers holding of norway floated in may , while the london stock exchange is reportedly pushing ahead with a flotation this summer .
the us technology market , nasdaq , is also mulling a listing , and set up a committee to examine this strategy earlier this year , with a decision expected late this year .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- is bigger better for the eu ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo thursday , 21 june , 2001 , 07:47 gmt 08:47 uk is bigger better for the eu ?
as the european union summit gets under way in gothenburg , one word is on everyone 's mind : expansion .
sweden , the summit host , was hoping that this week 's meeting would set a clear timetable for expansion of the eu to include up to 12 new member states .
the nice treaty , agreed last year , had paved the way for that .
but the irish people threw a spanner in the works when they rejected the treaty in a referendum on 7 june .
now the eu has to decide what to do about the irish no vote , while prospective members wait anxiously for a decision .
but is bigger better for the eu ?
should it press ahead with expansion ?
or was the irish vote a call to rethink that strategy ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the eu treatment of the irish vote has confirmed to all their definition of democracy .
their un-elected officials decide upon a policy and put it to the vote .
if the vote is in their favour , then the policy is introduced .
if the vote is not in their favour , then they introduce the policy anyway .
long live democracy !
john gant , uk they have developed and become valuable markets for our exports simon , belgium -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i am astonished at those british contributors to this debate who complain about the cost of subsidising eastern european countries through eu expansion .
do n't they realise that this cost is far lower than the cost of wars , instability and refugees ?
i 'd rather spend my money helping eastern europe become an economic success , than on sending in our army to deal with yet another bosnia or kosovo .
and have these critics taken a look at spain , portugal , greece and ireland ?
all of these countries were economic basket-cases before they joined the eu .
and , yes , the uk helped " subsidise " them .
but now , they have developed and become valuable markets for our exports .
simon , belgium -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- eu expansion is good .
the greater the number of cooks , the more likely the broth will be spoiled .
more members would make it more difficult to gain consensus .
without consensus , the eu might be left as the free trade community we joined thirty years ago without being able to continually infringe upon our rights and sovereignty .
charles macdonald , uk what is this eu to become ?
some of you just want to be bigger to poke your finger into uncle sam 's eye .
i think this dream will come to a halt when the germans realize how much money they are spending to help france realize its goal of ruling europe !
eddie , houston , texas i do n't necessarily think that expansion of the eu is a bad thing in itself if it were purely an issue of breaking down trade barriers .
however , i hope these new member states are going into this with their eyes wide open with regard to their loss of sovereignty in a few years time .
do n't believe what the politicians tell you - a " united states of europe " is inevitable and the men in grey suits will simply not let referendums or protests -lrb- short of a war -rrb- stand in their way .
i hope i 'm wrong but i fear that a federal europe is a recipe for a huge -lrb- what will be by then ' civil ' -rrb- war somewhere down the line that will make bosnia look like a playground scrap .
too many diverse ingredients thrown into the pot will not necessarily make a pleasant tasting soup !
clive , australia -lrb- ex uk -rrb- people on this board from the uk seem to be very right wing ; you do n't seem to like change .
first you want to keep the pound , have no greater involvement in the eu , and now you say you do n't want to enlarge the eu .
labour is in power in the uk , it took 18 years for british people to accept change , i hope it wo n't take another 18 years before the people of the uk realised what is right and support european policies instead of calling them undemocratic .
look at the long term ; eastern europe is the key to europe in the " long term " .
jack homes , european union i have travelled the world in trade fairs and as a company we always said " where there is trade , there is peace " .
where there is trade there is commerce and wealth -lrb- mark dickinson take note -rrb- , but where there is none of this there is envy , greed , corruption and poverty for the majority .
as much as i dislike and criticise both the eu in its structure and rules and regulations , i would say that we have all never had it so good , both in terms of economics and peace , and we should make sure that this is extended to those countries that wish to join us in this spirit .
there will always be an element of " us but not them " .
this morning there was a bus and subway strike in cologne because the buses are likely to be privatised and companies from foreign countries have put in bids which are cheaper than domestic ones !
you ca n't have your cake and eat it !
we are in the eu and those are the rules and the wealth generated is for the good of all , not just a chosen few .
yvonne kirchgaesser , uk / germany let 's try to avoid the polarisation of people into the " yes get bigger " and the " put the barriers up " sides .
no doubt there is much scope for eu enlargement but things should slow down until the existing institutions , systems and practical issues of eu membership are fully understood by the people of states that are already a part of it .
perhaps the irish vote was a shot across the bows of politicians because there is a fear that we do n't understand what we have now never mind further expansion .
dave lynch , england is it any wonder some people feel so frustrated tom bacon , uk i am infuriated by the whole expansionist cause .
not long ago i would n't have minded either way , but the way the eu have ridden roughshod over the democratic decisions made by the irish referendum has been the final straw .
we are supposed to live in a democracy , yet the eu seems to believe it can ignore the vote of the people and , in essence , tell them to " change their minds " .
is it any wonder some people feel so frustrated that they believe violence to be the only thing that gets any attention paid to them ?
tom bacon , uk can anyone blame the protesters when the veiws of the people are being ignored .
tony blair talks about democracy but only if it agrees with his ideas , otherwise it is rubbished by him and his kind .
mike watson , england claims that an expanded eu will " prevent another yugoslavia " -lrb- george , uk -rrb- , yugoslavia is exactly what the eu is becoming - an artificial , oversized and undemocratic federation .
neil , uk yes , expansion is good for europe , but we need more political integration before we expand further .
this is especially true for currency union .
michael zellhorn , uk i agree entirely with di from the usa .
in the states as well as a central federal tax each state has its own levels of income tax , sales tax and the like .
if you do n't like your state you go to another one .
the people are different and the culture may be slightly different but the language is the same .
if you ca n't find work in california but you can in new york , you pack up and move .
if you ca n't find work in ireland and move to hungary for a job the cultural differences are huge , and the language is totally different .
the model of the us simply wo n't work here .
karl peters , uk i have spent some time in the countries of central and eastern europe and i 've found it hard to accept the sense of hopelessness that dominates the spirit of the young there .
these people share the same values as we do .
they did n't ask to be imprisoned under a communist system following the war .
they did n't ask to have their rivers and cities polluted .
the did n't ask to have their infrastructures neglected , they did n't ask for poverty or corruption or poor health - but that 's what they got and now we all have a moral obligation to pitch in and give them a hand .
we must make the process transparent and we must make them accountable for our investment .
the people of eastern europe have suffered long enough .
wayne , eu the politicians seek expansion as it increases their power .
to force so many individual countries into an unwieldy super-state is a recipe for revolution and an open door to dictatorship .
wendy , uk mr blair 's declaration that the anarchists ' protests will not stand in the way of democracy is duplicitous and hypocritical .
the pro-europeans faction claim that the low turn-out for the irish referendum on the nice treaty effectively invalidates its result .
in fact the turn-out for the referendum was higher than that for many of the european elections .
the european political elite should listen to their people 's voice and declare the nice treaty non-ratified and hence null and void .
to bury their head in the sand by ignoring the non-ratification of the treaty and effectively calling for a repeat of the irish referendum until a " yes " vote is obtained is not only undemocratic and imperialistic in the extreme .
moreover it is a recipe for a disaster .
european federalists , ignore your people 's voice at your peril edwin thornber , britain congratulations to the irish who stopped this appalling treaty .
the eu is a threat to national sovereignty of any nation and the states hoping to join are sleepwalking to their own destruction .
the fact that we are even members of the eu is a betrayal of all who died in two world wars to keep the uk independent .
al , uk eastern europe will become a money pit for subsidies gary , england george -lrb- uk -rrb- seems to miss the point .
there may be 200 million in the east wanting to be in , but the 3.5m in ireland who voted against expansion are already members and voted not to expand .
their voices must be heard by the euro politicians .
why should we subsidise the eastern block when we need all our taxes to pay for our health service schools etc. or are these people more important then our children 's education or pensioners .
eastern europe will become a money pit for subsidies and our taxes as well as put many of us out of work as companies go to the cheap labour of the east .
gary , england we are already net contributors to the eu .
with more under-developed countries being admitted this situation will worsen .
with the british transport , health and education services hanging on a knife-edge in the uk anything that draws funds away from these essential services is unjustifiable .
pete , england as a person who voted no to nice , i did so for one reason only .
nice was primarily about the voting arrangements after enlargement .
it was this and it is this alone which the irish people will reject until it is corrected .
we want an eu of thriving , democratic , equals .
not this compromise called nice which only favours the larger countries .
austin rock , ireland i have always thought that the only way to topple americanisation is to counter-act it with europeisation .
honestly speaking , i resent my culture being overwhelmed by burger and pizza chains .
just as france has taken a stand against this by promoting its own culture , so too should the brits , or better still , so too should europe .
together we can be a strong cultural force .
so i say yes to expansion .
eastern europe has a lot to offer us culturally .
as a language graduate , i would love to see a cyrillic language studied in schools as much as french or german .
are we in britain really so inward thinking that we would deprive ourselves of the opportunity to strengthen our position in the world ?
only by boldly entering europe ourselves and promoting our own culture there can we be strong and proud in a european super state .
matthew baines , london , uk no .
economically net contributors to the eu -lrb- like the uk -rrb- will have to massively increase their contributions to pay for these weaker economies and we will lose our right of veto .
will there be a fair referendum on this , that will actually be listened to -lrb- rather than steamrollered and ignored like in ireland -rrb- ?
i can just imagine the wording now : " do you want to see a larger european union or are you a nazi , baby-eating , 3-headed alien ?
yes / no " .
hmmm , let me think .
john , uk does anyone really think they can make the european union any worse ?
the eu 's biggest area of responsibility - agriculture - is a disgrace and the principles of a true democracy have never been respected : if you vote yes the decision is " irrevocable " if you vote no -lrb- as did denmark and ireland -rrb- you vote again !
david buckley , belgium i welcome a larger europe with open arms .
a larger europe means a more peaceful europe .
what more could any peace-loving human being want .
we in the uk need to wake up and realise we are not part of america , we are part of a wonderfully diverse europe .
darren palmer , uk i rather think that a european superpower will not accurately reflect the wishes of the people and each country 's needs .
here in the us each state makes laws and has taxation power at the state level and we can therefore choose where we live if say , we do n't like the death penalty , high taxes , lack of quality education or quality of life issues .
i would not like to see the cultural and social differences which make each european country unique , thrown aside in order to accommodate the lowest common denominator .
a unified europe is one matter , a europe which does not allow demonstrations and public outcry against policy does a disservice to the people .
di stewart , usa while i was cycling through romania last summer i gained a special insight into life outside the european union .
corruption is rife in every area of life - we even had to bribe guards to allow us to carry our bicycles on a train .
basic things we take for granted are subject to the whims of self-appointed petty criminals .
there is a noticeable lack of civic responsibility or solidarity , the result of the chaos of poverty .
i think we should be doing everything possible to extend the freedoms and prosperity we take for granted inside the eu .
apart from being the decent thing to do , it is also important for our own quality of life as it encourages the stability of countries to the east and ensures continued peace on our continent .
i think it is highly selfish of the irish electorate to try in any way to jeopardise the progress of romania and other countries towards achieving a standard of living and quality of life we think of as our birthright .
it is particularly shocking given the way in which ireland has benefited from eu membership .
bharain mac an bhreithiun , ireland i believe that my country has done the eu a favour fiachra , ireland whether or not you agree with the treaty of nice , i believe that my country has done the eu a favour , in that its vote has stimulated debate on the very complex workings of the union - debate which was very much lacking until now .
it is increasingly looking like the eu is going to morph into a vast , unwieldy bureaucracy that is led by the powerful nations - the original signatories of the treaty of rome , chiefly germany , france , uk , spain and italy .
the smaller -lrb- like ireland -rrb- and the weaker -lrb- like the current applicants -rrb- are going to become disillusioned as their already minimal influence dwindles to nothing .
wake up europe - stop !
take stock and listen to debate before you decide to proceed ...
fiachra , ireland why should the eu be bigger ?
soon we will be back to " the world " .
let 's keep it europe and agree with the irish people .
vannetiere , france we need a skilled counterweight to american unilateralism paul connor , canada in the long run , the union could include everyone from reykjavik to vladivostok .
why not ?
where 's the threat ?
by the way , if it was more about harmonising laws -lrb- equality of opportunity -rrb- than wealth -lrb- equality of result -rrb- , any free-market democracy could join right away .
it 's these useless and destructive subsidies that open the question of new , poorer applicants draining the rest of the union .
settle this , europe !
god knows we need a skilled counterweight to american unilateralism , however well intentioned they are .
paul connor , canada enlargement should definitely proceed .
without this " carrot " the eastern european states would be much less far along the road to stability , democracy and development which is good for us too .
an enlarged eu also gives us a larger market for our goods and , for the eurosceptics , it will also slow down closer integration while the eu focuses on enlargement instead .
the irish vote was not a fear of enlargement and anyway , should 3.5m people in ireland block something that 200m in the east want ?
george , uk i am encouraged by stronger ties among the current and possible future eu nations .
the european voice seems to speak with moderation -lrb- on the whole -rrb- .
the stronger the eu , the more i believe we will have continued relative peace .
further , since the eu already surpasses the us in total population as well as gdp , maybe it will become the default fall-guy for the world 's complaints .
we in the us are a little weary of this default status .
william c. soule ' , texas , usa a lot of work remains to be done both inside the eu and in the applying countries michael engman , sweden there is a clear moral obligation of the eu , and a self-evident right for the non-member european countries , that all countries that wish to join and are ready to fulfil the requirements in the legal , economic and democratic framework are welcome .
a lot of work remains to be done both inside the eu and in the applying countries .
the " in-the-club " citizens should focus more of their attention on how we can make this place a peaceful , stable and prosperous area for all europeans .
michael engman , sweden as long as everyone wants to be included and actively involved , there will always be room for a larger europe .
if there must be a central government , that is ok , as long as it is not in germany .
they have tried several times to control europe , let 's not be blind .
costas , hellenic republic the eu will expand to become the world government .
it will merge with the up and coming north american union and the asian union .
then all countries will have to fall into the ranks or be left behind economically .
this is not an " if " but a " when " .
barry jocelyn , canada europe must be for the people - but not run by them !
alex pinkerton , scotland only when the countries of the east become full members of the european family , can the goal of a truly united and integrated europe become a reality .
this will not only guarantee peace and stability on a continental scale , it will also help to balance the undue power wielded by the united states .
that is why the referendum in ireland should not be viewed as " done and dusted " .
as a dedicated european i agree with the brussels line that , europe must be for the people - but not run by them !
alex pinkerton , scotland firstly , i would like to say that the irish people are not against enlargement they are against the new system of voting in the eu where they would lose their commissioner and the veto .
concerns about the rapid reaction force are there too .
the candidate countries think that they will have the same opportunities that we had when they join the eu , they will not .
when we joined we had more power within the eec as it was then known and we had the veto which we could use if something in a proposed treaty did n't agree with us .
by the time these countries join they will be under this new system where the bigger countries will have more votes than the smaller ones so they will not have a veto .
francis dunne , ireland why are n't the people of the current eu member states given more information about enlargement ?
how will the eu be able to support the extra countries as the farming policy is already a shambles ?
how can it hope to cope with underdeveloped eastern europe countries .
it would cost a fortune to apply the social policy alone - who would foot the bill ?
steve bentley , uk i think it is time for the rest of the world to wake up to the fact that eastern european countries have always been part of european culture - perhaps much more so than anglo-saxon countries -lrb- save for 40 odd years of unpleasant distraction -rrb- and , as such , have a lot more to offer than just being the " poor relatives " .
education , the health service , not to mention young people 's attitudes and behaviour , compare very favourably to the uk , for example .
excluding these countries from the eu is also very shortsighted .
eva w , uk -lrb- from hungary -rrb- we have never had the chance to vote on whether to become part of a super-state stephen phillips , england although i did n't vote for the ukip in the recent elections , i can understand their concerns .
we have never had the chance to vote on whether to become part of a super-state .
the common market we voted to remain in in 1975 has changed beyond recognition .
we should insist that our government gives us the chance to decide how much further - if at all - we should submerge ourselves in a euro-superstate .
stephen phillips , england this may appear as a unification of governments , but remember that at the root of this are the people of europe who aspire to an end of divisions and bloody history .
this is a unification of people for solidarity and the preservation of our culture .
i say bring in the turks , the balkans and our east european cousins , then we can truly call ourselves the european union .
this may need some sacrifice at first , but the rewards in the long term will far exceed anybody 's expectations today !
vrata , france / uk whenever the " little people " get to vote on europe they vote against it .
the danes rejected the euro despite overwhelming media support .
the irish rejected the nice treaty .
support in the uk is less than 50 % , support in germany is dropping rapidly yet the powers that be insist on steamrollering through their plans .
i always thought democracy was about representing the people , not ignoring the vote and trying again claiming people were too stupid to understand the question .
firstly if people are too stupid to understand a simple question they should n't be voting .
secondly , what is the hidden agenda here ?
nobody except the politicians seems to want to enlarge .
john b , uk a no vote means that eu politicians should at least sit up and take note .
except they have so little power to call the council of ministers to account , who seem hell bent on the project no matter what , and so the eu politicians will get overruled .
i am not anti-european as closer integration would appear to produce real benefits for my family and myself .
i just want to keep certain people who claim to speak on my behalf on a shorter leash .
steve dixey , uk it is of great importance that we get as many european nations under the union umbrella as possible .
currently europe is the home of moderate and advanced thinking .
we should do everything in our power to get this culture of reason , peace and global understanding expanded as far as it is naturally possible .
mikko toivonen , finland why does the eu have to be bigger and better than the us ?
c. williams , england why does the eu have to be bigger and better than the us ?
the us has given the world so much in the last century - mostly at the expense of france and germany - that we should be joining with them , not going against them .
c. williams , england the idea of getting larger and larger is something that frightens me .
instead of solving problems and creating welfare and stability , we are going to make problems .
i think we must finish enlargement with poland , hungary , the czech republic , norway and switzerland -lrb- if they want -rrb- and from then on put our energy into each other to solve internal disagreements and set common goals for the future .
all members of the eu , despite their differences , have a common cultural background .
let 's not throw away such unwritten , unspoken understandings !
reinier bosman , the netherlands while i do indeed believe in the eu , i am concerned about the notion that expansion will lead to the loss of national identity .
this may sound odd coming from a german , but i fear that we will lose our currencies -lrb- already lost -rrb- , national identities , and possibly languages all for a united europe .
i am proud to be european , but i am also proud to be a german .
mathias , germany the european elite has waged a propaganda war against its own inhabitants about the benefits of expansion .
the fact of the matter is that some brains have n't been washed .
all of those who find themselves to be immune to the eu plague have no desire to lose the sovereignty of their homelands to the ussr sequel .
ashlon , texas , usa the eu needs to get its house in order before expanding further euan gray , uk firstly , the nice treaty is only peripherally about enlargement .
existing treaties permit the eu to admit a further five countries at any time .
to state that the irish " no " vote prejudices enlargement is untrue .
secondly , the eu needs to get its house in order before expanding further .
the cap , as currently formulated , would bankrupt the eu if the applicant countries were added - things like this need to get resolved first .
euan gray , uk sure that it is better .
with a bigger eu we will have more prosperity and opportunities as well as a more powerful voice .
we can also maintain the most important and difficult thing to obtain - peace .
this is the road for a united europe where every minority is recognised and were everyone has human rights .
the small island of malta is eager to join our ' bigger brother ' and we hope to join the more prosperous present eu countries and also the developing eastern ones - one whole united europe .
mark , malta i note that the rest of the eu people do not get a choice robert , uk the nice treaty was not just about expansion ; it also included areas that irish people were not happy about .
the possible loss of their neutrality due to being forced to co-operate in the rapid reaction force .
if these treaties were concerned with a single area rather than trying to cover a multitude of areas , then perhaps they would be more likely to be agreed if and when the masses get a chance to vote and choose .
i note that the rest of the eu people do not get a choice .
the politicians get the choice .
if these treaties did n't try and sneak things through in the small print there might be more agreement .
robert , uk i travel widely across the ec , and have been noticing that political opinion is leaning further and further to the right with regards to immigrants .
whilst i support the expansion , i do n't know if political stability could cope with accepting these new countries into the ec .
i have n't forgotten what happened in the 30 's and 40 's .
alex banks , uk , living in holland bigger is definitely better for the eu -lrb- how else can we offer a counterbalance to the usa ? -rrb- but not yet .
we need to reform the current institutions to make them more streamlined and accountable before they become too large through expansion , making the necessary changes more difficult .
mark , uk of course we should expand the eu .
it 'll make europe more stable by enforcing common laws to protect minorities and prevent another yugoslavia .
it 'll also give existing eu members a stronger european voice in the world and help bring russia closer too .
our investors gain access to cheap skilled labour and they in turn become consumers for our goods .
it 's a win win situation .
george , uk the irish vote is a message for the eu to slow down the pace for a bigger union namara , canada the irish vote is a message for the eu to slow down the pace for a bigger union .
normally , pacts signed in a hurry have flaws that may impede the progress of the union as originally envisioned .
the " fighting irish " , have their interests at heart that have to be listened to .
their economy is doing well at the moment .
so for now , the rush to unionise the whole europe is on the backburner .
namara , canada i think that all depends on what the aims of expansion are .
if it is to create a super-state which puts wealth and commerce at the top of the agenda in order to create even fatter cats then i would resist expansion .
however , if it is for the good of more people , so that we richer nations can help bring about a more peaceful existence and higher standard of living to poorer nations , then i 'm all for it .
i ca n't help thinking that no votes are really saying , ' we do n't want dragging down by these eastern european poor relatives ' , which is very sad indeed .
mark dickinson , nottingham , england expansion should definitely not go ahead now .
before any enlargement the eu institutions have to be reformed to be more flexible and democratic because otherwise the eu will suffocate in bureaucracy .
i 'm amazed that many british are against more democratic powers for the eu but in favour of expansion .
if you think the eu is inefficient now , how do you expect it to work when 25 countries have to vote unanimously ?
i think it 's time for all of us to come out of the national caves and develop a stronger ' european spirit ' .
if that happens , fine , if not , forget expansion .
it will destroy the union .
carl meyer , uk -lrb- from germany -rrb- this is a unique opportunity for europe to become a united country , let 's do it jean pournaras , greece from the time of the romans the struggle for a greater europe has been going on and on by force .
now most of the europeans want to unite of their own accord and we have people rejecting it ?
this is a unique opportunity for europe to become a united country , let 's do it .
jean pournaras , greece it will be a sad if this union turns into a super government .
what then if some country wants out ?
we in the u.s. know what a huge price there was to pay when that was tried here .
do n't do it .
william bellew , u.s.a. let 's see if i 've got this right .
the eu first decides that all member states " must " agree to the nice treaty before it can be implemented .
then it gives ireland the right to vote on , and so effectively veto , the issue .
yet when the irish people decide to reject the nice treaty the eu goes into headless chicken mode .
is n't this all just a teensy bit incompetent ?
andrew duff , uk yes , it is definitely time for a rethink , and to listen to the opinion of the people for a change , and not just the member governments .
otherwise , the eu runs the risk of getting too big and not being accountable to anyone and ignoring the smaller members .
this is already beginning to happen .
why was ireland the only country to ask their population what they thought ?
why is the eu trying to find ways to enlarge anyway despite that decision ?

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- is bigger better for the eu ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo thursday , 21 june , 2001 , 07:47 gmt 08:47 uk is bigger better for the eu ?
as the european union summit gets under way in gothenburg , one word is on everyone 's mind : expansion .
sweden , the summit host , was hoping that this week 's meeting would set a clear timetable for expansion of the eu to include up to 12 new member states .
the nice treaty , agreed last year , had paved the way for that .
but the irish people threw a spanner in the works when they rejected the treaty in a referendum on 7 june .
now the eu has to decide what to do about the irish no vote , while prospective members wait anxiously for a decision .
but is bigger better for the eu ?
should it press ahead with expansion ?
or was the irish vote a call to rethink that strategy ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the eu treatment of the irish vote has confirmed to all their definition of democracy .
their un-elected officials decide upon a policy and put it to the vote .
if the vote is in their favour , then the policy is introduced .
if the vote is not in their favour , then they introduce the policy anyway .
long live democracy !
john gant , uk they have developed and become valuable markets for our exports simon , belgium -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i am astonished at those british contributors to this debate who complain about the cost of subsidising eastern european countries through eu expansion .
do n't they realise that this cost is far lower than the cost of wars , instability and refugees ?
i 'd rather spend my money helping eastern europe become an economic success , than on sending in our army to deal with yet another bosnia or kosovo .
and have these critics taken a look at spain , portugal , greece and ireland ?
all of these countries were economic basket-cases before they joined the eu .
and , yes , the uk helped " subsidise " them .
but now , they have developed and become valuable markets for our exports .
simon , belgium -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- eu expansion is good .
the greater the number of cooks , the more likely the broth will be spoiled .
more members would make it more difficult to gain consensus .
without consensus , the eu might be left as the free trade community we joined thirty years ago without being able to continually infringe upon our rights and sovereignty .
charles macdonald , uk what is this eu to become ?
some of you just want to be bigger to poke your finger into uncle sam 's eye .
i think this dream will come to a halt when the germans realize how much money they are spending to help france realize its goal of ruling europe !
eddie , houston , texas i do n't necessarily think that expansion of the eu is a bad thing in itself if it were purely an issue of breaking down trade barriers .
however , i hope these new member states are going into this with their eyes wide open with regard to their loss of sovereignty in a few years time .
do n't believe what the politicians tell you - a " united states of europe " is inevitable and the men in grey suits will simply not let referendums or protests -lrb- short of a war -rrb- stand in their way .
i hope i 'm wrong but i fear that a federal europe is a recipe for a huge -lrb- what will be by then ' civil ' -rrb- war somewhere down the line that will make bosnia look like a playground scrap .
too many diverse ingredients thrown into the pot will not necessarily make a pleasant tasting soup !
clive , australia -lrb- ex uk -rrb- people on this board from the uk seem to be very right wing ; you do n't seem to like change .
first you want to keep the pound , have no greater involvement in the eu , and now you say you do n't want to enlarge the eu .
labour is in power in the uk , it took 18 years for british people to accept change , i hope it wo n't take another 18 years before the people of the uk realised what is right and support european policies instead of calling them undemocratic .
look at the long term ; eastern europe is the key to europe in the " long term " .
jack homes , european union i have travelled the world in trade fairs and as a company we always said " where there is trade , there is peace " .
where there is trade there is commerce and wealth -lrb- mark dickinson take note -rrb- , but where there is none of this there is envy , greed , corruption and poverty for the majority .
as much as i dislike and criticise both the eu in its structure and rules and regulations , i would say that we have all never had it so good , both in terms of economics and peace , and we should make sure that this is extended to those countries that wish to join us in this spirit .
there will always be an element of " us but not them " .
this morning there was a bus and subway strike in cologne because the buses are likely to be privatised and companies from foreign countries have put in bids which are cheaper than domestic ones !
you ca n't have your cake and eat it !
we are in the eu and those are the rules and the wealth generated is for the good of all , not just a chosen few .
yvonne kirchgaesser , uk / germany let 's try to avoid the polarisation of people into the " yes get bigger " and the " put the barriers up " sides .
no doubt there is much scope for eu enlargement but things should slow down until the existing institutions , systems and practical issues of eu membership are fully understood by the people of states that are already a part of it .
perhaps the irish vote was a shot across the bows of politicians because there is a fear that we do n't understand what we have now never mind further expansion .
dave lynch , england is it any wonder some people feel so frustrated tom bacon , uk i am infuriated by the whole expansionist cause .
not long ago i would n't have minded either way , but the way the eu have ridden roughshod over the democratic decisions made by the irish referendum has been the final straw .
we are supposed to live in a democracy , yet the eu seems to believe it can ignore the vote of the people and , in essence , tell them to " change their minds " .
is it any wonder some people feel so frustrated that they believe violence to be the only thing that gets any attention paid to them ?
tom bacon , uk can anyone blame the protesters when the veiws of the people are being ignored .
tony blair talks about democracy but only if it agrees with his ideas , otherwise it is rubbished by him and his kind .
mike watson , england claims that an expanded eu will " prevent another yugoslavia " -lrb- george , uk -rrb- , yugoslavia is exactly what the eu is becoming - an artificial , oversized and undemocratic federation .
neil , uk yes , expansion is good for europe , but we need more political integration before we expand further .
this is especially true for currency union .
michael zellhorn , uk i agree entirely with di from the usa .
in the states as well as a central federal tax each state has its own levels of income tax , sales tax and the like .
if you do n't like your state you go to another one .
the people are different and the culture may be slightly different but the language is the same .
if you ca n't find work in california but you can in new york , you pack up and move .
if you ca n't find work in ireland and move to hungary for a job the cultural differences are huge , and the language is totally different .
the model of the us simply wo n't work here .
karl peters , uk i have spent some time in the countries of central and eastern europe and i 've found it hard to accept the sense of hopelessness that dominates the spirit of the young there .
these people share the same values as we do .
they did n't ask to be imprisoned under a communist system following the war .
they did n't ask to have their rivers and cities polluted .
the did n't ask to have their infrastructures neglected , they did n't ask for poverty or corruption or poor health - but that 's what they got and now we all have a moral obligation to pitch in and give them a hand .
we must make the process transparent and we must make them accountable for our investment .
the people of eastern europe have suffered long enough .
wayne , eu the politicians seek expansion as it increases their power .
to force so many individual countries into an unwieldy super-state is a recipe for revolution and an open door to dictatorship .
wendy , uk mr blair 's declaration that the anarchists ' protests will not stand in the way of democracy is duplicitous and hypocritical .
the pro-europeans faction claim that the low turn-out for the irish referendum on the nice treaty effectively invalidates its result .
in fact the turn-out for the referendum was higher than that for many of the european elections .
the european political elite should listen to their people 's voice and declare the nice treaty non-ratified and hence null and void .
to bury their head in the sand by ignoring the non-ratification of the treaty and effectively calling for a repeat of the irish referendum until a " yes " vote is obtained is not only undemocratic and imperialistic in the extreme .
moreover it is a recipe for a disaster .
european federalists , ignore your people 's voice at your peril edwin thornber , britain congratulations to the irish who stopped this appalling treaty .
the eu is a threat to national sovereignty of any nation and the states hoping to join are sleepwalking to their own destruction .
the fact that we are even members of the eu is a betrayal of all who died in two world wars to keep the uk independent .
al , uk eastern europe will become a money pit for subsidies gary , england george -lrb- uk -rrb- seems to miss the point .
there may be 200 million in the east wanting to be in , but the 3.5m in ireland who voted against expansion are already members and voted not to expand .
their voices must be heard by the euro politicians .
why should we subsidise the eastern block when we need all our taxes to pay for our health service schools etc. or are these people more important then our children 's education or pensioners .
eastern europe will become a money pit for subsidies and our taxes as well as put many of us out of work as companies go to the cheap labour of the east .
gary , england we are already net contributors to the eu .
with more under-developed countries being admitted this situation will worsen .
with the british transport , health and education services hanging on a knife-edge in the uk anything that draws funds away from these essential services is unjustifiable .
pete , england as a person who voted no to nice , i did so for one reason only .
nice was primarily about the voting arrangements after enlargement .
it was this and it is this alone which the irish people will reject until it is corrected .
we want an eu of thriving , democratic , equals .
not this compromise called nice which only favours the larger countries .
austin rock , ireland i have always thought that the only way to topple americanisation is to counter-act it with europeisation .
honestly speaking , i resent my culture being overwhelmed by burger and pizza chains .
just as france has taken a stand against this by promoting its own culture , so too should the brits , or better still , so too should europe .
together we can be a strong cultural force .
so i say yes to expansion .
eastern europe has a lot to offer us culturally .
as a language graduate , i would love to see a cyrillic language studied in schools as much as french or german .
are we in britain really so inward thinking that we would deprive ourselves of the opportunity to strengthen our position in the world ?
only by boldly entering europe ourselves and promoting our own culture there can we be strong and proud in a european super state .
matthew baines , london , uk no .
economically net contributors to the eu -lrb- like the uk -rrb- will have to massively increase their contributions to pay for these weaker economies and we will lose our right of veto .
will there be a fair referendum on this , that will actually be listened to -lrb- rather than steamrollered and ignored like in ireland -rrb- ?
i can just imagine the wording now : " do you want to see a larger european union or are you a nazi , baby-eating , 3-headed alien ?
yes / no " .
hmmm , let me think .
john , uk does anyone really think they can make the european union any worse ?
the eu 's biggest area of responsibility - agriculture - is a disgrace and the principles of a true democracy have never been respected : if you vote yes the decision is " irrevocable " if you vote no -lrb- as did denmark and ireland -rrb- you vote again !
david buckley , belgium i welcome a larger europe with open arms .
a larger europe means a more peaceful europe .
what more could any peace-loving human being want .
we in the uk need to wake up and realise we are not part of america , we are part of a wonderfully diverse europe .
darren palmer , uk i rather think that a european superpower will not accurately reflect the wishes of the people and each country 's needs .
here in the us each state makes laws and has taxation power at the state level and we can therefore choose where we live if say , we do n't like the death penalty , high taxes , lack of quality education or quality of life issues .
i would not like to see the cultural and social differences which make each european country unique , thrown aside in order to accommodate the lowest common denominator .
a unified europe is one matter , a europe which does not allow demonstrations and public outcry against policy does a disservice to the people .
di stewart , usa while i was cycling through romania last summer i gained a special insight into life outside the european union .
corruption is rife in every area of life - we even had to bribe guards to allow us to carry our bicycles on a train .
basic things we take for granted are subject to the whims of self-appointed petty criminals .
there is a noticeable lack of civic responsibility or solidarity , the result of the chaos of poverty .
i think we should be doing everything possible to extend the freedoms and prosperity we take for granted inside the eu .
apart from being the decent thing to do , it is also important for our own quality of life as it encourages the stability of countries to the east and ensures continued peace on our continent .
i think it is highly selfish of the irish electorate to try in any way to jeopardise the progress of romania and other countries towards achieving a standard of living and quality of life we think of as our birthright .
it is particularly shocking given the way in which ireland has benefited from eu membership .
bharain mac an bhreithiun , ireland i believe that my country has done the eu a favour fiachra , ireland whether or not you agree with the treaty of nice , i believe that my country has done the eu a favour , in that its vote has stimulated debate on the very complex workings of the union - debate which was very much lacking until now .
it is increasingly looking like the eu is going to morph into a vast , unwieldy bureaucracy that is led by the powerful nations - the original signatories of the treaty of rome , chiefly germany , france , uk , spain and italy .
the smaller -lrb- like ireland -rrb- and the weaker -lrb- like the current applicants -rrb- are going to become disillusioned as their already minimal influence dwindles to nothing .
wake up europe - stop !
take stock and listen to debate before you decide to proceed ...
fiachra , ireland why should the eu be bigger ?
soon we will be back to " the world " .
let 's keep it europe and agree with the irish people .
vannetiere , france we need a skilled counterweight to american unilateralism paul connor , canada in the long run , the union could include everyone from reykjavik to vladivostok .
why not ?
where 's the threat ?
by the way , if it was more about harmonising laws -lrb- equality of opportunity -rrb- than wealth -lrb- equality of result -rrb- , any free-market democracy could join right away .
it 's these useless and destructive subsidies that open the question of new , poorer applicants draining the rest of the union .
settle this , europe !
god knows we need a skilled counterweight to american unilateralism , however well intentioned they are .
paul connor , canada enlargement should definitely proceed .
without this " carrot " the eastern european states would be much less far along the road to stability , democracy and development which is good for us too .
an enlarged eu also gives us a larger market for our goods and , for the eurosceptics , it will also slow down closer integration while the eu focuses on enlargement instead .
the irish vote was not a fear of enlargement and anyway , should 3.5m people in ireland block something that 200m in the east want ?
george , uk i am encouraged by stronger ties among the current and possible future eu nations .
the european voice seems to speak with moderation -lrb- on the whole -rrb- .
the stronger the eu , the more i believe we will have continued relative peace .
further , since the eu already surpasses the us in total population as well as gdp , maybe it will become the default fall-guy for the world 's complaints .
we in the us are a little weary of this default status .
william c. soule ' , texas , usa a lot of work remains to be done both inside the eu and in the applying countries michael engman , sweden there is a clear moral obligation of the eu , and a self-evident right for the non-member european countries , that all countries that wish to join and are ready to fulfil the requirements in the legal , economic and democratic framework are welcome .
a lot of work remains to be done both inside the eu and in the applying countries .
the " in-the-club " citizens should focus more of their attention on how we can make this place a peaceful , stable and prosperous area for all europeans .
michael engman , sweden as long as everyone wants to be included and actively involved , there will always be room for a larger europe .
if there must be a central government , that is ok , as long as it is not in germany .
they have tried several times to control europe , let 's not be blind .
costas , hellenic republic the eu will expand to become the world government .
it will merge with the up and coming north american union and the asian union .
then all countries will have to fall into the ranks or be left behind economically .
this is not an " if " but a " when " .
barry jocelyn , canada europe must be for the people - but not run by them !
alex pinkerton , scotland only when the countries of the east become full members of the european family , can the goal of a truly united and integrated europe become a reality .
this will not only guarantee peace and stability on a continental scale , it will also help to balance the undue power wielded by the united states .
that is why the referendum in ireland should not be viewed as " done and dusted " .
as a dedicated european i agree with the brussels line that , europe must be for the people - but not run by them !
alex pinkerton , scotland firstly , i would like to say that the irish people are not against enlargement they are against the new system of voting in the eu where they would lose their commissioner and the veto .
concerns about the rapid reaction force are there too .
the candidate countries think that they will have the same opportunities that we had when they join the eu , they will not .
when we joined we had more power within the eec as it was then known and we had the veto which we could use if something in a proposed treaty did n't agree with us .
by the time these countries join they will be under this new system where the bigger countries will have more votes than the smaller ones so they will not have a veto .
francis dunne , ireland why are n't the people of the current eu member states given more information about enlargement ?
how will the eu be able to support the extra countries as the farming policy is already a shambles ?
how can it hope to cope with underdeveloped eastern europe countries .
it would cost a fortune to apply the social policy alone - who would foot the bill ?
steve bentley , uk i think it is time for the rest of the world to wake up to the fact that eastern european countries have always been part of european culture - perhaps much more so than anglo-saxon countries -lrb- save for 40 odd years of unpleasant distraction -rrb- and , as such , have a lot more to offer than just being the " poor relatives " .
education , the health service , not to mention young people 's attitudes and behaviour , compare very favourably to the uk , for example .
excluding these countries from the eu is also very shortsighted .
eva w , uk -lrb- from hungary -rrb- we have never had the chance to vote on whether to become part of a super-state stephen phillips , england although i did n't vote for the ukip in the recent elections , i can understand their concerns .
we have never had the chance to vote on whether to become part of a super-state .
the common market we voted to remain in in 1975 has changed beyond recognition .
we should insist that our government gives us the chance to decide how much further - if at all - we should submerge ourselves in a euro-superstate .
stephen phillips , england this may appear as a unification of governments , but remember that at the root of this are the people of europe who aspire to an end of divisions and bloody history .
this is a unification of people for solidarity and the preservation of our culture .
i say bring in the turks , the balkans and our east european cousins , then we can truly call ourselves the european union .
this may need some sacrifice at first , but the rewards in the long term will far exceed anybody 's expectations today !
vrata , france / uk whenever the " little people " get to vote on europe they vote against it .
the danes rejected the euro despite overwhelming media support .
the irish rejected the nice treaty .
support in the uk is less than 50 % , support in germany is dropping rapidly yet the powers that be insist on steamrollering through their plans .
i always thought democracy was about representing the people , not ignoring the vote and trying again claiming people were too stupid to understand the question .
firstly if people are too stupid to understand a simple question they should n't be voting .
secondly , what is the hidden agenda here ?
nobody except the politicians seems to want to enlarge .
john b , uk a no vote means that eu politicians should at least sit up and take note .
except they have so little power to call the council of ministers to account , who seem hell bent on the project no matter what , and so the eu politicians will get overruled .
i am not anti-european as closer integration would appear to produce real benefits for my family and myself .
i just want to keep certain people who claim to speak on my behalf on a shorter leash .
steve dixey , uk it is of great importance that we get as many european nations under the union umbrella as possible .
currently europe is the home of moderate and advanced thinking .
we should do everything in our power to get this culture of reason , peace and global understanding expanded as far as it is naturally possible .
mikko toivonen , finland why does the eu have to be bigger and better than the us ?
c. williams , england why does the eu have to be bigger and better than the us ?
the us has given the world so much in the last century - mostly at the expense of france and germany - that we should be joining with them , not going against them .
c. williams , england the idea of getting larger and larger is something that frightens me .
instead of solving problems and creating welfare and stability , we are going to make problems .
i think we must finish enlargement with poland , hungary , the czech republic , norway and switzerland -lrb- if they want -rrb- and from then on put our energy into each other to solve internal disagreements and set common goals for the future .
all members of the eu , despite their differences , have a common cultural background .
let 's not throw away such unwritten , unspoken understandings !
reinier bosman , the netherlands while i do indeed believe in the eu , i am concerned about the notion that expansion will lead to the loss of national identity .
this may sound odd coming from a german , but i fear that we will lose our currencies -lrb- already lost -rrb- , national identities , and possibly languages all for a united europe .
i am proud to be european , but i am also proud to be a german .
mathias , germany the european elite has waged a propaganda war against its own inhabitants about the benefits of expansion .
the fact of the matter is that some brains have n't been washed .
all of those who find themselves to be immune to the eu plague have no desire to lose the sovereignty of their homelands to the ussr sequel .
ashlon , texas , usa the eu needs to get its house in order before expanding further euan gray , uk firstly , the nice treaty is only peripherally about enlargement .
existing treaties permit the eu to admit a further five countries at any time .
to state that the irish " no " vote prejudices enlargement is untrue .
secondly , the eu needs to get its house in order before expanding further .
the cap , as currently formulated , would bankrupt the eu if the applicant countries were added - things like this need to get resolved first .
euan gray , uk sure that it is better .
with a bigger eu we will have more prosperity and opportunities as well as a more powerful voice .
we can also maintain the most important and difficult thing to obtain - peace .
this is the road for a united europe where every minority is recognised and were everyone has human rights .
the small island of malta is eager to join our ' bigger brother ' and we hope to join the more prosperous present eu countries and also the developing eastern ones - one whole united europe .
mark , malta i note that the rest of the eu people do not get a choice robert , uk the nice treaty was not just about expansion ; it also included areas that irish people were not happy about .
the possible loss of their neutrality due to being forced to co-operate in the rapid reaction force .
if these treaties were concerned with a single area rather than trying to cover a multitude of areas , then perhaps they would be more likely to be agreed if and when the masses get a chance to vote and choose .
i note that the rest of the eu people do not get a choice .
the politicians get the choice .
if these treaties did n't try and sneak things through in the small print there might be more agreement .
robert , uk i travel widely across the ec , and have been noticing that political opinion is leaning further and further to the right with regards to immigrants .
whilst i support the expansion , i do n't know if political stability could cope with accepting these new countries into the ec .
i have n't forgotten what happened in the 30 's and 40 's .
alex banks , uk , living in holland bigger is definitely better for the eu -lrb- how else can we offer a counterbalance to the usa ? -rrb- but not yet .
we need to reform the current institutions to make them more streamlined and accountable before they become too large through expansion , making the necessary changes more difficult .
mark , uk of course we should expand the eu .
it 'll make europe more stable by enforcing common laws to protect minorities and prevent another yugoslavia .
it 'll also give existing eu members a stronger european voice in the world and help bring russia closer too .
our investors gain access to cheap skilled labour and they in turn become consumers for our goods .
it 's a win win situation .
george , uk the irish vote is a message for the eu to slow down the pace for a bigger union namara , canada the irish vote is a message for the eu to slow down the pace for a bigger union .
normally , pacts signed in a hurry have flaws that may impede the progress of the union as originally envisioned .
the " fighting irish " , have their interests at heart that have to be listened to .
their economy is doing well at the moment .
so for now , the rush to unionise the whole europe is on the backburner .
namara , canada i think that all depends on what the aims of expansion are .
if it is to create a super-state which puts wealth and commerce at the top of the agenda in order to create even fatter cats then i would resist expansion .
however , if it is for the good of more people , so that we richer nations can help bring about a more peaceful existence and higher standard of living to poorer nations , then i 'm all for it .
i ca n't help thinking that no votes are really saying , ' we do n't want dragging down by these eastern european poor relatives ' , which is very sad indeed .
mark dickinson , nottingham , england expansion should definitely not go ahead now .
before any enlargement the eu institutions have to be reformed to be more flexible and democratic because otherwise the eu will suffocate in bureaucracy .
i 'm amazed that many british are against more democratic powers for the eu but in favour of expansion .
if you think the eu is inefficient now , how do you expect it to work when 25 countries have to vote unanimously ?
i think it 's time for all of us to come out of the national caves and develop a stronger ' european spirit ' .
if that happens , fine , if not , forget expansion .
it will destroy the union .
carl meyer , uk -lrb- from germany -rrb- this is a unique opportunity for europe to become a united country , let 's do it jean pournaras , greece from the time of the romans the struggle for a greater europe has been going on and on by force .
now most of the europeans want to unite of their own accord and we have people rejecting it ?
this is a unique opportunity for europe to become a united country , let 's do it .
jean pournaras , greece it will be a sad if this union turns into a super government .
what then if some country wants out ?
we in the u.s. know what a huge price there was to pay when that was tried here .
do n't do it .
william bellew , u.s.a. let 's see if i 've got this right .
the eu first decides that all member states " must " agree to the nice treaty before it can be implemented .
then it gives ireland the right to vote on , and so effectively veto , the issue .
yet when the irish people decide to reject the nice treaty the eu goes into headless chicken mode .
is n't this all just a teensy bit incompetent ?
andrew duff , uk yes , it is definitely time for a rethink , and to listen to the opinion of the people for a change , and not just the member governments .
otherwise , the eu runs the risk of getting too big and not being accountable to anyone and ignoring the smaller members .
this is already beginning to happen .
why was ireland the only country to ask their population what they thought ?
why is the eu trying to find ways to enlarge anyway despite that decision ?

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- is bigger better for the eu ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo thursday , 21 june , 2001 , 07:47 gmt 08:47 uk is bigger better for the eu ?
as the european union summit gets under way in gothenburg , one word is on everyone 's mind : expansion .
sweden , the summit host , was hoping that this week 's meeting would set a clear timetable for expansion of the eu to include up to 12 new member states .
the nice treaty , agreed last year , had paved the way for that .
but the irish people threw a spanner in the works when they rejected the treaty in a referendum on 7 june .
now the eu has to decide what to do about the irish no vote , while prospective members wait anxiously for a decision .
but is bigger better for the eu ?
should it press ahead with expansion ?
or was the irish vote a call to rethink that strategy ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the eu treatment of the irish vote has confirmed to all their definition of democracy .
their un-elected officials decide upon a policy and put it to the vote .
if the vote is in their favour , then the policy is introduced .
if the vote is not in their favour , then they introduce the policy anyway .
long live democracy !
john gant , uk they have developed and become valuable markets for our exports simon , belgium -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i am astonished at those british contributors to this debate who complain about the cost of subsidising eastern european countries through eu expansion .
do n't they realise that this cost is far lower than the cost of wars , instability and refugees ?
i 'd rather spend my money helping eastern europe become an economic success , than on sending in our army to deal with yet another bosnia or kosovo .
and have these critics taken a look at spain , portugal , greece and ireland ?
all of these countries were economic basket-cases before they joined the eu .
and , yes , the uk helped " subsidise " them .
but now , they have developed and become valuable markets for our exports .
simon , belgium -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- eu expansion is good .
the greater the number of cooks , the more likely the broth will be spoiled .
more members would make it more difficult to gain consensus .
without consensus , the eu might be left as the free trade community we joined thirty years ago without being able to continually infringe upon our rights and sovereignty .
charles macdonald , uk what is this eu to become ?
some of you just want to be bigger to poke your finger into uncle sam 's eye .
i think this dream will come to a halt when the germans realize how much money they are spending to help france realize its goal of ruling europe !
eddie , houston , texas i do n't necessarily think that expansion of the eu is a bad thing in itself if it were purely an issue of breaking down trade barriers .
however , i hope these new member states are going into this with their eyes wide open with regard to their loss of sovereignty in a few years time .
do n't believe what the politicians tell you - a " united states of europe " is inevitable and the men in grey suits will simply not let referendums or protests -lrb- short of a war -rrb- stand in their way .
i hope i 'm wrong but i fear that a federal europe is a recipe for a huge -lrb- what will be by then ' civil ' -rrb- war somewhere down the line that will make bosnia look like a playground scrap .
too many diverse ingredients thrown into the pot will not necessarily make a pleasant tasting soup !
clive , australia -lrb- ex uk -rrb- people on this board from the uk seem to be very right wing ; you do n't seem to like change .
first you want to keep the pound , have no greater involvement in the eu , and now you say you do n't want to enlarge the eu .
labour is in power in the uk , it took 18 years for british people to accept change , i hope it wo n't take another 18 years before the people of the uk realised what is right and support european policies instead of calling them undemocratic .
look at the long term ; eastern europe is the key to europe in the " long term " .
jack homes , european union i have travelled the world in trade fairs and as a company we always said " where there is trade , there is peace " .
where there is trade there is commerce and wealth -lrb- mark dickinson take note -rrb- , but where there is none of this there is envy , greed , corruption and poverty for the majority .
as much as i dislike and criticise both the eu in its structure and rules and regulations , i would say that we have all never had it so good , both in terms of economics and peace , and we should make sure that this is extended to those countries that wish to join us in this spirit .
there will always be an element of " us but not them " .
this morning there was a bus and subway strike in cologne because the buses are likely to be privatised and companies from foreign countries have put in bids which are cheaper than domestic ones !
you ca n't have your cake and eat it !
we are in the eu and those are the rules and the wealth generated is for the good of all , not just a chosen few .
yvonne kirchgaesser , uk / germany let 's try to avoid the polarisation of people into the " yes get bigger " and the " put the barriers up " sides .
no doubt there is much scope for eu enlargement but things should slow down until the existing institutions , systems and practical issues of eu membership are fully understood by the people of states that are already a part of it .
perhaps the irish vote was a shot across the bows of politicians because there is a fear that we do n't understand what we have now never mind further expansion .
dave lynch , england is it any wonder some people feel so frustrated tom bacon , uk i am infuriated by the whole expansionist cause .
not long ago i would n't have minded either way , but the way the eu have ridden roughshod over the democratic decisions made by the irish referendum has been the final straw .
we are supposed to live in a democracy , yet the eu seems to believe it can ignore the vote of the people and , in essence , tell them to " change their minds " .
is it any wonder some people feel so frustrated that they believe violence to be the only thing that gets any attention paid to them ?
tom bacon , uk can anyone blame the protesters when the veiws of the people are being ignored .
tony blair talks about democracy but only if it agrees with his ideas , otherwise it is rubbished by him and his kind .
mike watson , england claims that an expanded eu will " prevent another yugoslavia " -lrb- george , uk -rrb- , yugoslavia is exactly what the eu is becoming - an artificial , oversized and undemocratic federation .
neil , uk yes , expansion is good for europe , but we need more political integration before we expand further .
this is especially true for currency union .
michael zellhorn , uk i agree entirely with di from the usa .
in the states as well as a central federal tax each state has its own levels of income tax , sales tax and the like .
if you do n't like your state you go to another one .
the people are different and the culture may be slightly different but the language is the same .
if you ca n't find work in california but you can in new york , you pack up and move .
if you ca n't find work in ireland and move to hungary for a job the cultural differences are huge , and the language is totally different .
the model of the us simply wo n't work here .
karl peters , uk i have spent some time in the countries of central and eastern europe and i 've found it hard to accept the sense of hopelessness that dominates the spirit of the young there .
these people share the same values as we do .
they did n't ask to be imprisoned under a communist system following the war .
they did n't ask to have their rivers and cities polluted .
the did n't ask to have their infrastructures neglected , they did n't ask for poverty or corruption or poor health - but that 's what they got and now we all have a moral obligation to pitch in and give them a hand .
we must make the process transparent and we must make them accountable for our investment .
the people of eastern europe have suffered long enough .
wayne , eu the politicians seek expansion as it increases their power .
to force so many individual countries into an unwieldy super-state is a recipe for revolution and an open door to dictatorship .
wendy , uk mr blair 's declaration that the anarchists ' protests will not stand in the way of democracy is duplicitous and hypocritical .
the pro-europeans faction claim that the low turn-out for the irish referendum on the nice treaty effectively invalidates its result .
in fact the turn-out for the referendum was higher than that for many of the european elections .
the european political elite should listen to their people 's voice and declare the nice treaty non-ratified and hence null and void .
to bury their head in the sand by ignoring the non-ratification of the treaty and effectively calling for a repeat of the irish referendum until a " yes " vote is obtained is not only undemocratic and imperialistic in the extreme .
moreover it is a recipe for a disaster .
european federalists , ignore your people 's voice at your peril edwin thornber , britain congratulations to the irish who stopped this appalling treaty .
the eu is a threat to national sovereignty of any nation and the states hoping to join are sleepwalking to their own destruction .
the fact that we are even members of the eu is a betrayal of all who died in two world wars to keep the uk independent .
al , uk eastern europe will become a money pit for subsidies gary , england george -lrb- uk -rrb- seems to miss the point .
there may be 200 million in the east wanting to be in , but the 3.5m in ireland who voted against expansion are already members and voted not to expand .
their voices must be heard by the euro politicians .
why should we subsidise the eastern block when we need all our taxes to pay for our health service schools etc. or are these people more important then our children 's education or pensioners .
eastern europe will become a money pit for subsidies and our taxes as well as put many of us out of work as companies go to the cheap labour of the east .
gary , england we are already net contributors to the eu .
with more under-developed countries being admitted this situation will worsen .
with the british transport , health and education services hanging on a knife-edge in the uk anything that draws funds away from these essential services is unjustifiable .
pete , england as a person who voted no to nice , i did so for one reason only .
nice was primarily about the voting arrangements after enlargement .
it was this and it is this alone which the irish people will reject until it is corrected .
we want an eu of thriving , democratic , equals .
not this compromise called nice which only favours the larger countries .
austin rock , ireland i have always thought that the only way to topple americanisation is to counter-act it with europeisation .
honestly speaking , i resent my culture being overwhelmed by burger and pizza chains .
just as france has taken a stand against this by promoting its own culture , so too should the brits , or better still , so too should europe .
together we can be a strong cultural force .
so i say yes to expansion .
eastern europe has a lot to offer us culturally .
as a language graduate , i would love to see a cyrillic language studied in schools as much as french or german .
are we in britain really so inward thinking that we would deprive ourselves of the opportunity to strengthen our position in the world ?
only by boldly entering europe ourselves and promoting our own culture there can we be strong and proud in a european super state .
matthew baines , london , uk no .
economically net contributors to the eu -lrb- like the uk -rrb- will have to massively increase their contributions to pay for these weaker economies and we will lose our right of veto .
will there be a fair referendum on this , that will actually be listened to -lrb- rather than steamrollered and ignored like in ireland -rrb- ?
i can just imagine the wording now : " do you want to see a larger european union or are you a nazi , baby-eating , 3-headed alien ?
yes / no " .
hmmm , let me think .
john , uk does anyone really think they can make the european union any worse ?
the eu 's biggest area of responsibility - agriculture - is a disgrace and the principles of a true democracy have never been respected : if you vote yes the decision is " irrevocable " if you vote no -lrb- as did denmark and ireland -rrb- you vote again !
david buckley , belgium i welcome a larger europe with open arms .
a larger europe means a more peaceful europe .
what more could any peace-loving human being want .
we in the uk need to wake up and realise we are not part of america , we are part of a wonderfully diverse europe .
darren palmer , uk i rather think that a european superpower will not accurately reflect the wishes of the people and each country 's needs .
here in the us each state makes laws and has taxation power at the state level and we can therefore choose where we live if say , we do n't like the death penalty , high taxes , lack of quality education or quality of life issues .
i would not like to see the cultural and social differences which make each european country unique , thrown aside in order to accommodate the lowest common denominator .
a unified europe is one matter , a europe which does not allow demonstrations and public outcry against policy does a disservice to the people .
di stewart , usa while i was cycling through romania last summer i gained a special insight into life outside the european union .
corruption is rife in every area of life - we even had to bribe guards to allow us to carry our bicycles on a train .
basic things we take for granted are subject to the whims of self-appointed petty criminals .
there is a noticeable lack of civic responsibility or solidarity , the result of the chaos of poverty .
i think we should be doing everything possible to extend the freedoms and prosperity we take for granted inside the eu .
apart from being the decent thing to do , it is also important for our own quality of life as it encourages the stability of countries to the east and ensures continued peace on our continent .
i think it is highly selfish of the irish electorate to try in any way to jeopardise the progress of romania and other countries towards achieving a standard of living and quality of life we think of as our birthright .
it is particularly shocking given the way in which ireland has benefited from eu membership .
bharain mac an bhreithiun , ireland i believe that my country has done the eu a favour fiachra , ireland whether or not you agree with the treaty of nice , i believe that my country has done the eu a favour , in that its vote has stimulated debate on the very complex workings of the union - debate which was very much lacking until now .
it is increasingly looking like the eu is going to morph into a vast , unwieldy bureaucracy that is led by the powerful nations - the original signatories of the treaty of rome , chiefly germany , france , uk , spain and italy .
the smaller -lrb- like ireland -rrb- and the weaker -lrb- like the current applicants -rrb- are going to become disillusioned as their already minimal influence dwindles to nothing .
wake up europe - stop !
take stock and listen to debate before you decide to proceed ...
fiachra , ireland why should the eu be bigger ?
soon we will be back to " the world " .
let 's keep it europe and agree with the irish people .
vannetiere , france we need a skilled counterweight to american unilateralism paul connor , canada in the long run , the union could include everyone from reykjavik to vladivostok .
why not ?
where 's the threat ?
by the way , if it was more about harmonising laws -lrb- equality of opportunity -rrb- than wealth -lrb- equality of result -rrb- , any free-market democracy could join right away .
it 's these useless and destructive subsidies that open the question of new , poorer applicants draining the rest of the union .
settle this , europe !
god knows we need a skilled counterweight to american unilateralism , however well intentioned they are .
paul connor , canada enlargement should definitely proceed .
without this " carrot " the eastern european states would be much less far along the road to stability , democracy and development which is good for us too .
an enlarged eu also gives us a larger market for our goods and , for the eurosceptics , it will also slow down closer integration while the eu focuses on enlargement instead .
the irish vote was not a fear of enlargement and anyway , should 3.5m people in ireland block something that 200m in the east want ?
george , uk i am encouraged by stronger ties among the current and possible future eu nations .
the european voice seems to speak with moderation -lrb- on the whole -rrb- .
the stronger the eu , the more i believe we will have continued relative peace .
further , since the eu already surpasses the us in total population as well as gdp , maybe it will become the default fall-guy for the world 's complaints .
we in the us are a little weary of this default status .
william c. soule ' , texas , usa a lot of work remains to be done both inside the eu and in the applying countries michael engman , sweden there is a clear moral obligation of the eu , and a self-evident right for the non-member european countries , that all countries that wish to join and are ready to fulfil the requirements in the legal , economic and democratic framework are welcome .
a lot of work remains to be done both inside the eu and in the applying countries .
the " in-the-club " citizens should focus more of their attention on how we can make this place a peaceful , stable and prosperous area for all europeans .
michael engman , sweden as long as everyone wants to be included and actively involved , there will always be room for a larger europe .
if there must be a central government , that is ok , as long as it is not in germany .
they have tried several times to control europe , let 's not be blind .
costas , hellenic republic the eu will expand to become the world government .
it will merge with the up and coming north american union and the asian union .
then all countries will have to fall into the ranks or be left behind economically .
this is not an " if " but a " when " .
barry jocelyn , canada europe must be for the people - but not run by them !
alex pinkerton , scotland only when the countries of the east become full members of the european family , can the goal of a truly united and integrated europe become a reality .
this will not only guarantee peace and stability on a continental scale , it will also help to balance the undue power wielded by the united states .
that is why the referendum in ireland should not be viewed as " done and dusted " .
as a dedicated european i agree with the brussels line that , europe must be for the people - but not run by them !
alex pinkerton , scotland firstly , i would like to say that the irish people are not against enlargement they are against the new system of voting in the eu where they would lose their commissioner and the veto .
concerns about the rapid reaction force are there too .
the candidate countries think that they will have the same opportunities that we had when they join the eu , they will not .
when we joined we had more power within the eec as it was then known and we had the veto which we could use if something in a proposed treaty did n't agree with us .
by the time these countries join they will be under this new system where the bigger countries will have more votes than the smaller ones so they will not have a veto .
francis dunne , ireland why are n't the people of the current eu member states given more information about enlargement ?
how will the eu be able to support the extra countries as the farming policy is already a shambles ?
how can it hope to cope with underdeveloped eastern europe countries .
it would cost a fortune to apply the social policy alone - who would foot the bill ?
steve bentley , uk i think it is time for the rest of the world to wake up to the fact that eastern european countries have always been part of european culture - perhaps much more so than anglo-saxon countries -lrb- save for 40 odd years of unpleasant distraction -rrb- and , as such , have a lot more to offer than just being the " poor relatives " .
education , the health service , not to mention young people 's attitudes and behaviour , compare very favourably to the uk , for example .
excluding these countries from the eu is also very shortsighted .
eva w , uk -lrb- from hungary -rrb- we have never had the chance to vote on whether to become part of a super-state stephen phillips , england although i did n't vote for the ukip in the recent elections , i can understand their concerns .
we have never had the chance to vote on whether to become part of a super-state .
the common market we voted to remain in in 1975 has changed beyond recognition .
we should insist that our government gives us the chance to decide how much further - if at all - we should submerge ourselves in a euro-superstate .
stephen phillips , england this may appear as a unification of governments , but remember that at the root of this are the people of europe who aspire to an end of divisions and bloody history .
this is a unification of people for solidarity and the preservation of our culture .
i say bring in the turks , the balkans and our east european cousins , then we can truly call ourselves the european union .
this may need some sacrifice at first , but the rewards in the long term will far exceed anybody 's expectations today !
vrata , france / uk whenever the " little people " get to vote on europe they vote against it .
the danes rejected the euro despite overwhelming media support .
the irish rejected the nice treaty .
support in the uk is less than 50 % , support in germany is dropping rapidly yet the powers that be insist on steamrollering through their plans .
i always thought democracy was about representing the people , not ignoring the vote and trying again claiming people were too stupid to understand the question .
firstly if people are too stupid to understand a simple question they should n't be voting .
secondly , what is the hidden agenda here ?
nobody except the politicians seems to want to enlarge .
john b , uk a no vote means that eu politicians should at least sit up and take note .
except they have so little power to call the council of ministers to account , who seem hell bent on the project no matter what , and so the eu politicians will get overruled .
i am not anti-european as closer integration would appear to produce real benefits for my family and myself .
i just want to keep certain people who claim to speak on my behalf on a shorter leash .
steve dixey , uk it is of great importance that we get as many european nations under the union umbrella as possible .
currently europe is the home of moderate and advanced thinking .
we should do everything in our power to get this culture of reason , peace and global understanding expanded as far as it is naturally possible .
mikko toivonen , finland why does the eu have to be bigger and better than the us ?
c. williams , england why does the eu have to be bigger and better than the us ?
the us has given the world so much in the last century - mostly at the expense of france and germany - that we should be joining with them , not going against them .
c. williams , england the idea of getting larger and larger is something that frightens me .
instead of solving problems and creating welfare and stability , we are going to make problems .
i think we must finish enlargement with poland , hungary , the czech republic , norway and switzerland -lrb- if they want -rrb- and from then on put our energy into each other to solve internal disagreements and set common goals for the future .
all members of the eu , despite their differences , have a common cultural background .
let 's not throw away such unwritten , unspoken understandings !
reinier bosman , the netherlands while i do indeed believe in the eu , i am concerned about the notion that expansion will lead to the loss of national identity .
this may sound odd coming from a german , but i fear that we will lose our currencies -lrb- already lost -rrb- , national identities , and possibly languages all for a united europe .
i am proud to be european , but i am also proud to be a german .
mathias , germany the european elite has waged a propaganda war against its own inhabitants about the benefits of expansion .
the fact of the matter is that some brains have n't been washed .
all of those who find themselves to be immune to the eu plague have no desire to lose the sovereignty of their homelands to the ussr sequel .
ashlon , texas , usa the eu needs to get its house in order before expanding further euan gray , uk firstly , the nice treaty is only peripherally about enlargement .
existing treaties permit the eu to admit a further five countries at any time .
to state that the irish " no " vote prejudices enlargement is untrue .
secondly , the eu needs to get its house in order before expanding further .
the cap , as currently formulated , would bankrupt the eu if the applicant countries were added - things like this need to get resolved first .
euan gray , uk sure that it is better .
with a bigger eu we will have more prosperity and opportunities as well as a more powerful voice .
we can also maintain the most important and difficult thing to obtain - peace .
this is the road for a united europe where every minority is recognised and were everyone has human rights .
the small island of malta is eager to join our ' bigger brother ' and we hope to join the more prosperous present eu countries and also the developing eastern ones - one whole united europe .
mark , malta i note that the rest of the eu people do not get a choice robert , uk the nice treaty was not just about expansion ; it also included areas that irish people were not happy about .
the possible loss of their neutrality due to being forced to co-operate in the rapid reaction force .
if these treaties were concerned with a single area rather than trying to cover a multitude of areas , then perhaps they would be more likely to be agreed if and when the masses get a chance to vote and choose .
i note that the rest of the eu people do not get a choice .
the politicians get the choice .
if these treaties did n't try and sneak things through in the small print there might be more agreement .
robert , uk i travel widely across the ec , and have been noticing that political opinion is leaning further and further to the right with regards to immigrants .
whilst i support the expansion , i do n't know if political stability could cope with accepting these new countries into the ec .
i have n't forgotten what happened in the 30 's and 40 's .
alex banks , uk , living in holland bigger is definitely better for the eu -lrb- how else can we offer a counterbalance to the usa ? -rrb- but not yet .
we need to reform the current institutions to make them more streamlined and accountable before they become too large through expansion , making the necessary changes more difficult .
mark , uk of course we should expand the eu .
it 'll make europe more stable by enforcing common laws to protect minorities and prevent another yugoslavia .
it 'll also give existing eu members a stronger european voice in the world and help bring russia closer too .
our investors gain access to cheap skilled labour and they in turn become consumers for our goods .
it 's a win win situation .
george , uk the irish vote is a message for the eu to slow down the pace for a bigger union namara , canada the irish vote is a message for the eu to slow down the pace for a bigger union .
normally , pacts signed in a hurry have flaws that may impede the progress of the union as originally envisioned .
the " fighting irish " , have their interests at heart that have to be listened to .
their economy is doing well at the moment .
so for now , the rush to unionise the whole europe is on the backburner .
namara , canada i think that all depends on what the aims of expansion are .
if it is to create a super-state which puts wealth and commerce at the top of the agenda in order to create even fatter cats then i would resist expansion .
however , if it is for the good of more people , so that we richer nations can help bring about a more peaceful existence and higher standard of living to poorer nations , then i 'm all for it .
i ca n't help thinking that no votes are really saying , ' we do n't want dragging down by these eastern european poor relatives ' , which is very sad indeed .
mark dickinson , nottingham , england expansion should definitely not go ahead now .
before any enlargement the eu institutions have to be reformed to be more flexible and democratic because otherwise the eu will suffocate in bureaucracy .
i 'm amazed that many british are against more democratic powers for the eu but in favour of expansion .
if you think the eu is inefficient now , how do you expect it to work when 25 countries have to vote unanimously ?
i think it 's time for all of us to come out of the national caves and develop a stronger ' european spirit ' .
if that happens , fine , if not , forget expansion .
it will destroy the union .
carl meyer , uk -lrb- from germany -rrb- this is a unique opportunity for europe to become a united country , let 's do it jean pournaras , greece from the time of the romans the struggle for a greater europe has been going on and on by force .
now most of the europeans want to unite of their own accord and we have people rejecting it ?
this is a unique opportunity for europe to become a united country , let 's do it .
jean pournaras , greece it will be a sad if this union turns into a super government .
what then if some country wants out ?
we in the u.s. know what a huge price there was to pay when that was tried here .
do n't do it .
william bellew , u.s.a. let 's see if i 've got this right .
the eu first decides that all member states " must " agree to the nice treaty before it can be implemented .
then it gives ireland the right to vote on , and so effectively veto , the issue .
yet when the irish people decide to reject the nice treaty the eu goes into headless chicken mode .
is n't this all just a teensy bit incompetent ?
andrew duff , uk yes , it is definitely time for a rethink , and to listen to the opinion of the people for a change , and not just the member governments .
otherwise , the eu runs the risk of getting too big and not being accountable to anyone and ignoring the smaller members .
this is already beginning to happen .
why was ireland the only country to ask their population what they thought ?
why is the eu trying to find ways to enlarge anyway despite that decision ?

as the european union summit gets under way in gothenburg , one word is on everyone 's mind : expansion .
sweden , the summit host , was hoping that this week 's meeting would set a clear timetable for expansion of the eu to include up to 12 new member states .
the nice treaty , agreed last year , had paved the way for that .
but the irish people threw a spanner in the works when they rejected the treaty in a referendum on 7 june .
now the eu has to decide what to do about the irish no vote , while prospective members wait anxiously for a decision .
but is bigger better for the eu ?
should it press ahead with expansion ?
or was the irish vote a call to rethink that strategy ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the eu treatment of the irish vote has confirmed to all their definition of democracy .
their un-elected officials decide upon a policy and put it to the vote .
if the vote is in their favour , then the policy is introduced .
if the vote is not in their favour , then they introduce the policy anyway .
long live democracy !
john gant , uk they have developed and become valuable markets for our exports simon , belgium -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- i am astonished at those british contributors to this debate who complain about the cost of subsidising eastern european countries through eu expansion .
do n't they realise that this cost is far lower than the cost of wars , instability and refugees ?
i 'd rather spend my money helping eastern europe become an economic success , than on sending in our army to deal with yet another bosnia or kosovo .
and have these critics taken a look at spain , portugal , greece and ireland ?
all of these countries were economic basket-cases before they joined the eu .
and , yes , the uk helped " subsidise " them .
but now , they have developed and become valuable markets for our exports .
simon , belgium -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- eu expansion is good .
the greater the number of cooks , the more likely the broth will be spoiled .
more members would make it more difficult to gain consensus .
without consensus , the eu might be left as the free trade community we joined thirty years ago without being able to continually infringe upon our rights and sovereignty .
charles macdonald , uk what is this eu to become ?
some of you just want to be bigger to poke your finger into uncle sam 's eye .
i think this dream will come to a halt when the germans realize how much money they are spending to help france realize its goal of ruling europe !
eddie , houston , texas i do n't necessarily think that expansion of the eu is a bad thing in itself if it were purely an issue of breaking down trade barriers .
however , i hope these new member states are going into this with their eyes wide open with regard to their loss of sovereignty in a few years time .
do n't believe what the politicians tell you - a " united states of europe " is inevitable and the men in grey suits will simply not let referendums or protests -lrb- short of a war -rrb- stand in their way .
i hope i 'm wrong but i fear that a federal europe is a recipe for a huge -lrb- what will be by then ' civil ' -rrb- war somewhere down the line that will make bosnia look like a playground scrap .
too many diverse ingredients thrown into the pot will not necessarily make a pleasant tasting soup !
clive , australia -lrb- ex uk -rrb- people on this board from the uk seem to be very right wing ; you do n't seem to like change .
first you want to keep the pound , have no greater involvement in the eu , and now you say you do n't want to enlarge the eu .
labour is in power in the uk , it took 18 years for british people to accept change , i hope it wo n't take another 18 years before the people of the uk realised what is right and support european policies instead of calling them undemocratic .
look at the long term ; eastern europe is the key to europe in the " long term " .
jack homes , european union i have travelled the world in trade fairs and as a company we always said " where there is trade , there is peace " .
where there is trade there is commerce and wealth -lrb- mark dickinson take note -rrb- , but where there is none of this there is envy , greed , corruption and poverty for the majority .
as much as i dislike and criticise both the eu in its structure and rules and regulations , i would say that we have all never had it so good , both in terms of economics and peace , and we should make sure that this is extended to those countries that wish to join us in this spirit .
there will always be an element of " us but not them " .
this morning there was a bus and subway strike in cologne because the buses are likely to be privatised and companies from foreign countries have put in bids which are cheaper than domestic ones !
you ca n't have your cake and eat it !
we are in the eu and those are the rules and the wealth generated is for the good of all , not just a chosen few .
yvonne kirchgaesser , uk / germany let 's try to avoid the polarisation of people into the " yes get bigger " and the " put the barriers up " sides .
no doubt there is much scope for eu enlargement but things should slow down until the existing institutions , systems and practical issues of eu membership are fully understood by the people of states that are already a part of it .
perhaps the irish vote was a shot across the bows of politicians because there is a fear that we do n't understand what we have now never mind further expansion .
dave lynch , england is it any wonder some people feel so frustrated tom bacon , uk i am infuriated by the whole expansionist cause .
not long ago i would n't have minded either way , but the way the eu have ridden roughshod over the democratic decisions made by the irish referendum has been the final straw .
we are supposed to live in a democracy , yet the eu seems to believe it can ignore the vote of the people and , in essence , tell them to " change their minds " .
is it any wonder some people feel so frustrated that they believe violence to be the only thing that gets any attention paid to them ?
tom bacon , uk can anyone blame the protesters when the veiws of the people are being ignored .
tony blair talks about democracy but only if it agrees with his ideas , otherwise it is rubbished by him and his kind .
mike watson , england claims that an expanded eu will " prevent another yugoslavia " -lrb- george , uk -rrb- , yugoslavia is exactly what the eu is becoming - an artificial , oversized and undemocratic federation .
neil , uk yes , expansion is good for europe , but we need more political integration before we expand further .
this is especially true for currency union .
michael zellhorn , uk i agree entirely with di from the usa .
in the states as well as a central federal tax each state has its own levels of income tax , sales tax and the like .
if you do n't like your state you go to another one .
the people are different and the culture may be slightly different but the language is the same .
if you ca n't find work in california but you can in new york , you pack up and move .
if you ca n't find work in ireland and move to hungary for a job the cultural differences are huge , and the language is totally different .
the model of the us simply wo n't work here .
karl peters , uk i have spent some time in the countries of central and eastern europe and i 've found it hard to accept the sense of hopelessness that dominates the spirit of the young there .
these people share the same values as we do .
they did n't ask to be imprisoned under a communist system following the war .
they did n't ask to have their rivers and cities polluted .
the did n't ask to have their infrastructures neglected , they did n't ask for poverty or corruption or poor health - but that 's what they got and now we all have a moral obligation to pitch in and give them a hand .
we must make the process transparent and we must make them accountable for our investment .
the people of eastern europe have suffered long enough .
wayne , eu the politicians seek expansion as it increases their power .
to force so many individual countries into an unwieldy super-state is a recipe for revolution and an open door to dictatorship .
wendy , uk mr blair 's declaration that the anarchists ' protests will not stand in the way of democracy is duplicitous and hypocritical .
the pro-europeans faction claim that the low turn-out for the irish referendum on the nice treaty effectively invalidates its result .
in fact the turn-out for the referendum was higher than that for many of the european elections .
the european political elite should listen to their people 's voice and declare the nice treaty non-ratified and hence null and void .
to bury their head in the sand by ignoring the non-ratification of the treaty and effectively calling for a repeat of the irish referendum until a " yes " vote is obtained is not only undemocratic and imperialistic in the extreme .
moreover it is a recipe for a disaster .
european federalists , ignore your people 's voice at your peril edwin thornber , britain congratulations to the irish who stopped this appalling treaty .
the eu is a threat to national sovereignty of any nation and the states hoping to join are sleepwalking to their own destruction .
the fact that we are even members of the eu is a betrayal of all who died in two world wars to keep the uk independent .
al , uk eastern europe will become a money pit for subsidies gary , england george -lrb- uk -rrb- seems to miss the point .
there may be 200 million in the east wanting to be in , but the 3.5m in ireland who voted against expansion are already members and voted not to expand .
their voices must be heard by the euro politicians .
why should we subsidise the eastern block when we need all our taxes to pay for our health service schools etc. or are these people more important then our children 's education or pensioners .
eastern europe will become a money pit for subsidies and our taxes as well as put many of us out of work as companies go to the cheap labour of the east .
gary , england we are already net contributors to the eu .
with more under-developed countries being admitted this situation will worsen .
with the british transport , health and education services hanging on a knife-edge in the uk anything that draws funds away from these essential services is unjustifiable .
pete , england as a person who voted no to nice , i did so for one reason only .
nice was primarily about the voting arrangements after enlargement .
it was this and it is this alone which the irish people will reject until it is corrected .
we want an eu of thriving , democratic , equals .
not this compromise called nice which only favours the larger countries .
austin rock , ireland i have always thought that the only way to topple americanisation is to counter-act it with europeisation .
honestly speaking , i resent my culture being overwhelmed by burger and pizza chains .
just as france has taken a stand against this by promoting its own culture , so too should the brits , or better still , so too should europe .
together we can be a strong cultural force .
so i say yes to expansion .
eastern europe has a lot to offer us culturally .
as a language graduate , i would love to see a cyrillic language studied in schools as much as french or german .
are we in britain really so inward thinking that we would deprive ourselves of the opportunity to strengthen our position in the world ?
only by boldly entering europe ourselves and promoting our own culture there can we be strong and proud in a european super state .
matthew baines , london , uk no .
economically net contributors to the eu -lrb- like the uk -rrb- will have to massively increase their contributions to pay for these weaker economies and we will lose our right of veto .
will there be a fair referendum on this , that will actually be listened to -lrb- rather than steamrollered and ignored like in ireland -rrb- ?
i can just imagine the wording now : " do you want to see a larger european union or are you a nazi , baby-eating , 3-headed alien ?
yes / no " .
hmmm , let me think .
john , uk does anyone really think they can make the european union any worse ?
the eu 's biggest area of responsibility - agriculture - is a disgrace and the principles of a true democracy have never been respected : if you vote yes the decision is " irrevocable " if you vote no -lrb- as did denmark and ireland -rrb- you vote again !
david buckley , belgium i welcome a larger europe with open arms .
a larger europe means a more peaceful europe .
what more could any peace-loving human being want .
we in the uk need to wake up and realise we are not part of america , we are part of a wonderfully diverse europe .
darren palmer , uk i rather think that a european superpower will not accurately reflect the wishes of the people and each country 's needs .
here in the us each state makes laws and has taxation power at the state level and we can therefore choose where we live if say , we do n't like the death penalty , high taxes , lack of quality education or quality of life issues .
i would not like to see the cultural and social differences which make each european country unique , thrown aside in order to accommodate the lowest common denominator .
a unified europe is one matter , a europe which does not allow demonstrations and public outcry against policy does a disservice to the people .
di stewart , usa while i was cycling through romania last summer i gained a special insight into life outside the european union .
corruption is rife in every area of life - we even had to bribe guards to allow us to carry our bicycles on a train .
basic things we take for granted are subject to the whims of self-appointed petty criminals .
there is a noticeable lack of civic responsibility or solidarity , the result of the chaos of poverty .
i think we should be doing everything possible to extend the freedoms and prosperity we take for granted inside the eu .
apart from being the decent thing to do , it is also important for our own quality of life as it encourages the stability of countries to the east and ensures continued peace on our continent .
i think it is highly selfish of the irish electorate to try in any way to jeopardise the progress of romania and other countries towards achieving a standard of living and quality of life we think of as our birthright .
it is particularly shocking given the way in which ireland has benefited from eu membership .
bharain mac an bhreithiun , ireland i believe that my country has done the eu a favour fiachra , ireland whether or not you agree with the treaty of nice , i believe that my country has done the eu a favour , in that its vote has stimulated debate on the very complex workings of the union - debate which was very much lacking until now .
it is increasingly looking like the eu is going to morph into a vast , unwieldy bureaucracy that is led by the powerful nations - the original signatories of the treaty of rome , chiefly germany , france , uk , spain and italy .
the smaller -lrb- like ireland -rrb- and the weaker -lrb- like the current applicants -rrb- are going to become disillusioned as their already minimal influence dwindles to nothing .
wake up europe - stop !
take stock and listen to debate before you decide to proceed ...
fiachra , ireland why should the eu be bigger ?
soon we will be back to " the world " .
let 's keep it europe and agree with the irish people .
vannetiere , france we need a skilled counterweight to american unilateralism paul connor , canada in the long run , the union could include everyone from reykjavik to vladivostok .
why not ?
where 's the threat ?
by the way , if it was more about harmonising laws -lrb- equality of opportunity -rrb- than wealth -lrb- equality of result -rrb- , any free-market democracy could join right away .
it 's these useless and destructive subsidies that open the question of new , poorer applicants draining the rest of the union .
settle this , europe !
god knows we need a skilled counterweight to american unilateralism , however well intentioned they are .
paul connor , canada enlargement should definitely proceed .
without this " carrot " the eastern european states would be much less far along the road to stability , democracy and development which is good for us too .
an enlarged eu also gives us a larger market for our goods and , for the eurosceptics , it will also slow down closer integration while the eu focuses on enlargement instead .
the irish vote was not a fear of enlargement and anyway , should 3.5m people in ireland block something that 200m in the east want ?
george , uk i am encouraged by stronger ties among the current and possible future eu nations .
the european voice seems to speak with moderation -lrb- on the whole -rrb- .
the stronger the eu , the more i believe we will have continued relative peace .
further , since the eu already surpasses the us in total population as well as gdp , maybe it will become the default fall-guy for the world 's complaints .
we in the us are a little weary of this default status .
william c. soule ' , texas , usa a lot of work remains to be done both inside the eu and in the applying countries michael engman , sweden there is a clear moral obligation of the eu , and a self-evident right for the non-member european countries , that all countries that wish to join and are ready to fulfil the requirements in the legal , economic and democratic framework are welcome .
a lot of work remains to be done both inside the eu and in the applying countries .
the " in-the-club " citizens should focus more of their attention on how we can make this place a peaceful , stable and prosperous area for all europeans .
michael engman , sweden as long as everyone wants to be included and actively involved , there will always be room for a larger europe .
if there must be a central government , that is ok , as long as it is not in germany .
they have tried several times to control europe , let 's not be blind .
costas , hellenic republic the eu will expand to become the world government .
it will merge with the up and coming north american union and the asian union .
then all countries will have to fall into the ranks or be left behind economically .
this is not an " if " but a " when " .
barry jocelyn , canada europe must be for the people - but not run by them !
alex pinkerton , scotland only when the countries of the east become full members of the european family , can the goal of a truly united and integrated europe become a reality .
this will not only guarantee peace and stability on a continental scale , it will also help to balance the undue power wielded by the united states .
that is why the referendum in ireland should not be viewed as " done and dusted " .
as a dedicated european i agree with the brussels line that , europe must be for the people - but not run by them !
alex pinkerton , scotland firstly , i would like to say that the irish people are not against enlargement they are against the new system of voting in the eu where they would lose their commissioner and the veto .
concerns about the rapid reaction force are there too .
the candidate countries think that they will have the same opportunities that we had when they join the eu , they will not .
when we joined we had more power within the eec as it was then known and we had the veto which we could use if something in a proposed treaty did n't agree with us .
by the time these countries join they will be under this new system where the bigger countries will have more votes than the smaller ones so they will not have a veto .
francis dunne , ireland why are n't the people of the current eu member states given more information about enlargement ?
how will the eu be able to support the extra countries as the farming policy is already a shambles ?
how can it hope to cope with underdeveloped eastern europe countries .
it would cost a fortune to apply the social policy alone - who would foot the bill ?
steve bentley , uk i think it is time for the rest of the world to wake up to the fact that eastern european countries have always been part of european culture - perhaps much more so than anglo-saxon countries -lrb- save for 40 odd years of unpleasant distraction -rrb- and , as such , have a lot more to offer than just being the " poor relatives " .
education , the health service , not to mention young people 's attitudes and behaviour , compare very favourably to the uk , for example .
excluding these countries from the eu is also very shortsighted .
eva w , uk -lrb- from hungary -rrb- we have never had the chance to vote on whether to become part of a super-state stephen phillips , england although i did n't vote for the ukip in the recent elections , i can understand their concerns .
we have never had the chance to vote on whether to become part of a super-state .
the common market we voted to remain in in 1975 has changed beyond recognition .
we should insist that our government gives us the chance to decide how much further - if at all - we should submerge ourselves in a euro-superstate .
stephen phillips , england this may appear as a unification of governments , but remember that at the root of this are the people of europe who aspire to an end of divisions and bloody history .
this is a unification of people for solidarity and the preservation of our culture .
i say bring in the turks , the balkans and our east european cousins , then we can truly call ourselves the european union .
this may need some sacrifice at first , but the rewards in the long term will far exceed anybody 's expectations today !
vrata , france / uk whenever the " little people " get to vote on europe they vote against it .
the danes rejected the euro despite overwhelming media support .
the irish rejected the nice treaty .
support in the uk is less than 50 % , support in germany is dropping rapidly yet the powers that be insist on steamrollering through their plans .
i always thought democracy was about representing the people , not ignoring the vote and trying again claiming people were too stupid to understand the question .
firstly if people are too stupid to understand a simple question they should n't be voting .
secondly , what is the hidden agenda here ?
nobody except the politicians seems to want to enlarge .
john b , uk a no vote means that eu politicians should at least sit up and take note .
except they have so little power to call the council of ministers to account , who seem hell bent on the project no matter what , and so the eu politicians will get overruled .
i am not anti-european as closer integration would appear to produce real benefits for my family and myself .
i just want to keep certain people who claim to speak on my behalf on a shorter leash .
steve dixey , uk it is of great importance that we get as many european nations under the union umbrella as possible .
currently europe is the home of moderate and advanced thinking .
we should do everything in our power to get this culture of reason , peace and global understanding expanded as far as it is naturally possible .
mikko toivonen , finland why does the eu have to be bigger and better than the us ?
c. williams , england why does the eu have to be bigger and better than the us ?
the us has given the world so much in the last century - mostly at the expense of france and germany - that we should be joining with them , not going against them .
c. williams , england the idea of getting larger and larger is something that frightens me .
instead of solving problems and creating welfare and stability , we are going to make problems .
i think we must finish enlargement with poland , hungary , the czech republic , norway and switzerland -lrb- if they want -rrb- and from then on put our energy into each other to solve internal disagreements and set common goals for the future .
all members of the eu , despite their differences , have a common cultural background .
let 's not throw away such unwritten , unspoken understandings !
reinier bosman , the netherlands while i do indeed believe in the eu , i am concerned about the notion that expansion will lead to the loss of national identity .
this may sound odd coming from a german , but i fear that we will lose our currencies -lrb- already lost -rrb- , national identities , and possibly languages all for a united europe .
i am proud to be european , but i am also proud to be a german .
mathias , germany the european elite has waged a propaganda war against its own inhabitants about the benefits of expansion .
the fact of the matter is that some brains have n't been washed .
all of those who find themselves to be immune to the eu plague have no desire to lose the sovereignty of their homelands to the ussr sequel .
ashlon , texas , usa the eu needs to get its house in order before expanding further euan gray , uk firstly , the nice treaty is only peripherally about enlargement .
existing treaties permit the eu to admit a further five countries at any time .
to state that the irish " no " vote prejudices enlargement is untrue .
secondly , the eu needs to get its house in order before expanding further .
the cap , as currently formulated , would bankrupt the eu if the applicant countries were added - things like this need to get resolved first .
euan gray , uk sure that it is better .
with a bigger eu we will have more prosperity and opportunities as well as a more powerful voice .
we can also maintain the most important and difficult thing to obtain - peace .
this is the road for a united europe where every minority is recognised and were everyone has human rights .
the small island of malta is eager to join our ' bigger brother ' and we hope to join the more prosperous present eu countries and also the developing eastern ones - one whole united europe .
mark , malta i note that the rest of the eu people do not get a choice robert , uk the nice treaty was not just about expansion ; it also included areas that irish people were not happy about .
the possible loss of their neutrality due to being forced to co-operate in the rapid reaction force .
if these treaties were concerned with a single area rather than trying to cover a multitude of areas , then perhaps they would be more likely to be agreed if and when the masses get a chance to vote and choose .
i note that the rest of the eu people do not get a choice .
the politicians get the choice .
if these treaties did n't try and sneak things through in the small print there might be more agreement .
robert , uk i travel widely across the ec , and have been noticing that political opinion is leaning further and further to the right with regards to immigrants .
whilst i support the expansion , i do n't know if political stability could cope with accepting these new countries into the ec .
i have n't forgotten what happened in the 30 's and 40 's .
alex banks , uk , living in holland bigger is definitely better for the eu -lrb- how else can we offer a counterbalance to the usa ? -rrb- but not yet .
we need to reform the current institutions to make them more streamlined and accountable before they become too large through expansion , making the necessary changes more difficult .
mark , uk of course we should expand the eu .
it 'll make europe more stable by enforcing common laws to protect minorities and prevent another yugoslavia .
it 'll also give existing eu members a stronger european voice in the world and help bring russia closer too .
our investors gain access to cheap skilled labour and they in turn become consumers for our goods .
it 's a win win situation .
george , uk the irish vote is a message for the eu to slow down the pace for a bigger union namara , canada the irish vote is a message for the eu to slow down the pace for a bigger union .
normally , pacts signed in a hurry have flaws that may impede the progress of the union as originally envisioned .
the " fighting irish " , have their interests at heart that have to be listened to .
their economy is doing well at the moment .
so for now , the rush to unionise the whole europe is on the backburner .
namara , canada i think that all depends on what the aims of expansion are .
if it is to create a super-state which puts wealth and commerce at the top of the agenda in order to create even fatter cats then i would resist expansion .
however , if it is for the good of more people , so that we richer nations can help bring about a more peaceful existence and higher standard of living to poorer nations , then i 'm all for it .
i ca n't help thinking that no votes are really saying , ' we do n't want dragging down by these eastern european poor relatives ' , which is very sad indeed .
mark dickinson , nottingham , england expansion should definitely not go ahead now .
before any enlargement the eu institutions have to be reformed to be more flexible and democratic because otherwise the eu will suffocate in bureaucracy .
i 'm amazed that many british are against more democratic powers for the eu but in favour of expansion .
if you think the eu is inefficient now , how do you expect it to work when 25 countries have to vote unanimously ?
i think it 's time for all of us to come out of the national caves and develop a stronger ' european spirit ' .
if that happens , fine , if not , forget expansion .
it will destroy the union .
carl meyer , uk -lrb- from germany -rrb- this is a unique opportunity for europe to become a united country , let 's do it jean pournaras , greece from the time of the romans the struggle for a greater europe has been going on and on by force .
now most of the europeans want to unite of their own accord and we have people rejecting it ?
this is a unique opportunity for europe to become a united country , let 's do it .
jean pournaras , greece it will be a sad if this union turns into a super government .
what then if some country wants out ?
we in the u.s. know what a huge price there was to pay when that was tried here .
do n't do it .
william bellew , u.s.a. let 's see if i 've got this right .
the eu first decides that all member states " must " agree to the nice treaty before it can be implemented .
then it gives ireland the right to vote on , and so effectively veto , the issue .
yet when the irish people decide to reject the nice treaty the eu goes into headless chicken mode .
is n't this all just a teensy bit incompetent ?
andrew duff , uk yes , it is definitely time for a rethink , and to listen to the opinion of the people for a change , and not just the member governments .
otherwise , the eu runs the risk of getting too big and not being accountable to anyone and ignoring the smaller members .
this is already beginning to happen .
why was ireland the only country to ask their population what they thought ?
why is the eu trying to find ways to enlarge anyway despite that decision ?

select a link below to watch talking point on air president george w bush has faced angry demonstrators during his first tour of europe since coming to the white house .
europeans are angry that the bush administration has turned its back on the kyoto treaty on tackling global warming and the russians are particularly fearful of the contentious us missile defence plans .
despite a huge volume of transatlantic trade and political co-operation between europe and america there is also a seemingly immense cultural divide .
on issues from defence and the environment to abortion and the death penalty , it seems there is a growing european rebellion against american values and culture .
can the gulf between the two western power blocks be bridged or is the transatlantic alliance coming to an end ?
is america now out of touch with the rest of the world ?
robin lustig was joined by tom reid from the washington post for talking point on air , a radio phone-in programme on bbc world service and bbc news online .

this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction your comments since the programme your comments during the programme your comments before the programme your comments since the programme it amazes me everyday that people around the globe still buy into the american theme of democracy .
bush has been appointed by the court .
we in america are now represented by a frightened man who wants to conduct his business behind closed doors .
it is a sad state of democracy , but it has long been this way .
and , look at his father , who continues his reign as the most powerful man in the world .
bush is more the puppet than even reagan .
please , understand this , and the fact that , yes , we americans could benefit from a more european point-of-view on the state of the world .
todd kearns , mancos , colorado , usa i have only read one comment from the usa on this subject , and find it typical .
it is all regarding europe not being a military super-power , claiming that the eu could not exist without the us !
only the usa is interested in being a military super-power !
despite what the uk government -lrb- the us ' lapdog , might i add -rrb- thinks , the rest of the eu in no way " needs " the usa , nor their interference in european affairs .
two thumbs up to france and germany for giving the two-fingered salute to george bush .
not all americans like this president , nor their government .
i am hoping to soon become an eu citizen myself .
phil jurament , boston usa millions of people have fled europe over the past several centuries , and we would do well to remember why l cacchio , missouri usa millions of people have fled europe over the past several centuries , and we would do well to remember why .
it was n't because europe offered too much freedom , or too much hope , or too much prosperity , or too few wars , or too much tolerance of divergent views .
on what basis can we say that the european world view in superior to the american ?
l cacchio , missouri usa i think that europe is plagued with arrogance .
europe needs america but america could easily survive without europe .
i spilled my blood in europe fighting in a regional conflict .
many of my close friends died on the beaches of france so that you could be free .
and yet you are still arrogant and feel higher than americans .
if it were not for america , right now britain would be a mere diocese of the third reich .
and after the war with the marshal plan and truman doctrine we rebuilt europe and americans sent their tax dollars over there to save you from communism .
we rebuilt your economies and our militaries protected you .
america has been there every step of the way to hold your hands and tell you its ok .
and now when your american made economies start to work you want to leave us in the dust .
you could not survive ten weeks without america .
tom lukens , illinois , usa the issue is not whether europe needs the u.s. or vice-versa .
it 's plainly obvious we need each other and should demand an even greater relationship from one another for the greater good of everyone .
the issue is rather , how does the u.s. develop a greater sense of global responsibility beyond its traditional role as military presence and treaty broker ?
and how do europeans develop a greater sense of self-reliance and become a greater force in persuading americans to be more internationally responsible ?
americans , as a manner of habit , are uncomfortable with government leading an active role in any large-scale project .
this is a major flaw and phobia in the american way of thinking .
americans like the idea of government as , at the most , a passive moderator , and not an active provider or regulator .
americans distrust government as being conscious and responsible , but rather usually see government as wasteful and self-serving .
ed nicholson , los angeles i 'm tired of the comments of my fellow disenchanted americans saying that they disagree with our president 's policy , so the eu needs to teach us a lesson .
the idea behind our country is that it is governed " by the people " , and the only reason that it feels like we do n't have control is that lazy , complacent americans let it get this way .
did you vote ?
only 4 out of 10 of us did in the last election .
if you want to make change , back it up with your actions .
it 's very easy to write to a congress person , it 's very easy to get to a voting booth .
do n't sit back and expect someone else to " punish " us with sanctions .
let 's not let is get that bad .
change is needed now , and all you have to do is vote in your local elections .
jeffrey mcdonald , san diego , ca , usa the eu needs the us more than the us needs the eu .
the business news just mentioned that if california were a nation , it had just passed france as being the fifth most productive " country " .
the population of california is 36m and france is 58m .
many parts of the eu have repressive tax rates and layers of unneeded of management that stifle business growth .
many eu businesses prefer to be in a lower tax country , such as ireland .
i would be in favour , subject to a mutual vote , of making the uk the 51st state and forget worrying about the rest of europe .
john king , eugene , oregon , usa i think that the european union needs the americans as well as the americans need the european union to exist .
dr victor , donetsk , ukraine i believe it is up to the eu to put its foot down and say " enough " pieter klerk , united states i believe it is about time that the eu put its foot down and told america " enough , it is our turn " .
with this whole idea of missile defence we are returning to the reagan era and i for one am not ready to put myself through this again .
it is time that the eu and gb tell america " thanks but no thanks " .
how long must we wait until the " world power " americans get to more important issues like aids and global warming ?
if the powers of this country ca n't stop a stupid dream , then i believe it is up to the eu to put its foot down and say " enough " .
pieter klerk , portland , oregon , united states as an american who voted for al gore , i am ashamed that we are now represented by such an idiot who stated that he did n't believe in global warming -lrb- now his own committee tells him differently . -rrb-
yes , europe can go it alone and should begin to exert its own will and america needs to learn a hard lesson that it has become an outsider in the " family of nations " .
we are so far behind on so many issues be it abortion , death penalty , environment , learning to work with rather than demanding always to be the leader .
only the europeans can gain backbone and stand together against the stubborn and arrogant attitude of this administration .
helen krishna , west chester , pa , usa thank god we have mr bush as president !
andrew -lrb- x brit -rrb- , usa thank god we have mr bush as president !
and i am happy to be on this side of the atlantic ocean .
the attitude of anyone who dislikes the usa is usually one of jealousy .
typical socialist attitude .
andrew -lrb- x brit -rrb- , greenville sc , usa " is america out of touch with the world ? "
what world - there 's something beyond our borders ?
paul komarek , pittsburgh , usa americans seem sick and tired of interfering in europe and i 'm sick and tired of it too .
the us government seems to think it has the right to act as the global police officer whilst europe dare n't wipe its own behind without permission from the us .
sure we need the us as an ally , and the us needs europe as an ally whether it believes that or not , but ca n't we just leave it at that ?
ian chapman , middlesbrough , uk i think it is wrong to impose the views of europe on the us zach nuebel , colorado , usa none of us would be here without the other .
america would have never existed without europe and europe very well could have fallen if it was not for america .
we are tied and whether you like it or not we 're very much alike .
however i think it is wrong to impose the views of europe on the us .
we can not dictate much that occurs in the eu and yet europe is supposed to have a free hand to do whatever you wish to america ?
the us is its own country with our own laws , customs , society , and beliefs .
you can not expect us to see eye to eye with you on everything .
nor can you demand that we halt a programme we 've already spent billions of dollars on .
the thought that it might spring a new arms race is true , but do you think we are not in one already ?
we have been for the last fifty years - just because it is n't on the surface does n't mean it 's not there .
so yes we could survive without each other , even do well for ourselves in the process .
but would it be preferable or even advisable ?
i think not .
zach nuebel , colorado , usa europe does not need america .
they may have needed help in the past but now they are in a position to stand up on their own feet .
but i do believe that if europe and america stand by each other in international disruptions then they have more chances of stopping a war .
catherine william , oxford , britain i regard the signs of differences between europeans and americans as a positive sign deryck bernard , guyana i regard the signs of differences between europeans and americans as a positive sign and a blessing to the world .
there is no benefit to civilisation from a unipolar world .
cultural diversity must manifest itself in lifestyle and political choices which emphasise those differences .
there has been a tendency for journalists and politicians to over-estimate the degree of dominance of global cultural values .
as someone who has lived in both cultures , it has always struck me that the differences in approach are profound and deep-seated .
as a citizen of the third world , i find the differences comforting .
deryck bernard , georgetown , guyana the only thing america is good for is the ' industry ' bush always refers to -lrb- frequently when defending his decision not to sign the kyoto agreement -rrb- - this means the few elite people who make a profit from such industry .
tamara , sydney , australia bush 's stance stems from nationalist paranoia , born of a lack of knowledge of , and any real interest in , matters outside of the usa .
whether the world likes it or not , the usa is the most powerful country , in economic and military terms and it must therefore take on the position of leader in those fields , together with that of counsellor , peace maker etc .
however , to do this satisfactorily that country needs an electoral system which ensures that its elected leaders get their positions not through simply the power of money and favour , but through a knowledge and sympathetic appreciation of things sometimes far removed from american domestic considerations .
roger griffiths , bristol , england americans have an enormous amount of goodwill towards other countries shane , usa -lrb- australian -rrb- americans have an enormous amount of goodwill towards other countries - if any of your listeners doubt this they should visit america to experience it themselves .
many america-bashers forget that world war ii , essentially a messy asian and european affair , created america as a superpower .
americans care as much about other countries as citizens of other countries care about most other countries - not much .
americans are interested in the rest of the world to the extent that they feel that other countries should become free and healthy democracies .
again , this is because americans care most about their own freedom and liberty within their own country .
shane , saint paul , usa -lrb- australian -rrb- " europe " will never be a military superpower .
most european nations spend less than 2 % of their gdp on defence , and that number is shrinking .
the united states is twenty or more years ahead of europe in military research .
the armies of europe are incapable of even defending themselves .
if the eu had tried to intervene in kosovo without u.s. help , the war would have ended with serbian troops marching through paris .
jeff , omaha , usa americans have no common purpose beyond their self-aggrandisement or accumulation of personal wealth james bluewolf , lakeport , usa as an american indian , i have to laugh when the topic of narrow mindedness is brought up , especially when hitler is mentioned .
spanish europeans , british , french and american invaders killed many more of our peoples on this soil than hitler ever dreamed of !
america is not great because of her political or economic systems but because she stole the richest lands on the face of the planet and proceeded to exploit the huge and broad-based resource .
she has succeeded in enriching a portion of her population by polluting the air , water and environment , and developing technologies without examining the consequences - while trying to convince the rest of the world of her moral integrity , while exporting consumerism , militaristic commitment and roller coaster technological development with an empty promise that it will bring the entire world a more peaceful , bountiful and fulfilling life .
james bluewolf , lakeport , usa i agree with andy , isle of man .
there seems to be a mix-up between anti-bush and anti-us .
dubya and his corporate friends are perceived by all right-thinking people , both in the us and in the rest of the planet , as being anti-world .
as he and his friends kneel and pray at the altar of the great god dollar , they do n't seem to care in the slightest about anything other than the accumulation of their own wealth .
please do n't confuse dubya and his all-consuming greed with the feelings of the vast majority of decent americans .
they feel equally horrified at his contempt for anything decent .
mark rees , california -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- the dream of " europe nation " will not work - too many deep-seated traditions , separate cultures , languages , and political differences .
in fact i see the usa has naturally formed the " euro / asia nation " as the immigrants and colonies from their mother countries learned to live and work together with the goal of forming a large free market economy which is rooted in english culture .
so does europe need usa ?
or does usa need uk , france , china , etc , etc ?
yes .
neil , atlanta , georgia i believe it is key that europe and the united states keep their relationship strong patrick cooper-mccann , mi , usa i think what some europeans may not understand is that even though president bush is in office , most americans disagree with at least a few points in his policy .
i myself personally disagree with his stance on the kyoto treaty and the death penalty among other things .
i believe it is key that europe and the united states keep their relationship strong and continue to grow together .
patrick cooper-mccann , hazel park , mi , usa if europe needs greed , corruption , global warming , and hatred ; then europe needs the us .
frankly though , it looks to me as if you have quite enough of your own .
david clifton , boulder co , usa europe not only looks much different but has different needs riz rahim , usa does europe need to be more independent of the us is perhaps a better and more pertinent question , since even minor powers with little to do with each other still have some level of inter-dependence in this day and age .
with the iron curtain gone , communism no longer a threat and russia reduced to an economic basket-case , europe not only looks much different but has different needs .
riz rahim , usa i dream of the day when america can bring our troops and politics back home .
leave european politics to the europeans ...
edward , central usa today , europe needs the us more than the us needs us .
however , tomorrow , soon , we will need each other , if only to counter-balance china 's huge powerhouse .
meanwhile , europe needs to build itself as a political and military power , and not just an economic one .
it also needs to quickly proceed with eu enlargement to fortify its eastern borders .
a reasonable dose of eu-us -lrb- constructive -rrb- criticisms will do no harm and help both sides find the optimum .
noel nicolas , london , uk regardless of whether the eu needs the us or not , this is our planet , everyone 's planet .
the us , by not agreeing to the kyoto treaty affects all of us .
sure other countries may have not agreed to it , but the us emits the largest amount of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere .
this arrogance of the us thinking that it knows what 's best for the rest of the world has to stop .
additionally , the president considering missile defence a higher priority than our planet , further demonstrates us aggression and its destructive ways .
dan , sydney firstly , i do n't consider myself european , and i do n't want anyone to say i am otherwise .
i consider myself british , and i think we , the british would do much better as the 51st american state , than as part of a failing europe with a failing currency .
it 's time to detach from europe , and stick with our american friends , who helped us many , many times , and could continue to do so for centuries to come .
andrew hannay , shrewsbury , uk george bush is not the demon he is being portrayed as ken w , tallahassee , florida , usa the anti-american vitriol and histrionics posted here are very disturbing .
i have concluded that this attitude is being fomented by " america haters " .
everyone should take a deep breath .
calm down , everything will be all right .
george bush is not the demon he is being portrayed as .
ken w , tallahassee , florida , usa the trouble is that while the present us administration is inward looking , it has key policy decisions that have made the world more unstable - kyoto , star wars , middle east .
they do not wish to take an active positive role in international affairs but make decisions that affects us all negatively .
francis stevens george , oslo , norway what is the point of this debate ?
europe is already the 51st state of the usa .
the usa earned this moral right to the territory on d-day .
they are just modest about mentioning it .
have a nice day ...
adrian m. shryane , uk i am not a fan of dubya , but i find the criticism of him by brits and europeans in general more than a bit disingenuous .
the abm treaty is based on the dubious mutually assured destruction -lrb- m.a.d. -rrb- theories of the 1960 's and should be challenged .
and as for kyoto , the brits and europe should put their money where their mouth is and ratify the doggoned thing , if they really believe it is n't seriously flawed .
i 'm sick and tired of the america bashing .
get a life out there , people !
all your anti-america drivel sounds like the rantings of a spoiled child who says , " i hate you " to daddy whenever you do n't get your way .
don truitt , panama city , florida , usa just because we 've been americanised in the past , does n't mean we have to stay that way arkady , tokyo , japan just because we 've been americanised in the past , does n't mean we have to stay that way .
europe and indeed most of the world , can do without their interference , especially when it comes to military power and hollywood films .
arkady , tokyo , japan regarding the issue of the importing of american culture , i think it is an issue of choice .
american films and music , even including the fast-food culture , thrive or fail by the number of people willing to spend money on them .
jeffrey curnoles , pennsylvania europe and the united states are of the same blood .
our relationship is so close that we should all be able to disagree , and then work toward togetherness .
we all love our culture and our children .
the distinction which sets us apart , will also bind us together .
let 's remember our common past , sacrifices and move forward together .
yes , we do need each other .
respect for each other must always be paramount .
i , as an american love my country .
i also respect europe .
boatsan , buffalo , usa i 'm in complete shock after reading the messages left by europeans about their feelings on the usa .
i now regret that even one american died protecting europe from nazism or communism .
we should have left you to your own devices .
charlie coffin , charlotte , nc , usa your comments during the programme not once did i encounter any negative comments about the united states or president bush eugene foster , chesterfield , va , usa i just returned from europe after visiting germany , france and ireland .
during this short trip , -lrb- 2 weeks -rrb- i talked to many people and not once did i encounter any negative comments about the united states or president bush .
i realise that two weeks is not much time to make an educated analysis of how europeans really feel about america .
europe should not be condemning president bush about kyoto , since not one single eu country has ratified the accord .
most people are not aware that the united states with only 5 % of the world 's population , produces 50 % of the world 's food supply .
eugene foster , chesterfield , va , usa i would love to see the us withdraw its troops from europe and be done with nato .
the cold war is over .
aside from importing oil , we should lower our world-wide profile and concentrate on internal policies .
dave holtz , indianapolis , usa esperanto died a death .
mandarin chinese is now the most spoken language in the world -lrb- due to china 's huge population -rrb- .
but english / american is still the most widely spoken .
how can europe effectively unite when no common language exists ?
when the un peacekeeping dirty work needs doing and the dust has settled from other nations backing out for whatever lame reason , who 's left standing there ?
the allies of the usa and uk .
1939 to 1945 may be a while ago , but not too far removed for some of us to remember who our real friends are .
english speaking nations should stick together .
darren -lrb- english -rrb- , usa i do n't think that we in the us have anything to apologise for arvind rao , new york , usa i do n't think that we in the us have anything to apologise for .
the " social problems " we 're criticised for are nothing compared to oldham , rostock or marseilles .
we are truly a multicultural society and while our lapses are well publicised , the racism here is nothing compared to britain , france , italy or germany .
i 'd be very happy to stop paying taxes to keep troops in europe .
arvind rao , new york , usa the united states and the eu have more in common , than they do differences .
it is important that they stay close and try to bring the rest of the world into harmony .
robert , london , england nick from boston refers to europe " bringing the us into line " .
bringing us in line with what , european values ?
hello , we 're not european !
we need each other from a trade perspective , nothing more .
if you want fireworks try to pressure us as austria was recently pressured for haider .
remember , there are two sides to every story .
thom , ohio , usa i was in gothenburg for the bush demonstration two days ago reidun heiene , oslo , norway i was in gothenburg for the bush demonstration two days ago .
i love both the us and european people -lrb- i lived both places -rrb- but we are witnessing our democracies being pulverised .
what we see is the removal of power from national and local level into the wto -lrb- which has a standing committee making sure that eu , nafta , apec and the other regional trade agreements obey wto -rrb- .
the system is driven by lobbying and secret negotiations ; it is destructive to the environment ; it increases poverty in both rich and poor countries .
reidun heiene , oslo , norway we should not be talking about a divorce just now , even though that attracts a lot of interest in the media .
europe can be patient for four years with an american president that most of us -lrb- here too -rrb- do n't want .
douglas bredahl , north fork , california in today 's world cutting ties is simply not possible .
europe needs the usa 's military might .
the usa needs the diplomatic clout of its european allies .
as for the supposed culture gap , the overall recent trend is that it is closing , not growing wider .
europe 's economy is becoming more like america 's free market system , and european style government programs have taken root in the us .
if europeans are truly dismayed over recent us actions , then the answer is to continue to engage them in dialogue .
cut ties with the us , and all your fears of us becoming a " rogue superpower " will come true .
david m gable , warsaw , in , usa america is such a huge place , though , it 's easy to get wrapped up in what 's going on in our own affairs david , chicago , usa believe it or not , there are americans who know what 's going on in the world and are sensitive to other cultures and politics .
america is such a huge place , though , it 's easy to get wrapped up in what 's going on in our own affairs and not be aware of what goes on in other parts of the world .
it 's also time to stop the name-calling and the whining .
we have more in common and share more values than not .
if you want things to be different , then get over yourselves and do something about it .
david , chicago , usa european intervention in the balkans only succeeded because of us air power .
many americans complain about having to act as the world 's policeman but i wonder if the " pax americana " came to an end whether americans would suffer the same crisis of identity that the british suffered when we had to give up our empire ?
i think europe has two options .
co-operation with the us or confrontation .
unfortunately i think there are forces at work within the eu determined to turn it into a super-power with the sole intention of confronting the us .
the danger of such a strategy can not be over estimated .
phil h , uk could someone please point out that more than one country has actually ratified the kyoto accords ?
i know there is one , but it is neither france , germany , the uk , spain , portugal or japan .
maybe the eu will be so kind as to ratify it first .
the eu and usa need each other , economically and militarily .
and there are n't exactly hordes of americans deciding to emigrate to the eu .
quite the opposite .
shaun s , denver , co , usa your comments before we went on air europe dwarfs the united states in terms of economy , exports and population rob holman , london , england europe dwarfs the united states in terms of economy , exports and population .
the military potential is vast , with the right level of investment .
also , europe is far more efficient and eco-friendly than the us .
i think there should now be international sanctions against the united states , until it reduces its output of greenhouse gases .
who needs the us ?
i think europe is fed up with being bullied , and is quite capable of standing up for itself .
rob holman , london , england of course europe needs the usa !
indeed the only thing that individual countries of the eu can agree on is their envious loathing of everything and anything american .
we are the cement that binds together this contrivance .
the eu only offers antithesis .
they are against this and contra that .
but when will the eu propose anything as a practical alternative other than the tired blandishments of discredited socialism and feel good " green " touchy feely stuff that has no practical benefit to anyone ?
if the eu is so keen on the kyoto treaty , then why is romania the only european country to ratify it ?
you hate us but still sit about whining and moaning , waiting for the usa to led .
grow up !
peter c. kohler , washington dc , usa bush needs to think before he acts .
his actions are those of a spoiled child .
gabriel vargas , mulege , mexico we see the eu as a great market place for us products and we seem to be in love with anything made in the eu .
i think the uk stands to profit greatly as the business link between the two .
i 'd buy some stock in that .
chris meadows , winston-salem nc , usa so far the eu has been reasonably effective at addressing the economic concerns of its member states david mellor , washington dc this debate is particularly ridiculous .
it is makes the initial flawed assumption that europe exists as a single unified entity .
there is as much contention and disagreement between national european leaders as there is between the nominal " euro " leadership and the us .
so far the eu has been reasonably effective at addressing the economic concerns of its member states .
however , it has proven ridiculously ineffective at even addressing basic security needs .
at some distant time in the future if " europe " as a unified entity comes in to existence , then the question of " does europe need the us ? " will possibly be a valid one .
david mellor , washington dc since bush took over , it 's as if we 've transported ourselves back in time about 50 years .
his policies are worrying and his abilities as a world leader are extremely questionable .
bring back clinton i say , at least he was harmless !
kate , london , uk europe is fuzzily defined and national pride will ultimately doom it to failure .
the usa is beset with social problems and likely to destroy itself from within .
i ca n't see that either can solve the other 's problems .
we can only , as we have been doing for so long , trade together for mutual benefit .
we must accept , i think , that the future belongs to china .
gary , uk turn your back on america to join the french and germans at your peril alex james , london , england turn your back on america to join the french and germans at your peril .
the uk has always had a special relationship with america , something of which the rest of europe has always been envious .
they would love to drag us into their melting pot of thinly veiled self-interest , infighting and bickering .
the uk must stand tall and hammer home the fact that we hold a unique position in the world at the centre of trading between america , europe and the commonwealth .
bush is bad news but he wo n't last and we must n't let his policies do any lasting damage to our relationship with america .
alex james , london , england i 'm from the czech republic and i want my country to become a member of the eu .
but i suppose that europe is n't unfortunately able to solve its own problems without us help - for example recent war in yugoslavian kosovo .
i think that european politicians have the ability to make things more complicated than necessary .
i ca n't understand why most of european politicians do n't agree with us plan to build new " sdi " .
the only thing that we -lrb- europeans -rrb- can do in the relationship to the usa is to criticise .
i think that europe ca n't refuse usa as its partner , because europe needs usa more than we 're able to realise -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- .
jan netopil , olomouc , czechia it is time for europe and asia to work together nick , boston , usa we should face facts - the us is an irresponsible , selfish and unreliable power .
it is time for europe to make the facts clear - that we should operate without american influence , and should create a better and more civilised global system .
it is time for europe and asia to work together , and to bring the us firmly into line .
nick , boston , usa with all this ' america ' bashing , it would be interesting to look into the future , of a world where the united states and europe were not allies .
please remember , the us has many natural resources at its disposal , and also has a very modern industrial / technological infrastructure .
compare that to europe , an over crowded landmass with limited natural resources .
if we are not allies , what side do you think could handle a direct conflict with a growing communist powerhouse similar to the ussr ?
mike , usa the eu and the un have the power to tell the us to ' take a hike ' if they so desire jim , new orleans , usa there are people in america who are sick of the united states taking the role of the ' world 's policeman ' .
many people do not realise that president clinton utilised the military more than any other president in history during peacetime .
the eu and the un have the power to tell the us to ' take a hike ' if they so desire .
i have heard from so many brits that the us is so much more than britain .
i really think that they need to take a good hard look at what the us is truly like .
while i love this country and all it stands for , there are many many problems at home which could be solved if we would worry more about what happens here in the us and less about what happens in the rest of the world .
jim , new orleans , usa as an american i sincerely apologise for george bush and his ignorance .
the european union keeping him from destroying the world is our only hope .
lori , usa america is merely suffering from the hangover of the last 50 years .
it is still clearly the only real superpower , a status which has been awarded over its huge economic and military growth since the 1950 's .
as such it has had the freedom to do as it chooses with this power .
just as critics were saying that the labour party had become arrogant with its majority , so the us became arrogant with its power .
the shift of power however , is changing .
the eu 's economy is at the same level as the us , and with the introduction of a european army , reliance on american military might will also reduce .
still , america has always been a friend to europe , this at least should not change .
mark stubbs , london europe also needs to understand that it is no longer the usa 's largest trading partner .
latin america is .
jerry , usa europe has been relatively peaceful for 56 years .
this is probably the longest peace in europe 's history , and europe can thank the usa for making it possible .
it is tiresome to hear the europeans talk of the dumb , unsophisticated americans who do n't know anything about diplomacy or politics when , left to their own devices , europeans really mucked up the world , and if it were not for america , would do it again .
europe also needs to understand that it is no longer the usa 's largest trading partner .
latin america is .
jerry bailey , fort worth , texas in america there an awful lot of people that are in favour of the death penalty , but against abortion .
in europe there are a lot of people that are pro abortion , but against the death penalty .
i fail to see what the problem is .
in america there a lot of people that want a first class military without getting involved in world affairs .
in europe there a lot of people that want to be involved in world affairs without the military muscle to back it up .
in america we have some of the most stringent environmental laws in the world , but a lot folks would like to get rid of them .
in europe you have a country that likes to nuke tropical islands while still pretending to be environmentally conscious , and lets not forget the country that still hunts whales .
what a merry bunch of ninnies ! ! ! !
mario t. majors , yokosuka , japan yes my european friends , go ahead and encourage the eu and the rest of the world to leave the usa behind .
perhaps 50 years from now when china is a superpower and indonesia is at the very least a threat to australia the eu will come to australia 's aid when its economic and political sovereignty is endangered .
yes cousins , you can be sure the belgians , greeks and danes will sail to australia 's -lrb- you can use a variety of scenarios as an example -rrb- aid in a time of crisis ...
craig , san jose , ca i am ashamed of those americans who write that we acted in ww2 only to help the europeans .
nonsense !
it was in our own interest to stop a fiend like hitler , and to stop the japanese aggression .
the main problem between us today is mr. bush and his cohorts , who got into office in a most peculiar way .
there will be a lot of pressure from americans themselves about his policies , and with both the europeans and americans disturbed about everything the administration here has in mind , everything should come out for the better .
keep up the criticism - we need your help. megan sweet , camp sherman , oregon just try cutting economic ties across the atlantic .
you could n't if you wanted to .
don , usa i laugh at much of the naiveté expressed on this question , which is moot but carefully phrased to inflame nationalistic fever .
you talk as if the world is still in the 19th century .
that would have been a more appropriate century for isolationist talk because it 's much too late now .
how much nationalistic integrity do you think your country has in this day and age of multi-national mega-corporations ?
when the ford corporation of america can continue to collect stock revenues from german companies during world war ii what chance do you think there is that any western nation is going to be allowed to cut off another .
you want to cause a world depression that will make the 1930 's look like a beach holiday ?
just try cutting economic ties across the atlantic .
you could n't if you wanted to .
as far as world leadership is concerned europe has their chance in macedonia right now .
bush is sick of that balkans mess so if the kla refuses to leave macedonia then europe can remove them themselves .
i 'm sure the kla will vacate when faced with europes ' internationally respected eu rapid deployment force armed with sputtering indignation .
don drakulich , usa europe should consider the fact that the us is pulling away from its european roots at an ever-increasing rate .
hispanic and asian emigration into the us will soon make the people of european extraction a minority group .
bush is right in not pandering to europe and increasing overtures toward mexico and latin america .
this group is currently the us largest trading partner and its importance will continue to increase .
peter cuneo , dix hills , usa the question implies europe is a power on equal footing with the us .
neither economically , not militarily , is this the case .
the uk would more likely petition to become the 51st state than leave nato , and we all know france is too scared of germany to trade nato protection for the eu .
as far as the us being out of touch with the rest of the world , this is simply not the case .
europeans are just out of touch with reality .
eric , seattle , usa i am an american student currently studying in japan .
the general european consensus seems to be that all americans are narrow-minded and unconcerned with the rest of the world .
if bush were to represent all of america , this would certainly be true .
however , when judging the american people , it is necessary to remember that half the population did not even vote for bush .
furthermore , numerous contacts with home have made it abundantly clear that the american youth detests bush and his policies .
sarah , toyohashi , japan this entire debate seems driven by an ill-justified sense of hysteria on both sides .
obviously , europe is hyper-aware of the us 's economic and military influence in the world .
at the same time , some europeans seem utterly ignorant of the unprecedented political , social , and cultural influence that europe wields throughout the world .
if european press and public opinion realized how influential europe has become , they might not be driven by insecurity to lash out at america in bitter , mean-spirited tones .
americans who have sacrificed much for europe might not feel ungratefully maligned .
and the whole vicious cycle of transatlantic name-calling might be avoided .
john senior , washington , dc , usa the united states is the biggest obstacle in europe 's approach towards asia t j won , seoul , south korea despite having all the conditions that make her every bit as equal , if not better , as the united states , europe 's unnecessary dependence and reliance on america is decreasing potential cooperation between the european union and the asian community .
as the dominant western power in the pacific region , the united states is the biggest obstacle in europe 's approach towards asia , and that will have devastating effect on europe 's economy and its influence on the world in the long run .
t j won , seoul , south korea the citizens of the european countries need to understand the impact of the division developing within the us .
the election says it all .
half the us people agree with the same european values and they want strong ties with europe .
mark , indianapolis , us the eu is becoming ever more powerful with its euro army and economic stability , the us is now close to recession i believe that president bush is worried the eu will be the next us .
james smith , uk as the usa seems always to come to the aid of europe , world war i , world war ii , cold war , balkans , it is difficult to imagine europe without us support .
perhaps we should ask when has europe ever helped the usa -lrb- or the uk for that matter -rrb- keith miles , london england europe needs the united states for its own political stability .
without the united states the europeans would soon be fighting wars among themselves as they have done for thousands of years .
our troops stationed there for over 50 years have presided over the longest peacetime is the history of europe .
this is not a coincidence .
the us can make it " alone " without europe , of course with some sacrifice .
however europe needs the us for its long-term political stability and financial survival .
my ancestors -lrb- hopkins -rrb- came over on the mayflower to escape to freedom .
millions of europeans followed .
you , europeans , built the united states .
we are your friends and distant relatives , appreciate what your ancestors created .
history shows they have saved you from yourselves time after time .
joe arko , plano , texas , u.s. having lived in the us and parts of europe , there is no doubt in my mind that most americans do not know what is going on in the world around them .
that is why it is difficult to understand why europe does not agree in many sensitive issues including global warming , abortion and arms .
much as europe needs america , america itself can not depend on itself for everything .
that is why it is necessary that george bush does not take a hard line in those issues that of interest to the rest of the world .
j k parlin , new jersey , usa remember half of us americans did not vote for bush .
marcus lloyd , usa what the rest of the world needs to remember is that the united states is a nation of many different people .
we do not all think of one accord and are not a giant mass of coca-cola guzzling people .
sure americans tend to be narrow-minded .
but remember half of us americans did not vote for bush in the election and as hard as it is to believe we do care about the rest of the world .
but in a nation so powerful only the voice of those currently in power will tend to be heard by the rest of the world .
sure europe needs america but it does n't have to be that way .
as all americans know we always look to europe for guidance even though we may not admit it marcus lloyd , tallahassee usa as an englishman staying in the us i have realised that yes , americans are ignorant of what goes on in much of the world , but in a country of this size they have no need to look overseas .
there are many problems within the us that needs tending too so it is understandable that at times the rest of the world comes second .
europe is all too ready to criticise the us when they try to control the world , and then attacks them again when they decide not to intervene .
unfortunately europe and especially the uk are reliant on the us for many things , economically and militarily and so it is something we have to accept for now .
a united europe will strengthen our position but this is a long way off , especially with the british resistance to european induction .
neal , mi , usa i find it amazing after reading so much negative , narrow-minded dribble from the europeans in this forum that they believe we americans are the ignorant lot .
so much talk , but no action .
the european 's desire to become a super-power seems to be based entirely upon jealousy of american influence and power .
stop talking and do something about it .
but of course europe is not really known for action .
that is our job .
europeans talk americans do .
that 's the difference and that 's why europe will always need the united states .
john t. , fl , usa naturally europe needs the economic might of the us to sustain our standard of life .
this goes without saying .
we need each other .
however , think of it this way .
if you were having a party , and the biggest , richest guy in the communal house decided to start setting fire to the furniture - everyone would agree that he should stop .
now imagine the big , rich guy stating ' i 'm personally having fun burning this furniture so i refuse to stop .
what would you think of this guy ?
that 's what europeans think of the american kyoto policy .
dave rawlinson , london , uk of course europe needs the u.s. !
the 20th century , with its two world conflicts -lrb- three if we take the cold war into account -rrb- will most likely be seen by future historians as the era against totalitarianism i.e. communism and fascism .
the u.s. played a major part in all these conflicts and tipped the scales in favour of parliamentary democracy paying a heavy price .
we must never forget that .
on the other hand , the nations of europe , with centuries of history on their backs , have a long way to go before they agree upon a collective foreign policy .
dimitris s. mentis , athens , greece leadership comes through moral high ground and ethics , not by economic leverage exerted on others norman , sanjose , costa rica it is high noon at the bush corral and time for us leadership to realize that their interests and rights stop where those of the rest of the world start .
leadership comes through moral high ground and ethics , not by economic leverage exerted on others .
true the us economy has been a major contributor to world economic growth .
only a dogmatic die-hard would argue that this is not so , but then again , there is a price for growth and it is plain wrong for the us to seek the achievement of its economic goals by ignoring the rest of the worlds interests .
the eu and the us need each other , those who claim otherwise are adopting foolish ethnocentric positions that are unrealistic ; just as it would be foolish for the us to believe that the rest of the world- and namely europe share and are committed to american values and priorities .
yes globalisation is not a two way street , but rather like a traffic circle : we either all drive in the same direction albeit- at different speeds - or risk not getting anywhere soon .
unfortunately washington believes that it is the rest of the world going the wrong way .
norman , sanjose , costa rica europe and the us do need each other in various ways .
however , the us has royally mishandled its role in the last decade .
it has put too much energy into carrying out a nonsensical campaign designed by tunnel-visioned american politicians , who unlike european politicians , have had absolutely no diplomatic training whatsoever .
intervention in europe without fully comprehending european issues , which include east and central europe as well as the eu , is absolutely absurd on the part of washington .
if washington reorganizes and educates itself and becomes sensitive to european needs , it would certainly be a valuable ally .
europe is more than just a geopolitical playground ; it 's home to 700 million people and thousands of years of civilization .
anna maria venetou , thessaloniki , greece europe is trying to assemble what america has had for more than two hundred years .
all policies aside , the eu needs to look inward and concentrate on it 's own problems .
i 'd be willing to bet that the new eu melting pot that is in its infancy is going to boil over before it even gets started , while the us continues to do what it has always done .
europeans will soon find that saving the environment , while important to a point , will quickly fade in importance when the unified economy is not providing the commoner population with basic happiness .
remember , fundamentally , the us is just a bunch people that migrated from the rest of the world motivated by a better life .
john a , upsate new york , usa bush is not the problem , u.s. arrogance is .
a people totally consumed by their life style and the money it takes to fund it .
america is the modern-times roman empire , seeing only itself when it comes to human rights , morals , justice and economy .
the time has come for the u.s to stop pushing its nose into every corner of the world , and to put an end to its coca colonization of the world .
america is more then a way of life , it 's a state of mind .
and it 's bad .
nimrod halpern , tel aviv , israel what our american friends need to realise is that globalisation does not infer americanisation lawrie elder , dubai the days of the us deciding european economic and military policy are over .
what our american friends need to realise is that globalisation does not infer americanisation .
a global economy and socio - political structure , demands that everyone changes its ways to reach majority consensus .
failure of the us to recognise this will hurt them a lot more than europe .
lawrie elder , dubai thank goodness that french president jacques chirac had the courage to stand up and say what other european leaders only mumble behind their hands : that president bush 's proposed nuclear missile defence system ' is a fantastic incitement to -lrb- nuclear -rrb- proliferation . '
in other words , bush is more concerned with stimulating the american economy through a massive escalation of military spending than through any meaningful strategy to stabilize world peace .
it is not by chance that general colin powell is constantly at his shoulder during this trip .
any way he might dress it up , bush is selling a return to the arms race on this trip , and most europeans simply do n't want it .
alix sharkey , paris , france i moved back from the u.s. to europe due mainly to the " culture vacuum " kambiz shahri , zurich , switzerland i have lived extensively in the u.s. and am an european .
the way i see it the 2 cultures complement each other : u.s. gung-honess offsets european " dithering " .
european cultural resistance , offsets american naiveté and uncouthness , when it comes to the rest of the world .
however , if only the europeans " believed " in themselves , then the u.s. would not factor as much in our psyche .
i moved back from the u.s. to europe due mainly to the " culture vacuum " .
do we need the u.s. ?
yes we do for practical reasons , but not at the cost of putting up with what is a precocious and spoilt culture .
kambiz shahri , zurich , switzerland i have to agree that the rash of anti-american sentiment i have seen here and elsewhere is really quite absurd .
certainly america has problems and flawed policies , but so does europe , and the rest of the world for that matter .
if you disagree with american actions or policies , state it , but do not insult the people .
i for one , would never dream of making a blanket insult directed at the people of europe .
additionally , please remember that several hundred thousand americans have died on european soil in the past hundred years , fighting against european tyrants .
america is not perfect , but no one else is either .

select a link below to watch talking point on air president george w bush has faced angry demonstrators during his first tour of europe since coming to the white house .
europeans are angry that the bush administration has turned its back on the kyoto treaty on tackling global warming and the russians are particularly fearful of the contentious us missile defence plans .
despite a huge volume of transatlantic trade and political co-operation between europe and america there is also a seemingly immense cultural divide .
on issues from defence and the environment to abortion and the death penalty , it seems there is a growing european rebellion against american values and culture .
can the gulf between the two western power blocks be bridged or is the transatlantic alliance coming to an end ?
is america now out of touch with the rest of the world ?
robin lustig was joined by tom reid from the washington post for talking point on air , a radio phone-in programme on bbc world service and bbc news online .
you can add to the debate by using the form below .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction your comments since the programme your comments during the programme your comments before the programme your comments since the programme it amazes me everyday that people around the globe still buy into the american theme of democracy .
bush has been appointed by the court .
we in america are now represented by a frightened man who wants to conduct his business behind closed doors .
it is a sad state of democracy , but it has long been this way .
and , look at his father , who continues his reign as the most powerful man in the world .
bush is more the puppet than even reagan .
please , understand this , and the fact that , yes , we americans could benefit from a more european point-of-view on the state of the world .
todd kearns , mancos , colorado , usa i have only read one comment from the usa on this subject , and find it typical .
it is all regarding europe not being a military super-power , claiming that the eu could not exist without the us !
only the usa is interested in being a military super-power !
despite what the uk government -lrb- the us ' lapdog , might i add -rrb- thinks , the rest of the eu in no way " needs " the usa , nor their interference in european affairs .
two thumbs up to france and germany for giving the two-fingered salute to george bush .
not all americans like this president , nor their government .
i am hoping to soon become an eu citizen myself .
phil jurament , boston usa millions of people have fled europe over the past several centuries , and we would do well to remember why l cacchio , missouri usa millions of people have fled europe over the past several centuries , and we would do well to remember why .
it was n't because europe offered too much freedom , or too much hope , or too much prosperity , or too few wars , or too much tolerance of divergent views .
on what basis can we say that the european world view in superior to the american ?
l cacchio , missouri usa i think that europe is plagued with arrogance .
europe needs america but america could easily survive without europe .
i spilled my blood in europe fighting in a regional conflict .
many of my close friends died on the beaches of france so that you could be free .
and yet you are still arrogant and feel higher than americans .
if it were not for america , right now britain would be a mere diocese of the third reich .
and after the war with the marshal plan and truman doctrine we rebuilt europe and americans sent their tax dollars over there to save you from communism .
we rebuilt your economies and our militaries protected you .
america has been there every step of the way to hold your hands and tell you its ok .
and now when your american made economies start to work you want to leave us in the dust .
you could not survive ten weeks without america .
tom lukens , illinois , usa the issue is not whether europe needs the u.s. or vice-versa .
it 's plainly obvious we need each other and should demand an even greater relationship from one another for the greater good of everyone .
the issue is rather , how does the u.s. develop a greater sense of global responsibility beyond its traditional role as military presence and treaty broker ?
and how do europeans develop a greater sense of self-reliance and become a greater force in persuading americans to be more internationally responsible ?
americans , as a manner of habit , are uncomfortable with government leading an active role in any large-scale project .
this is a major flaw and phobia in the american way of thinking .
americans like the idea of government as , at the most , a passive moderator , and not an active provider or regulator .
americans distrust government as being conscious and responsible , but rather usually see government as wasteful and self-serving .
ed nicholson , los angeles i 'm tired of the comments of my fellow disenchanted americans saying that they disagree with our president 's policy , so the eu needs to teach us a lesson .
the idea behind our country is that it is governed " by the people " , and the only reason that it feels like we do n't have control is that lazy , complacent americans let it get this way .
did you vote ?
only 4 out of 10 of us did in the last election .
if you want to make change , back it up with your actions .
it 's very easy to write to a congress person , it 's very easy to get to a voting booth .
do n't sit back and expect someone else to " punish " us with sanctions .
let 's not let is get that bad .
change is needed now , and all you have to do is vote in your local elections .
jeffrey mcdonald , san diego , ca , usa the eu needs the us more than the us needs the eu .
the business news just mentioned that if california were a nation , it had just passed france as being the fifth most productive " country " .
the population of california is 36m and france is 58m .
many parts of the eu have repressive tax rates and layers of unneeded of management that stifle business growth .
many eu businesses prefer to be in a lower tax country , such as ireland .
i would be in favour , subject to a mutual vote , of making the uk the 51st state and forget worrying about the rest of europe .
john king , eugene , oregon , usa i think that the european union needs the americans as well as the americans need the european union to exist .
dr victor , donetsk , ukraine i believe it is up to the eu to put its foot down and say " enough " pieter klerk , united states i believe it is about time that the eu put its foot down and told america " enough , it is our turn " .
with this whole idea of missile defence we are returning to the reagan era and i for one am not ready to put myself through this again .
it is time that the eu and gb tell america " thanks but no thanks " .
how long must we wait until the " world power " americans get to more important issues like aids and global warming ?
if the powers of this country ca n't stop a stupid dream , then i believe it is up to the eu to put its foot down and say " enough " .
pieter klerk , portland , oregon , united states as an american who voted for al gore , i am ashamed that we are now represented by such an idiot who stated that he did n't believe in global warming -lrb- now his own committee tells him differently . -rrb-
yes , europe can go it alone and should begin to exert its own will and america needs to learn a hard lesson that it has become an outsider in the " family of nations " .
we are so far behind on so many issues be it abortion , death penalty , environment , learning to work with rather than demanding always to be the leader .
only the europeans can gain backbone and stand together against the stubborn and arrogant attitude of this administration .
helen krishna , west chester , pa , usa thank god we have mr bush as president !
andrew -lrb- x brit -rrb- , usa thank god we have mr bush as president !
and i am happy to be on this side of the atlantic ocean .
the attitude of anyone who dislikes the usa is usually one of jealousy .
typical socialist attitude .
andrew -lrb- x brit -rrb- , greenville sc , usa " is america out of touch with the world ? "
what world - there 's something beyond our borders ?
paul komarek , pittsburgh , usa americans seem sick and tired of interfering in europe and i 'm sick and tired of it too .
the us government seems to think it has the right to act as the global police officer whilst europe dare n't wipe its own behind without permission from the us .
sure we need the us as an ally , and the us needs europe as an ally whether it believes that or not , but ca n't we just leave it at that ?
ian chapman , middlesbrough , uk i think it is wrong to impose the views of europe on the us zach nuebel , colorado , usa none of us would be here without the other .
america would have never existed without europe and europe very well could have fallen if it was not for america .
we are tied and whether you like it or not we 're very much alike .
however i think it is wrong to impose the views of europe on the us .
we can not dictate much that occurs in the eu and yet europe is supposed to have a free hand to do whatever you wish to america ?
the us is its own country with our own laws , customs , society , and beliefs .
you can not expect us to see eye to eye with you on everything .
nor can you demand that we halt a programme we 've already spent billions of dollars on .
the thought that it might spring a new arms race is true , but do you think we are not in one already ?
we have been for the last fifty years - just because it is n't on the surface does n't mean it 's not there .
so yes we could survive without each other , even do well for ourselves in the process .
but would it be preferable or even advisable ?
i think not .
zach nuebel , colorado , usa europe does not need america .
they may have needed help in the past but now they are in a position to stand up on their own feet .
but i do believe that if europe and america stand by each other in international disruptions then they have more chances of stopping a war .
catherine william , oxford , britain i regard the signs of differences between europeans and americans as a positive sign deryck bernard , guyana i regard the signs of differences between europeans and americans as a positive sign and a blessing to the world .
there is no benefit to civilisation from a unipolar world .
cultural diversity must manifest itself in lifestyle and political choices which emphasise those differences .
there has been a tendency for journalists and politicians to over-estimate the degree of dominance of global cultural values .
as someone who has lived in both cultures , it has always struck me that the differences in approach are profound and deep-seated .
as a citizen of the third world , i find the differences comforting .
deryck bernard , georgetown , guyana the only thing america is good for is the ' industry ' bush always refers to -lrb- frequently when defending his decision not to sign the kyoto agreement -rrb- - this means the few elite people who make a profit from such industry .
tamara , sydney , australia bush 's stance stems from nationalist paranoia , born of a lack of knowledge of , and any real interest in , matters outside of the usa .
whether the world likes it or not , the usa is the most powerful country , in economic and military terms and it must therefore take on the position of leader in those fields , together with that of counsellor , peace maker etc .
however , to do this satisfactorily that country needs an electoral system which ensures that its elected leaders get their positions not through simply the power of money and favour , but through a knowledge and sympathetic appreciation of things sometimes far removed from american domestic considerations .
roger griffiths , bristol , england americans have an enormous amount of goodwill towards other countries shane , usa -lrb- australian -rrb- americans have an enormous amount of goodwill towards other countries - if any of your listeners doubt this they should visit america to experience it themselves .
many america-bashers forget that world war ii , essentially a messy asian and european affair , created america as a superpower .
americans care as much about other countries as citizens of other countries care about most other countries - not much .
americans are interested in the rest of the world to the extent that they feel that other countries should become free and healthy democracies .
again , this is because americans care most about their own freedom and liberty within their own country .
shane , saint paul , usa -lrb- australian -rrb- " europe " will never be a military superpower .
most european nations spend less than 2 % of their gdp on defence , and that number is shrinking .
the united states is twenty or more years ahead of europe in military research .
the armies of europe are incapable of even defending themselves .
if the eu had tried to intervene in kosovo without u.s. help , the war would have ended with serbian troops marching through paris .
jeff , omaha , usa americans have no common purpose beyond their self-aggrandisement or accumulation of personal wealth james bluewolf , lakeport , usa as an american indian , i have to laugh when the topic of narrow mindedness is brought up , especially when hitler is mentioned .
spanish europeans , british , french and american invaders killed many more of our peoples on this soil than hitler ever dreamed of !
america is not great because of her political or economic systems but because she stole the richest lands on the face of the planet and proceeded to exploit the huge and broad-based resource .
she has succeeded in enriching a portion of her population by polluting the air , water and environment , and developing technologies without examining the consequences - while trying to convince the rest of the world of her moral integrity , while exporting consumerism , militaristic commitment and roller coaster technological development with an empty promise that it will bring the entire world a more peaceful , bountiful and fulfilling life .
james bluewolf , lakeport , usa i agree with andy , isle of man .
there seems to be a mix-up between anti-bush and anti-us .
dubya and his corporate friends are perceived by all right-thinking people , both in the us and in the rest of the planet , as being anti-world .
as he and his friends kneel and pray at the altar of the great god dollar , they do n't seem to care in the slightest about anything other than the accumulation of their own wealth .
please do n't confuse dubya and his all-consuming greed with the feelings of the vast majority of decent americans .
they feel equally horrified at his contempt for anything decent .
mark rees , california -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- the dream of " europe nation " will not work - too many deep-seated traditions , separate cultures , languages , and political differences .
in fact i see the usa has naturally formed the " euro / asia nation " as the immigrants and colonies from their mother countries learned to live and work together with the goal of forming a large free market economy which is rooted in english culture .
so does europe need usa ?
or does usa need uk , france , china , etc , etc ?
yes .
neil , atlanta , georgia i believe it is key that europe and the united states keep their relationship strong patrick cooper-mccann , mi , usa i think what some europeans may not understand is that even though president bush is in office , most americans disagree with at least a few points in his policy .
i myself personally disagree with his stance on the kyoto treaty and the death penalty among other things .
i believe it is key that europe and the united states keep their relationship strong and continue to grow together .
patrick cooper-mccann , hazel park , mi , usa if europe needs greed , corruption , global warming , and hatred ; then europe needs the us .
frankly though , it looks to me as if you have quite enough of your own .
david clifton , boulder co , usa europe not only looks much different but has different needs riz rahim , usa does europe need to be more independent of the us is perhaps a better and more pertinent question , since even minor powers with little to do with each other still have some level of inter-dependence in this day and age .
with the iron curtain gone , communism no longer a threat and russia reduced to an economic basket-case , europe not only looks much different but has different needs .
riz rahim , usa i dream of the day when america can bring our troops and politics back home .
leave european politics to the europeans ...
edward , central usa today , europe needs the us more than the us needs us .
however , tomorrow , soon , we will need each other , if only to counter-balance china 's huge powerhouse .
meanwhile , europe needs to build itself as a political and military power , and not just an economic one .
it also needs to quickly proceed with eu enlargement to fortify its eastern borders .
a reasonable dose of eu-us -lrb- constructive -rrb- criticisms will do no harm and help both sides find the optimum .
noel nicolas , london , uk regardless of whether the eu needs the us or not , this is our planet , everyone 's planet .
the us , by not agreeing to the kyoto treaty affects all of us .
sure other countries may have not agreed to it , but the us emits the largest amount of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere .
this arrogance of the us thinking that it knows what 's best for the rest of the world has to stop .
additionally , the president considering missile defence a higher priority than our planet , further demonstrates us aggression and its destructive ways .
dan , sydney firstly , i do n't consider myself european , and i do n't want anyone to say i am otherwise .
i consider myself british , and i think we , the british would do much better as the 51st american state , than as part of a failing europe with a failing currency .
it 's time to detach from europe , and stick with our american friends , who helped us many , many times , and could continue to do so for centuries to come .
andrew hannay , shrewsbury , uk george bush is not the demon he is being portrayed as ken w , tallahassee , florida , usa the anti-american vitriol and histrionics posted here are very disturbing .
i have concluded that this attitude is being fomented by " america haters " .
everyone should take a deep breath .
calm down , everything will be all right .
george bush is not the demon he is being portrayed as .
ken w , tallahassee , florida , usa the trouble is that while the present us administration is inward looking , it has key policy decisions that have made the world more unstable - kyoto , star wars , middle east .
they do not wish to take an active positive role in international affairs but make decisions that affects us all negatively .
francis stevens george , oslo , norway what is the point of this debate ?
europe is already the 51st state of the usa .
the usa earned this moral right to the territory on d-day .
they are just modest about mentioning it .
have a nice day ...
adrian m. shryane , uk i am not a fan of dubya , but i find the criticism of him by brits and europeans in general more than a bit disingenuous .
the abm treaty is based on the dubious mutually assured destruction -lrb- m.a.d. -rrb- theories of the 1960 's and should be challenged .
and as for kyoto , the brits and europe should put their money where their mouth is and ratify the doggoned thing , if they really believe it is n't seriously flawed .
i 'm sick and tired of the america bashing .
get a life out there , people !
all your anti-america drivel sounds like the rantings of a spoiled child who says , " i hate you " to daddy whenever you do n't get your way .
don truitt , panama city , florida , usa just because we 've been americanised in the past , does n't mean we have to stay that way arkady , tokyo , japan just because we 've been americanised in the past , does n't mean we have to stay that way .
europe and indeed most of the world , can do without their interference , especially when it comes to military power and hollywood films .
arkady , tokyo , japan regarding the issue of the importing of american culture , i think it is an issue of choice .
american films and music , even including the fast-food culture , thrive or fail by the number of people willing to spend money on them .
jeffrey curnoles , pennsylvania europe and the united states are of the same blood .
our relationship is so close that we should all be able to disagree , and then work toward togetherness .
we all love our culture and our children .
the distinction which sets us apart , will also bind us together .
let 's remember our common past , sacrifices and move forward together .
yes , we do need each other .
respect for each other must always be paramount .
i , as an american love my country .
i also respect europe .
boatsan , buffalo , usa i 'm in complete shock after reading the messages left by europeans about their feelings on the usa .
i now regret that even one american died protecting europe from nazism or communism .
we should have left you to your own devices .
charlie coffin , charlotte , nc , usa your comments during the programme not once did i encounter any negative comments about the united states or president bush eugene foster , chesterfield , va , usa i just returned from europe after visiting germany , france and ireland .
during this short trip , -lrb- 2 weeks -rrb- i talked to many people and not once did i encounter any negative comments about the united states or president bush .
i realise that two weeks is not much time to make an educated analysis of how europeans really feel about america .
europe should not be condemning president bush about kyoto , since not one single eu country has ratified the accord .
most people are not aware that the united states with only 5 % of the world 's population , produces 50 % of the world 's food supply .
eugene foster , chesterfield , va , usa i would love to see the us withdraw its troops from europe and be done with nato .
the cold war is over .
aside from importing oil , we should lower our world-wide profile and concentrate on internal policies .
dave holtz , indianapolis , usa esperanto died a death .
mandarin chinese is now the most spoken language in the world -lrb- due to china 's huge population -rrb- .
but english / american is still the most widely spoken .
how can europe effectively unite when no common language exists ?
when the un peacekeeping dirty work needs doing and the dust has settled from other nations backing out for whatever lame reason , who 's left standing there ?
the allies of the usa and uk .
1939 to 1945 may be a while ago , but not too far removed for some of us to remember who our real friends are .
english speaking nations should stick together .
darren -lrb- english -rrb- , usa i do n't think that we in the us have anything to apologise for arvind rao , new york , usa i do n't think that we in the us have anything to apologise for .
the " social problems " we 're criticised for are nothing compared to oldham , rostock or marseilles .
we are truly a multicultural society and while our lapses are well publicised , the racism here is nothing compared to britain , france , italy or germany .
i 'd be very happy to stop paying taxes to keep troops in europe .
arvind rao , new york , usa the united states and the eu have more in common , than they do differences .
it is important that they stay close and try to bring the rest of the world into harmony .
robert , london , england nick from boston refers to europe " bringing the us into line " .
bringing us in line with what , european values ?
hello , we 're not european !
we need each other from a trade perspective , nothing more .
if you want fireworks try to pressure us as austria was recently pressured for haider .
remember , there are two sides to every story .
thom , ohio , usa i was in gothenburg for the bush demonstration two days ago reidun heiene , oslo , norway i was in gothenburg for the bush demonstration two days ago .
i love both the us and european people -lrb- i lived both places -rrb- but we are witnessing our democracies being pulverised .
what we see is the removal of power from national and local level into the wto -lrb- which has a standing committee making sure that eu , nafta , apec and the other regional trade agreements obey wto -rrb- .
the system is driven by lobbying and secret negotiations ; it is destructive to the environment ; it increases poverty in both rich and poor countries .
reidun heiene , oslo , norway we should not be talking about a divorce just now , even though that attracts a lot of interest in the media .
europe can be patient for four years with an american president that most of us -lrb- here too -rrb- do n't want .
douglas bredahl , north fork , california in today 's world cutting ties is simply not possible .
europe needs the usa 's military might .
the usa needs the diplomatic clout of its european allies .
as for the supposed culture gap , the overall recent trend is that it is closing , not growing wider .
europe 's economy is becoming more like america 's free market system , and european style government programs have taken root in the us .
if europeans are truly dismayed over recent us actions , then the answer is to continue to engage them in dialogue .
cut ties with the us , and all your fears of us becoming a " rogue superpower " will come true .
david m gable , warsaw , in , usa america is such a huge place , though , it 's easy to get wrapped up in what 's going on in our own affairs david , chicago , usa believe it or not , there are americans who know what 's going on in the world and are sensitive to other cultures and politics .
america is such a huge place , though , it 's easy to get wrapped up in what 's going on in our own affairs and not be aware of what goes on in other parts of the world .
it 's also time to stop the name-calling and the whining .
we have more in common and share more values than not .
if you want things to be different , then get over yourselves and do something about it .
david , chicago , usa european intervention in the balkans only succeeded because of us air power .
many americans complain about having to act as the world 's policeman but i wonder if the " pax americana " came to an end whether americans would suffer the same crisis of identity that the british suffered when we had to give up our empire ?
i think europe has two options .
co-operation with the us or confrontation .
unfortunately i think there are forces at work within the eu determined to turn it into a super-power with the sole intention of confronting the us .
the danger of such a strategy can not be over estimated .
phil h , uk could someone please point out that more than one country has actually ratified the kyoto accords ?
i know there is one , but it is neither france , germany , the uk , spain , portugal or japan .
maybe the eu will be so kind as to ratify it first .
the eu and usa need each other , economically and militarily .
and there are n't exactly hordes of americans deciding to emigrate to the eu .
quite the opposite .
shaun s , denver , co , usa your comments before we went on air europe dwarfs the united states in terms of economy , exports and population rob holman , london , england europe dwarfs the united states in terms of economy , exports and population .
the military potential is vast , with the right level of investment .
also , europe is far more efficient and eco-friendly than the us .
i think there should now be international sanctions against the united states , until it reduces its output of greenhouse gases .
who needs the us ?
i think europe is fed up with being bullied , and is quite capable of standing up for itself .
rob holman , london , england of course europe needs the usa !
indeed the only thing that individual countries of the eu can agree on is their envious loathing of everything and anything american .
we are the cement that binds together this contrivance .
the eu only offers antithesis .
they are against this and contra that .
but when will the eu propose anything as a practical alternative other than the tired blandishments of discredited socialism and feel good " green " touchy feely stuff that has no practical benefit to anyone ?
if the eu is so keen on the kyoto treaty , then why is romania the only european country to ratify it ?
you hate us but still sit about whining and moaning , waiting for the usa to led .
grow up !
peter c. kohler , washington dc , usa bush needs to think before he acts .
his actions are those of a spoiled child .
gabriel vargas , mulege , mexico we see the eu as a great market place for us products and we seem to be in love with anything made in the eu .
i think the uk stands to profit greatly as the business link between the two .
i 'd buy some stock in that .
chris meadows , winston-salem nc , usa so far the eu has been reasonably effective at addressing the economic concerns of its member states david mellor , washington dc this debate is particularly ridiculous .
it is makes the initial flawed assumption that europe exists as a single unified entity .
there is as much contention and disagreement between national european leaders as there is between the nominal " euro " leadership and the us .
so far the eu has been reasonably effective at addressing the economic concerns of its member states .
however , it has proven ridiculously ineffective at even addressing basic security needs .
at some distant time in the future if " europe " as a unified entity comes in to existence , then the question of " does europe need the us ? " will possibly be a valid one .
david mellor , washington dc since bush took over , it 's as if we 've transported ourselves back in time about 50 years .
his policies are worrying and his abilities as a world leader are extremely questionable .
bring back clinton i say , at least he was harmless !
kate , london , uk europe is fuzzily defined and national pride will ultimately doom it to failure .
the usa is beset with social problems and likely to destroy itself from within .
i ca n't see that either can solve the other 's problems .
we can only , as we have been doing for so long , trade together for mutual benefit .
we must accept , i think , that the future belongs to china .
gary , uk turn your back on america to join the french and germans at your peril alex james , london , england turn your back on america to join the french and germans at your peril .
the uk has always had a special relationship with america , something of which the rest of europe has always been envious .
they would love to drag us into their melting pot of thinly veiled self-interest , infighting and bickering .
the uk must stand tall and hammer home the fact that we hold a unique position in the world at the centre of trading between america , europe and the commonwealth .
bush is bad news but he wo n't last and we must n't let his policies do any lasting damage to our relationship with america .
alex james , london , england i 'm from the czech republic and i want my country to become a member of the eu .
but i suppose that europe is n't unfortunately able to solve its own problems without us help - for example recent war in yugoslavian kosovo .
i think that european politicians have the ability to make things more complicated than necessary .
i ca n't understand why most of european politicians do n't agree with us plan to build new " sdi " .
the only thing that we -lrb- europeans -rrb- can do in the relationship to the usa is to criticise .
i think that europe ca n't refuse usa as its partner , because europe needs usa more than we 're able to realise -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- .
jan netopil , olomouc , czechia it is time for europe and asia to work together nick , boston , usa we should face facts - the us is an irresponsible , selfish and unreliable power .
it is time for europe to make the facts clear - that we should operate without american influence , and should create a better and more civilised global system .
it is time for europe and asia to work together , and to bring the us firmly into line .
nick , boston , usa with all this ' america ' bashing , it would be interesting to look into the future , of a world where the united states and europe were not allies .
please remember , the us has many natural resources at its disposal , and also has a very modern industrial / technological infrastructure .
compare that to europe , an over crowded landmass with limited natural resources .
if we are not allies , what side do you think could handle a direct conflict with a growing communist powerhouse similar to the ussr ?
mike , usa the eu and the un have the power to tell the us to ' take a hike ' if they so desire jim , new orleans , usa there are people in america who are sick of the united states taking the role of the ' world 's policeman ' .
many people do not realise that president clinton utilised the military more than any other president in history during peacetime .
the eu and the un have the power to tell the us to ' take a hike ' if they so desire .
i have heard from so many brits that the us is so much more than britain .
i really think that they need to take a good hard look at what the us is truly like .
while i love this country and all it stands for , there are many many problems at home which could be solved if we would worry more about what happens here in the us and less about what happens in the rest of the world .
jim , new orleans , usa as an american i sincerely apologise for george bush and his ignorance .
the european union keeping him from destroying the world is our only hope .
lori , usa america is merely suffering from the hangover of the last 50 years .
it is still clearly the only real superpower , a status which has been awarded over its huge economic and military growth since the 1950 's .
as such it has had the freedom to do as it chooses with this power .
just as critics were saying that the labour party had become arrogant with its majority , so the us became arrogant with its power .
the shift of power however , is changing .
the eu 's economy is at the same level as the us , and with the introduction of a european army , reliance on american military might will also reduce .
still , america has always been a friend to europe , this at least should not change .
mark stubbs , london europe also needs to understand that it is no longer the usa 's largest trading partner .
latin america is .
jerry , usa europe has been relatively peaceful for 56 years .
this is probably the longest peace in europe 's history , and europe can thank the usa for making it possible .
it is tiresome to hear the europeans talk of the dumb , unsophisticated americans who do n't know anything about diplomacy or politics when , left to their own devices , europeans really mucked up the world , and if it were not for america , would do it again .
europe also needs to understand that it is no longer the usa 's largest trading partner .
latin america is .
jerry bailey , fort worth , texas in america there an awful lot of people that are in favour of the death penalty , but against abortion .
in europe there are a lot of people that are pro abortion , but against the death penalty .
i fail to see what the problem is .
in america there a lot of people that want a first class military without getting involved in world affairs .
in europe there a lot of people that want to be involved in world affairs without the military muscle to back it up .
in america we have some of the most stringent environmental laws in the world , but a lot folks would like to get rid of them .
in europe you have a country that likes to nuke tropical islands while still pretending to be environmentally conscious , and lets not forget the country that still hunts whales .
what a merry bunch of ninnies ! ! ! !
mario t. majors , yokosuka , japan yes my european friends , go ahead and encourage the eu and the rest of the world to leave the usa behind .
perhaps 50 years from now when china is a superpower and indonesia is at the very least a threat to australia the eu will come to australia 's aid when its economic and political sovereignty is endangered .
yes cousins , you can be sure the belgians , greeks and danes will sail to australia 's -lrb- you can use a variety of scenarios as an example -rrb- aid in a time of crisis ...
craig , san jose , ca i am ashamed of those americans who write that we acted in ww2 only to help the europeans .
nonsense !
it was in our own interest to stop a fiend like hitler , and to stop the japanese aggression .
the main problem between us today is mr. bush and his cohorts , who got into office in a most peculiar way .
there will be a lot of pressure from americans themselves about his policies , and with both the europeans and americans disturbed about everything the administration here has in mind , everything should come out for the better .
keep up the criticism - we need your help. megan sweet , camp sherman , oregon just try cutting economic ties across the atlantic .
you could n't if you wanted to .
don , usa i laugh at much of the naiveté expressed on this question , which is moot but carefully phrased to inflame nationalistic fever .
you talk as if the world is still in the 19th century .
that would have been a more appropriate century for isolationist talk because it 's much too late now .
how much nationalistic integrity do you think your country has in this day and age of multi-national mega-corporations ?
when the ford corporation of america can continue to collect stock revenues from german companies during world war ii what chance do you think there is that any western nation is going to be allowed to cut off another .
you want to cause a world depression that will make the 1930 's look like a beach holiday ?
just try cutting economic ties across the atlantic .
you could n't if you wanted to .
as far as world leadership is concerned europe has their chance in macedonia right now .
bush is sick of that balkans mess so if the kla refuses to leave macedonia then europe can remove them themselves .
i 'm sure the kla will vacate when faced with europes ' internationally respected eu rapid deployment force armed with sputtering indignation .
don drakulich , usa europe should consider the fact that the us is pulling away from its european roots at an ever-increasing rate .
hispanic and asian emigration into the us will soon make the people of european extraction a minority group .
bush is right in not pandering to europe and increasing overtures toward mexico and latin america .
this group is currently the us largest trading partner and its importance will continue to increase .
peter cuneo , dix hills , usa the question implies europe is a power on equal footing with the us .
neither economically , not militarily , is this the case .
the uk would more likely petition to become the 51st state than leave nato , and we all know france is too scared of germany to trade nato protection for the eu .
as far as the us being out of touch with the rest of the world , this is simply not the case .
europeans are just out of touch with reality .
eric , seattle , usa i am an american student currently studying in japan .
the general european consensus seems to be that all americans are narrow-minded and unconcerned with the rest of the world .
if bush were to represent all of america , this would certainly be true .
however , when judging the american people , it is necessary to remember that half the population did not even vote for bush .
furthermore , numerous contacts with home have made it abundantly clear that the american youth detests bush and his policies .
sarah , toyohashi , japan this entire debate seems driven by an ill-justified sense of hysteria on both sides .
obviously , europe is hyper-aware of the us 's economic and military influence in the world .
at the same time , some europeans seem utterly ignorant of the unprecedented political , social , and cultural influence that europe wields throughout the world .
if european press and public opinion realized how influential europe has become , they might not be driven by insecurity to lash out at america in bitter , mean-spirited tones .
americans who have sacrificed much for europe might not feel ungratefully maligned .
and the whole vicious cycle of transatlantic name-calling might be avoided .
john senior , washington , dc , usa the united states is the biggest obstacle in europe 's approach towards asia t j won , seoul , south korea despite having all the conditions that make her every bit as equal , if not better , as the united states , europe 's unnecessary dependence and reliance on america is decreasing potential cooperation between the european union and the asian community .
as the dominant western power in the pacific region , the united states is the biggest obstacle in europe 's approach towards asia , and that will have devastating effect on europe 's economy and its influence on the world in the long run .
t j won , seoul , south korea the citizens of the european countries need to understand the impact of the division developing within the us .
the election says it all .
half the us people agree with the same european values and they want strong ties with europe .
mark , indianapolis , us the eu is becoming ever more powerful with its euro army and economic stability , the us is now close to recession i believe that president bush is worried the eu will be the next us .
james smith , uk as the usa seems always to come to the aid of europe , world war i , world war ii , cold war , balkans , it is difficult to imagine europe without us support .
perhaps we should ask when has europe ever helped the usa -lrb- or the uk for that matter -rrb- keith miles , london england europe needs the united states for its own political stability .
without the united states the europeans would soon be fighting wars among themselves as they have done for thousands of years .
our troops stationed there for over 50 years have presided over the longest peacetime is the history of europe .
this is not a coincidence .
the us can make it " alone " without europe , of course with some sacrifice .
however europe needs the us for its long-term political stability and financial survival .
my ancestors -lrb- hopkins -rrb- came over on the mayflower to escape to freedom .
millions of europeans followed .
you , europeans , built the united states .
we are your friends and distant relatives , appreciate what your ancestors created .
history shows they have saved you from yourselves time after time .
joe arko , plano , texas , u.s. having lived in the us and parts of europe , there is no doubt in my mind that most americans do not know what is going on in the world around them .
that is why it is difficult to understand why europe does not agree in many sensitive issues including global warming , abortion and arms .
much as europe needs america , america itself can not depend on itself for everything .
that is why it is necessary that george bush does not take a hard line in those issues that of interest to the rest of the world .
j k parlin , new jersey , usa remember half of us americans did not vote for bush .
marcus lloyd , usa what the rest of the world needs to remember is that the united states is a nation of many different people .
we do not all think of one accord and are not a giant mass of coca-cola guzzling people .
sure americans tend to be narrow-minded .
but remember half of us americans did not vote for bush in the election and as hard as it is to believe we do care about the rest of the world .
but in a nation so powerful only the voice of those currently in power will tend to be heard by the rest of the world .
sure europe needs america but it does n't have to be that way .
as all americans know we always look to europe for guidance even though we may not admit it marcus lloyd , tallahassee usa as an englishman staying in the us i have realised that yes , americans are ignorant of what goes on in much of the world , but in a country of this size they have no need to look overseas .
there are many problems within the us that needs tending too so it is understandable that at times the rest of the world comes second .
europe is all too ready to criticise the us when they try to control the world , and then attacks them again when they decide not to intervene .
unfortunately europe and especially the uk are reliant on the us for many things , economically and militarily and so it is something we have to accept for now .
a united europe will strengthen our position but this is a long way off , especially with the british resistance to european induction .
neal , mi , usa i find it amazing after reading so much negative , narrow-minded dribble from the europeans in this forum that they believe we americans are the ignorant lot .
so much talk , but no action .
the european 's desire to become a super-power seems to be based entirely upon jealousy of american influence and power .
stop talking and do something about it .
but of course europe is not really known for action .
that is our job .
europeans talk americans do .
that 's the difference and that 's why europe will always need the united states .
john t. , fl , usa naturally europe needs the economic might of the us to sustain our standard of life .
this goes without saying .
we need each other .
however , think of it this way .
if you were having a party , and the biggest , richest guy in the communal house decided to start setting fire to the furniture - everyone would agree that he should stop .
now imagine the big , rich guy stating ' i 'm personally having fun burning this furniture so i refuse to stop .
what would you think of this guy ?
that 's what europeans think of the american kyoto policy .
dave rawlinson , london , uk of course europe needs the u.s. !
the 20th century , with its two world conflicts -lrb- three if we take the cold war into account -rrb- will most likely be seen by future historians as the era against totalitarianism i.e. communism and fascism .
the u.s. played a major part in all these conflicts and tipped the scales in favour of parliamentary democracy paying a heavy price .
we must never forget that .
on the other hand , the nations of europe , with centuries of history on their backs , have a long way to go before they agree upon a collective foreign policy .
dimitris s. mentis , athens , greece leadership comes through moral high ground and ethics , not by economic leverage exerted on others norman , sanjose , costa rica it is high noon at the bush corral and time for us leadership to realize that their interests and rights stop where those of the rest of the world start .
leadership comes through moral high ground and ethics , not by economic leverage exerted on others .
true the us economy has been a major contributor to world economic growth .
only a dogmatic die-hard would argue that this is not so , but then again , there is a price for growth and it is plain wrong for the us to seek the achievement of its economic goals by ignoring the rest of the worlds interests .
the eu and the us need each other , those who claim otherwise are adopting foolish ethnocentric positions that are unrealistic ; just as it would be foolish for the us to believe that the rest of the world- and namely europe share and are committed to american values and priorities .
yes globalisation is not a two way street , but rather like a traffic circle : we either all drive in the same direction albeit- at different speeds - or risk not getting anywhere soon .
unfortunately washington believes that it is the rest of the world going the wrong way .
norman , sanjose , costa rica europe and the us do need each other in various ways .
however , the us has royally mishandled its role in the last decade .
it has put too much energy into carrying out a nonsensical campaign designed by tunnel-visioned american politicians , who unlike european politicians , have had absolutely no diplomatic training whatsoever .
intervention in europe without fully comprehending european issues , which include east and central europe as well as the eu , is absolutely absurd on the part of washington .
if washington reorganizes and educates itself and becomes sensitive to european needs , it would certainly be a valuable ally .
europe is more than just a geopolitical playground ; it 's home to 700 million people and thousands of years of civilization .
anna maria venetou , thessaloniki , greece europe is trying to assemble what america has had for more than two hundred years .
all policies aside , the eu needs to look inward and concentrate on it 's own problems .
i 'd be willing to bet that the new eu melting pot that is in its infancy is going to boil over before it even gets started , while the us continues to do what it has always done .
europeans will soon find that saving the environment , while important to a point , will quickly fade in importance when the unified economy is not providing the commoner population with basic happiness .
remember , fundamentally , the us is just a bunch people that migrated from the rest of the world motivated by a better life .
john a , upsate new york , usa bush is not the problem , u.s. arrogance is .
a people totally consumed by their life style and the money it takes to fund it .
america is the modern-times roman empire , seeing only itself when it comes to human rights , morals , justice and economy .
the time has come for the u.s to stop pushing its nose into every corner of the world , and to put an end to its coca colonization of the world .
america is more then a way of life , it 's a state of mind .
and it 's bad .
nimrod halpern , tel aviv , israel what our american friends need to realise is that globalisation does not infer americanisation lawrie elder , dubai the days of the us deciding european economic and military policy are over .
what our american friends need to realise is that globalisation does not infer americanisation .
a global economy and socio - political structure , demands that everyone changes its ways to reach majority consensus .
failure of the us to recognise this will hurt them a lot more than europe .
lawrie elder , dubai thank goodness that french president jacques chirac had the courage to stand up and say what other european leaders only mumble behind their hands : that president bush 's proposed nuclear missile defence system ' is a fantastic incitement to -lrb- nuclear -rrb- proliferation . '
in other words , bush is more concerned with stimulating the american economy through a massive escalation of military spending than through any meaningful strategy to stabilize world peace .
it is not by chance that general colin powell is constantly at his shoulder during this trip .
any way he might dress it up , bush is selling a return to the arms race on this trip , and most europeans simply do n't want it .
alix sharkey , paris , france i moved back from the u.s. to europe due mainly to the " culture vacuum " kambiz shahri , zurich , switzerland i have lived extensively in the u.s. and am an european .
the way i see it the 2 cultures complement each other : u.s. gung-honess offsets european " dithering " .
european cultural resistance , offsets american naiveté and uncouthness , when it comes to the rest of the world .
however , if only the europeans " believed " in themselves , then the u.s. would not factor as much in our psyche .
i moved back from the u.s. to europe due mainly to the " culture vacuum " .
do we need the u.s. ?
yes we do for practical reasons , but not at the cost of putting up with what is a precocious and spoilt culture .
kambiz shahri , zurich , switzerland i have to agree that the rash of anti-american sentiment i have seen here and elsewhere is really quite absurd .
certainly america has problems and flawed policies , but so does europe , and the rest of the world for that matter .
if you disagree with american actions or policies , state it , but do not insult the people .
i for one , would never dream of making a blanket insult directed at the people of europe .
additionally , please remember that several hundred thousand americans have died on european soil in the past hundred years , fighting against european tyrants .
america is not perfect , but no one else is either .

select a link below to watch talking point on air president george w bush has faced angry demonstrators during his first tour of europe since coming to the white house .
europeans are angry that the bush administration has turned its back on the kyoto treaty on tackling global warming and the russians are particularly fearful of the contentious us missile defence plans .
despite a huge volume of transatlantic trade and political co-operation between europe and america there is also a seemingly immense cultural divide .
on issues from defence and the environment to abortion and the death penalty , it seems there is a growing european rebellion against american values and culture .
can the gulf between the two western power blocks be bridged or is the transatlantic alliance coming to an end ?
is america now out of touch with the rest of the world ?
robin lustig was joined by tom reid from the washington post for talking point on air , a radio phone-in programme on bbc world service and bbc news online .
you can add to the debate by using the form below .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction your comments since the programme your comments during the programme your comments before the programme your comments since the programme it amazes me everyday that people around the globe still buy into the american theme of democracy .
bush has been appointed by the court .
we in america are now represented by a frightened man who wants to conduct his business behind closed doors .
it is a sad state of democracy , but it has long been this way .
and , look at his father , who continues his reign as the most powerful man in the world .
bush is more the puppet than even reagan .
please , understand this , and the fact that , yes , we americans could benefit from a more european point-of-view on the state of the world .
todd kearns , mancos , colorado , usa i have only read one comment from the usa on this subject , and find it typical .
it is all regarding europe not being a military super-power , claiming that the eu could not exist without the us !
only the usa is interested in being a military super-power !
despite what the uk government -lrb- the us ' lapdog , might i add -rrb- thinks , the rest of the eu in no way " needs " the usa , nor their interference in european affairs .
two thumbs up to france and germany for giving the two-fingered salute to george bush .
not all americans like this president , nor their government .
i am hoping to soon become an eu citizen myself .
phil jurament , boston usa millions of people have fled europe over the past several centuries , and we would do well to remember why l cacchio , missouri usa millions of people have fled europe over the past several centuries , and we would do well to remember why .
it was n't because europe offered too much freedom , or too much hope , or too much prosperity , or too few wars , or too much tolerance of divergent views .
on what basis can we say that the european world view in superior to the american ?
l cacchio , missouri usa i think that europe is plagued with arrogance .
europe needs america but america could easily survive without europe .
i spilled my blood in europe fighting in a regional conflict .
many of my close friends died on the beaches of france so that you could be free .
and yet you are still arrogant and feel higher than americans .
if it were not for america , right now britain would be a mere diocese of the third reich .
and after the war with the marshal plan and truman doctrine we rebuilt europe and americans sent their tax dollars over there to save you from communism .
we rebuilt your economies and our militaries protected you .
america has been there every step of the way to hold your hands and tell you its ok .
and now when your american made economies start to work you want to leave us in the dust .
you could not survive ten weeks without america .
tom lukens , illinois , usa the issue is not whether europe needs the u.s. or vice-versa .
it 's plainly obvious we need each other and should demand an even greater relationship from one another for the greater good of everyone .
the issue is rather , how does the u.s. develop a greater sense of global responsibility beyond its traditional role as military presence and treaty broker ?
and how do europeans develop a greater sense of self-reliance and become a greater force in persuading americans to be more internationally responsible ?
americans , as a manner of habit , are uncomfortable with government leading an active role in any large-scale project .
this is a major flaw and phobia in the american way of thinking .
americans like the idea of government as , at the most , a passive moderator , and not an active provider or regulator .
americans distrust government as being conscious and responsible , but rather usually see government as wasteful and self-serving .
ed nicholson , los angeles i 'm tired of the comments of my fellow disenchanted americans saying that they disagree with our president 's policy , so the eu needs to teach us a lesson .
the idea behind our country is that it is governed " by the people " , and the only reason that it feels like we do n't have control is that lazy , complacent americans let it get this way .
did you vote ?
only 4 out of 10 of us did in the last election .
if you want to make change , back it up with your actions .
it 's very easy to write to a congress person , it 's very easy to get to a voting booth .
do n't sit back and expect someone else to " punish " us with sanctions .
let 's not let is get that bad .
change is needed now , and all you have to do is vote in your local elections .
jeffrey mcdonald , san diego , ca , usa the eu needs the us more than the us needs the eu .
the business news just mentioned that if california were a nation , it had just passed france as being the fifth most productive " country " .
the population of california is 36m and france is 58m .
many parts of the eu have repressive tax rates and layers of unneeded of management that stifle business growth .
many eu businesses prefer to be in a lower tax country , such as ireland .
i would be in favour , subject to a mutual vote , of making the uk the 51st state and forget worrying about the rest of europe .
john king , eugene , oregon , usa i think that the european union needs the americans as well as the americans need the european union to exist .
dr victor , donetsk , ukraine i believe it is up to the eu to put its foot down and say " enough " pieter klerk , united states i believe it is about time that the eu put its foot down and told america " enough , it is our turn " .
with this whole idea of missile defence we are returning to the reagan era and i for one am not ready to put myself through this again .
it is time that the eu and gb tell america " thanks but no thanks " .
how long must we wait until the " world power " americans get to more important issues like aids and global warming ?
if the powers of this country ca n't stop a stupid dream , then i believe it is up to the eu to put its foot down and say " enough " .
pieter klerk , portland , oregon , united states as an american who voted for al gore , i am ashamed that we are now represented by such an idiot who stated that he did n't believe in global warming -lrb- now his own committee tells him differently . -rrb-
yes , europe can go it alone and should begin to exert its own will and america needs to learn a hard lesson that it has become an outsider in the " family of nations " .
we are so far behind on so many issues be it abortion , death penalty , environment , learning to work with rather than demanding always to be the leader .
only the europeans can gain backbone and stand together against the stubborn and arrogant attitude of this administration .
helen krishna , west chester , pa , usa thank god we have mr bush as president !
andrew -lrb- x brit -rrb- , usa thank god we have mr bush as president !
and i am happy to be on this side of the atlantic ocean .
the attitude of anyone who dislikes the usa is usually one of jealousy .
typical socialist attitude .
andrew -lrb- x brit -rrb- , greenville sc , usa " is america out of touch with the world ? "
what world - there 's something beyond our borders ?
paul komarek , pittsburgh , usa americans seem sick and tired of interfering in europe and i 'm sick and tired of it too .
the us government seems to think it has the right to act as the global police officer whilst europe dare n't wipe its own behind without permission from the us .
sure we need the us as an ally , and the us needs europe as an ally whether it believes that or not , but ca n't we just leave it at that ?
ian chapman , middlesbrough , uk i think it is wrong to impose the views of europe on the us zach nuebel , colorado , usa none of us would be here without the other .
america would have never existed without europe and europe very well could have fallen if it was not for america .
we are tied and whether you like it or not we 're very much alike .
however i think it is wrong to impose the views of europe on the us .
we can not dictate much that occurs in the eu and yet europe is supposed to have a free hand to do whatever you wish to america ?
the us is its own country with our own laws , customs , society , and beliefs .
you can not expect us to see eye to eye with you on everything .
nor can you demand that we halt a programme we 've already spent billions of dollars on .
the thought that it might spring a new arms race is true , but do you think we are not in one already ?
we have been for the last fifty years - just because it is n't on the surface does n't mean it 's not there .
so yes we could survive without each other , even do well for ourselves in the process .
but would it be preferable or even advisable ?
i think not .
zach nuebel , colorado , usa europe does not need america .
they may have needed help in the past but now they are in a position to stand up on their own feet .
but i do believe that if europe and america stand by each other in international disruptions then they have more chances of stopping a war .
catherine william , oxford , britain i regard the signs of differences between europeans and americans as a positive sign deryck bernard , guyana i regard the signs of differences between europeans and americans as a positive sign and a blessing to the world .
there is no benefit to civilisation from a unipolar world .
cultural diversity must manifest itself in lifestyle and political choices which emphasise those differences .
there has been a tendency for journalists and politicians to over-estimate the degree of dominance of global cultural values .
as someone who has lived in both cultures , it has always struck me that the differences in approach are profound and deep-seated .
as a citizen of the third world , i find the differences comforting .
deryck bernard , georgetown , guyana the only thing america is good for is the ' industry ' bush always refers to -lrb- frequently when defending his decision not to sign the kyoto agreement -rrb- - this means the few elite people who make a profit from such industry .
tamara , sydney , australia bush 's stance stems from nationalist paranoia , born of a lack of knowledge of , and any real interest in , matters outside of the usa .
whether the world likes it or not , the usa is the most powerful country , in economic and military terms and it must therefore take on the position of leader in those fields , together with that of counsellor , peace maker etc .
however , to do this satisfactorily that country needs an electoral system which ensures that its elected leaders get their positions not through simply the power of money and favour , but through a knowledge and sympathetic appreciation of things sometimes far removed from american domestic considerations .
roger griffiths , bristol , england americans have an enormous amount of goodwill towards other countries shane , usa -lrb- australian -rrb- americans have an enormous amount of goodwill towards other countries - if any of your listeners doubt this they should visit america to experience it themselves .
many america-bashers forget that world war ii , essentially a messy asian and european affair , created america as a superpower .
americans care as much about other countries as citizens of other countries care about most other countries - not much .
americans are interested in the rest of the world to the extent that they feel that other countries should become free and healthy democracies .
again , this is because americans care most about their own freedom and liberty within their own country .
shane , saint paul , usa -lrb- australian -rrb- " europe " will never be a military superpower .
most european nations spend less than 2 % of their gdp on defence , and that number is shrinking .
the united states is twenty or more years ahead of europe in military research .
the armies of europe are incapable of even defending themselves .
if the eu had tried to intervene in kosovo without u.s. help , the war would have ended with serbian troops marching through paris .
jeff , omaha , usa americans have no common purpose beyond their self-aggrandisement or accumulation of personal wealth james bluewolf , lakeport , usa as an american indian , i have to laugh when the topic of narrow mindedness is brought up , especially when hitler is mentioned .
spanish europeans , british , french and american invaders killed many more of our peoples on this soil than hitler ever dreamed of !
america is not great because of her political or economic systems but because she stole the richest lands on the face of the planet and proceeded to exploit the huge and broad-based resource .
she has succeeded in enriching a portion of her population by polluting the air , water and environment , and developing technologies without examining the consequences - while trying to convince the rest of the world of her moral integrity , while exporting consumerism , militaristic commitment and roller coaster technological development with an empty promise that it will bring the entire world a more peaceful , bountiful and fulfilling life .
james bluewolf , lakeport , usa i agree with andy , isle of man .
there seems to be a mix-up between anti-bush and anti-us .
dubya and his corporate friends are perceived by all right-thinking people , both in the us and in the rest of the planet , as being anti-world .
as he and his friends kneel and pray at the altar of the great god dollar , they do n't seem to care in the slightest about anything other than the accumulation of their own wealth .
please do n't confuse dubya and his all-consuming greed with the feelings of the vast majority of decent americans .
they feel equally horrified at his contempt for anything decent .
mark rees , california -lrb- ex-pat -rrb- the dream of " europe nation " will not work - too many deep-seated traditions , separate cultures , languages , and political differences .
in fact i see the usa has naturally formed the " euro / asia nation " as the immigrants and colonies from their mother countries learned to live and work together with the goal of forming a large free market economy which is rooted in english culture .
so does europe need usa ?
or does usa need uk , france , china , etc , etc ?
yes .
neil , atlanta , georgia i believe it is key that europe and the united states keep their relationship strong patrick cooper-mccann , mi , usa i think what some europeans may not understand is that even though president bush is in office , most americans disagree with at least a few points in his policy .
i myself personally disagree with his stance on the kyoto treaty and the death penalty among other things .
i believe it is key that europe and the united states keep their relationship strong and continue to grow together .
patrick cooper-mccann , hazel park , mi , usa if europe needs greed , corruption , global warming , and hatred ; then europe needs the us .
frankly though , it looks to me as if you have quite enough of your own .
david clifton , boulder co , usa europe not only looks much different but has different needs riz rahim , usa does europe need to be more independent of the us is perhaps a better and more pertinent question , since even minor powers with little to do with each other still have some level of inter-dependence in this day and age .
with the iron curtain gone , communism no longer a threat and russia reduced to an economic basket-case , europe not only looks much different but has different needs .
riz rahim , usa i dream of the day when america can bring our troops and politics back home .
leave european politics to the europeans ...
edward , central usa today , europe needs the us more than the us needs us .
however , tomorrow , soon , we will need each other , if only to counter-balance china 's huge powerhouse .
meanwhile , europe needs to build itself as a political and military power , and not just an economic one .
it also needs to quickly proceed with eu enlargement to fortify its eastern borders .
a reasonable dose of eu-us -lrb- constructive -rrb- criticisms will do no harm and help both sides find the optimum .
noel nicolas , london , uk regardless of whether the eu needs the us or not , this is our planet , everyone 's planet .
the us , by not agreeing to the kyoto treaty affects all of us .
sure other countries may have not agreed to it , but the us emits the largest amount of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere .
this arrogance of the us thinking that it knows what 's best for the rest of the world has to stop .
additionally , the president considering missile defence a higher priority than our planet , further demonstrates us aggression and its destructive ways .
dan , sydney firstly , i do n't consider myself european , and i do n't want anyone to say i am otherwise .
i consider myself british , and i think we , the british would do much better as the 51st american state , than as part of a failing europe with a failing currency .
it 's time to detach from europe , and stick with our american friends , who helped us many , many times , and could continue to do so for centuries to come .
andrew hannay , shrewsbury , uk george bush is not the demon he is being portrayed as ken w , tallahassee , florida , usa the anti-american vitriol and histrionics posted here are very disturbing .
i have concluded that this attitude is being fomented by " america haters " .
everyone should take a deep breath .
calm down , everything will be all right .
george bush is not the demon he is being portrayed as .
ken w , tallahassee , florida , usa the trouble is that while the present us administration is inward looking , it has key policy decisions that have made the world more unstable - kyoto , star wars , middle east .
they do not wish to take an active positive role in international affairs but make decisions that affects us all negatively .
francis stevens george , oslo , norway what is the point of this debate ?
europe is already the 51st state of the usa .
the usa earned this moral right to the territory on d-day .
they are just modest about mentioning it .
have a nice day ...
adrian m. shryane , uk i am not a fan of dubya , but i find the criticism of him by brits and europeans in general more than a bit disingenuous .
the abm treaty is based on the dubious mutually assured destruction -lrb- m.a.d. -rrb- theories of the 1960 's and should be challenged .
and as for kyoto , the brits and europe should put their money where their mouth is and ratify the doggoned thing , if they really believe it is n't seriously flawed .
i 'm sick and tired of the america bashing .
get a life out there , people !
all your anti-america drivel sounds like the rantings of a spoiled child who says , " i hate you " to daddy whenever you do n't get your way .
don truitt , panama city , florida , usa just because we 've been americanised in the past , does n't mean we have to stay that way arkady , tokyo , japan just because we 've been americanised in the past , does n't mean we have to stay that way .
europe and indeed most of the world , can do without their interference , especially when it comes to military power and hollywood films .
arkady , tokyo , japan regarding the issue of the importing of american culture , i think it is an issue of choice .
american films and music , even including the fast-food culture , thrive or fail by the number of people willing to spend money on them .
jeffrey curnoles , pennsylvania europe and the united states are of the same blood .
our relationship is so close that we should all be able to disagree , and then work toward togetherness .
we all love our culture and our children .
the distinction which sets us apart , will also bind us together .
let 's remember our common past , sacrifices and move forward together .
yes , we do need each other .
respect for each other must always be paramount .
i , as an american love my country .
i also respect europe .
boatsan , buffalo , usa i 'm in complete shock after reading the messages left by europeans about their feelings on the usa .
i now regret that even one american died protecting europe from nazism or communism .
we should have left you to your own devices .
charlie coffin , charlotte , nc , usa your comments during the programme not once did i encounter any negative comments about the united states or president bush eugene foster , chesterfield , va , usa i just returned from europe after visiting germany , france and ireland .
during this short trip , -lrb- 2 weeks -rrb- i talked to many people and not once did i encounter any negative comments about the united states or president bush .
i realise that two weeks is not much time to make an educated analysis of how europeans really feel about america .
europe should not be condemning president bush about kyoto , since not one single eu country has ratified the accord .
most people are not aware that the united states with only 5 % of the world 's population , produces 50 % of the world 's food supply .
eugene foster , chesterfield , va , usa i would love to see the us withdraw its troops from europe and be done with nato .
the cold war is over .
aside from importing oil , we should lower our world-wide profile and concentrate on internal policies .
dave holtz , indianapolis , usa esperanto died a death .
mandarin chinese is now the most spoken language in the world -lrb- due to china 's huge population -rrb- .
but english / american is still the most widely spoken .
how can europe effectively unite when no common language exists ?
when the un peacekeeping dirty work needs doing and the dust has settled from other nations backing out for whatever lame reason , who 's left standing there ?
the allies of the usa and uk .
1939 to 1945 may be a while ago , but not too far removed for some of us to remember who our real friends are .
english speaking nations should stick together .
darren -lrb- english -rrb- , usa i do n't think that we in the us have anything to apologise for arvind rao , new york , usa i do n't think that we in the us have anything to apologise for .
the " social problems " we 're criticised for are nothing compared to oldham , rostock or marseilles .
we are truly a multicultural society and while our lapses are well publicised , the racism here is nothing compared to britain , france , italy or germany .
i 'd be very happy to stop paying taxes to keep troops in europe .
arvind rao , new york , usa the united states and the eu have more in common , than they do differences .
it is important that they stay close and try to bring the rest of the world into harmony .
robert , london , england nick from boston refers to europe " bringing the us into line " .
bringing us in line with what , european values ?
hello , we 're not european !
we need each other from a trade perspective , nothing more .
if you want fireworks try to pressure us as austria was recently pressured for haider .
remember , there are two sides to every story .
thom , ohio , usa i was in gothenburg for the bush demonstration two days ago reidun heiene , oslo , norway i was in gothenburg for the bush demonstration two days ago .
i love both the us and european people -lrb- i lived both places -rrb- but we are witnessing our democracies being pulverised .
what we see is the removal of power from national and local level into the wto -lrb- which has a standing committee making sure that eu , nafta , apec and the other regional trade agreements obey wto -rrb- .
the system is driven by lobbying and secret negotiations ; it is destructive to the environment ; it increases poverty in both rich and poor countries .
reidun heiene , oslo , norway we should not be talking about a divorce just now , even though that attracts a lot of interest in the media .
europe can be patient for four years with an american president that most of us -lrb- here too -rrb- do n't want .
douglas bredahl , north fork , california in today 's world cutting ties is simply not possible .
europe needs the usa 's military might .
the usa needs the diplomatic clout of its european allies .
as for the supposed culture gap , the overall recent trend is that it is closing , not growing wider .
europe 's economy is becoming more like america 's free market system , and european style government programs have taken root in the us .
if europeans are truly dismayed over recent us actions , then the answer is to continue to engage them in dialogue .
cut ties with the us , and all your fears of us becoming a " rogue superpower " will come true .
david m gable , warsaw , in , usa america is such a huge place , though , it 's easy to get wrapped up in what 's going on in our own affairs david , chicago , usa believe it or not , there are americans who know what 's going on in the world and are sensitive to other cultures and politics .
america is such a huge place , though , it 's easy to get wrapped up in what 's going on in our own affairs and not be aware of what goes on in other parts of the world .
it 's also time to stop the name-calling and the whining .
we have more in common and share more values than not .
if you want things to be different , then get over yourselves and do something about it .
david , chicago , usa european intervention in the balkans only succeeded because of us air power .
many americans complain about having to act as the world 's policeman but i wonder if the " pax americana " came to an end whether americans would suffer the same crisis of identity that the british suffered when we had to give up our empire ?
i think europe has two options .
co-operation with the us or confrontation .
unfortunately i think there are forces at work within the eu determined to turn it into a super-power with the sole intention of confronting the us .
the danger of such a strategy can not be over estimated .
phil h , uk could someone please point out that more than one country has actually ratified the kyoto accords ?
i know there is one , but it is neither france , germany , the uk , spain , portugal or japan .
maybe the eu will be so kind as to ratify it first .
the eu and usa need each other , economically and militarily .
and there are n't exactly hordes of americans deciding to emigrate to the eu .
quite the opposite .
shaun s , denver , co , usa your comments before we went on air europe dwarfs the united states in terms of economy , exports and population rob holman , london , england europe dwarfs the united states in terms of economy , exports and population .
the military potential is vast , with the right level of investment .
also , europe is far more efficient and eco-friendly than the us .
i think there should now be international sanctions against the united states , until it reduces its output of greenhouse gases .
who needs the us ?
i think europe is fed up with being bullied , and is quite capable of standing up for itself .
rob holman , london , england of course europe needs the usa !
indeed the only thing that individual countries of the eu can agree on is their envious loathing of everything and anything american .
we are the cement that binds together this contrivance .
the eu only offers antithesis .
they are against this and contra that .
but when will the eu propose anything as a practical alternative other than the tired blandishments of discredited socialism and feel good " green " touchy feely stuff that has no practical benefit to anyone ?
if the eu is so keen on the kyoto treaty , then why is romania the only european country to ratify it ?
you hate us but still sit about whining and moaning , waiting for the usa to led .
grow up !
peter c. kohler , washington dc , usa bush needs to think before he acts .
his actions are those of a spoiled child .
gabriel vargas , mulege , mexico we see the eu as a great market place for us products and we seem to be in love with anything made in the eu .
i think the uk stands to profit greatly as the business link between the two .
i 'd buy some stock in that .
chris meadows , winston-salem nc , usa so far the eu has been reasonably effective at addressing the economic concerns of its member states david mellor , washington dc this debate is particularly ridiculous .
it is makes the initial flawed assumption that europe exists as a single unified entity .
there is as much contention and disagreement between national european leaders as there is between the nominal " euro " leadership and the us .
so far the eu has been reasonably effective at addressing the economic concerns of its member states .
however , it has proven ridiculously ineffective at even addressing basic security needs .
at some distant time in the future if " europe " as a unified entity comes in to existence , then the question of " does europe need the us ? " will possibly be a valid one .
david mellor , washington dc since bush took over , it 's as if we 've transported ourselves back in time about 50 years .
his policies are worrying and his abilities as a world leader are extremely questionable .
bring back clinton i say , at least he was harmless !
kate , london , uk europe is fuzzily defined and national pride will ultimately doom it to failure .
the usa is beset with social problems and likely to destroy itself from within .
i ca n't see that either can solve the other 's problems .
we can only , as we have been doing for so long , trade together for mutual benefit .
we must accept , i think , that the future belongs to china .
gary , uk turn your back on america to join the french and germans at your peril alex james , london , england turn your back on america to join the french and germans at your peril .
the uk has always had a special relationship with america , something of which the rest of europe has always been envious .
they would love to drag us into their melting pot of thinly veiled self-interest , infighting and bickering .
the uk must stand tall and hammer home the fact that we hold a unique position in the world at the centre of trading between america , europe and the commonwealth .
bush is bad news but he wo n't last and we must n't let his policies do any lasting damage to our relationship with america .
alex james , london , england i 'm from the czech republic and i want my country to become a member of the eu .
but i suppose that europe is n't unfortunately able to solve its own problems without us help - for example recent war in yugoslavian kosovo .
i think that european politicians have the ability to make things more complicated than necessary .
i ca n't understand why most of european politicians do n't agree with us plan to build new " sdi " .
the only thing that we -lrb- europeans -rrb- can do in the relationship to the usa is to criticise .
i think that europe ca n't refuse usa as its partner , because europe needs usa more than we 're able to realise -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- .
jan netopil , olomouc , czechia it is time for europe and asia to work together nick , boston , usa we should face facts - the us is an irresponsible , selfish and unreliable power .
it is time for europe to make the facts clear - that we should operate without american influence , and should create a better and more civilised global system .
it is time for europe and asia to work together , and to bring the us firmly into line .
nick , boston , usa with all this ' america ' bashing , it would be interesting to look into the future , of a world where the united states and europe were not allies .
please remember , the us has many natural resources at its disposal , and also has a very modern industrial / technological infrastructure .
compare that to europe , an over crowded landmass with limited natural resources .
if we are not allies , what side do you think could handle a direct conflict with a growing communist powerhouse similar to the ussr ?
mike , usa the eu and the un have the power to tell the us to ' take a hike ' if they so desire jim , new orleans , usa there are people in america who are sick of the united states taking the role of the ' world 's policeman ' .
many people do not realise that president clinton utilised the military more than any other president in history during peacetime .
the eu and the un have the power to tell the us to ' take a hike ' if they so desire .
i have heard from so many brits that the us is so much more than britain .
i really think that they need to take a good hard look at what the us is truly like .
while i love this country and all it stands for , there are many many problems at home which could be solved if we would worry more about what happens here in the us and less about what happens in the rest of the world .
jim , new orleans , usa as an american i sincerely apologise for george bush and his ignorance .
the european union keeping him from destroying the world is our only hope .
lori , usa america is merely suffering from the hangover of the last 50 years .
it is still clearly the only real superpower , a status which has been awarded over its huge economic and military growth since the 1950 's .
as such it has had the freedom to do as it chooses with this power .
just as critics were saying that the labour party had become arrogant with its majority , so the us became arrogant with its power .
the shift of power however , is changing .
the eu 's economy is at the same level as the us , and with the introduction of a european army , reliance on american military might will also reduce .
still , america has always been a friend to europe , this at least should not change .
mark stubbs , london europe also needs to understand that it is no longer the usa 's largest trading partner .
latin america is .
jerry , usa europe has been relatively peaceful for 56 years .
this is probably the longest peace in europe 's history , and europe can thank the usa for making it possible .
it is tiresome to hear the europeans talk of the dumb , unsophisticated americans who do n't know anything about diplomacy or politics when , left to their own devices , europeans really mucked up the world , and if it were not for america , would do it again .
europe also needs to understand that it is no longer the usa 's largest trading partner .
latin america is .
jerry bailey , fort worth , texas in america there an awful lot of people that are in favour of the death penalty , but against abortion .
in europe there are a lot of people that are pro abortion , but against the death penalty .
i fail to see what the problem is .
in america there a lot of people that want a first class military without getting involved in world affairs .
in europe there a lot of people that want to be involved in world affairs without the military muscle to back it up .
in america we have some of the most stringent environmental laws in the world , but a lot folks would like to get rid of them .
in europe you have a country that likes to nuke tropical islands while still pretending to be environmentally conscious , and lets not forget the country that still hunts whales .
what a merry bunch of ninnies ! ! ! !
mario t. majors , yokosuka , japan yes my european friends , go ahead and encourage the eu and the rest of the world to leave the usa behind .
perhaps 50 years from now when china is a superpower and indonesia is at the very least a threat to australia the eu will come to australia 's aid when its economic and political sovereignty is endangered .
yes cousins , you can be sure the belgians , greeks and danes will sail to australia 's -lrb- you can use a variety of scenarios as an example -rrb- aid in a time of crisis ...
craig , san jose , ca i am ashamed of those americans who write that we acted in ww2 only to help the europeans .
nonsense !
it was in our own interest to stop a fiend like hitler , and to stop the japanese aggression .
the main problem between us today is mr. bush and his cohorts , who got into office in a most peculiar way .
there will be a lot of pressure from americans themselves about his policies , and with both the europeans and americans disturbed about everything the administration here has in mind , everything should come out for the better .
keep up the criticism - we need your help. megan sweet , camp sherman , oregon just try cutting economic ties across the atlantic .
you could n't if you wanted to .
don , usa i laugh at much of the naiveté expressed on this question , which is moot but carefully phrased to inflame nationalistic fever .
you talk as if the world is still in the 19th century .
that would have been a more appropriate century for isolationist talk because it 's much too late now .
how much nationalistic integrity do you think your country has in this day and age of multi-national mega-corporations ?
when the ford corporation of america can continue to collect stock revenues from german companies during world war ii what chance do you think there is that any western nation is going to be allowed to cut off another .
you want to cause a world depression that will make the 1930 's look like a beach holiday ?
just try cutting economic ties across the atlantic .
you could n't if you wanted to .
as far as world leadership is concerned europe has their chance in macedonia right now .
bush is sick of that balkans mess so if the kla refuses to leave macedonia then europe can remove them themselves .
i 'm sure the kla will vacate when faced with europes ' internationally respected eu rapid deployment force armed with sputtering indignation .
don drakulich , usa europe should consider the fact that the us is pulling away from its european roots at an ever-increasing rate .
hispanic and asian emigration into the us will soon make the people of european extraction a minority group .
bush is right in not pandering to europe and increasing overtures toward mexico and latin america .
this group is currently the us largest trading partner and its importance will continue to increase .
peter cuneo , dix hills , usa the question implies europe is a power on equal footing with the us .
neither economically , not militarily , is this the case .
the uk would more likely petition to become the 51st state than leave nato , and we all know france is too scared of germany to trade nato protection for the eu .
as far as the us being out of touch with the rest of the world

in his keynote mansion house address , mr brown underlined that the british government 's policy towards the euro remains " considered and cautious " . "
we will not take risks with britain 's hard-won stability " gordon brown speaking to an audience of bankers and merchants in the city of london on wednesday evening , mr brown summed up the government 's attitude as one of " pro-euro realism " .
and he once again emphasised that the treasury 's assessment of the government 's five economic tests for joining the euro will be " comprehensive and rigorous " .
" to join in the wrong way or on the wrong basis without rigorously ensuring the tests are met , would not be in the national economic interest .
" because the government is determined that we will make the right long-term decisions for britain , we will not take risks with britain 's hard-won stability , " mr brown said .
' confused messages ' mr brown is aware that the pound has been volatile in the past two weeks as financial markets sensed that a big election victory for prime minister tony blair 's government on 7 june made an early dash for euro entry more likely . "
there is not going to be any sudden dash for europe " peter jay , bbc economics editor his speech is being seen as a move to cool that speculation and effectively rule out an early referendum on euro entry .
liberal democrat treasury spokesman matthew taylor said mr brown was " sending out confused messages " about the euro .
he said : " he does n't seem to be able to make up his mind whether he is in favour or not .
" if labour are serious about joining the euro , they need to make clear their exchange rate target and the benefits they believe the euro will bring . "
" he does n't seem to be able to make up his mind whether he is in favour or not " lib dem treasury spokesman matthew taylor the bbc 's economics editor peter jay said it was an " open secret " that mr brown thought the british system of setting interest rates through the bank of england monetary policy committee - set up by labour in 1997 - was more open and accountable than the european method .
he said that mr brown 's speech showed that " there is not going to be any sudden dash for europe . "
' eu reform ' in his speech , mr brown emphasised that technical work would have to be completed before the treasury 's euro assessment could begin .
but he repeated the government 's promise that it would be completed within two years from now .
he said the government and business " must join together in putting the case unequivocally for britain being in europe - a stronger britain on the basis of a strong and secure relationship with europe " .
he also urged the eu to complete its economic reforms , to move quickly towards a single market in utilities , energy , telecoms and financial and professional services .

in his keynote mansion house address , mr brown underlined that the british government 's policy towards the euro remains " considered and cautious " .
we will not take risks with britain 's hard-won stability gordon brown speaking to an audience of bankers and merchants in the city of london on wednesday evening , mr brown summed up the government 's attitude as one of " pro-euro realism " .
and he once again emphasised that the treasury 's assessment of the government 's five economic tests for joining the euro will be " comprehensive and rigorous " .
" to join in the wrong way or on the wrong basis without rigorously ensuring the tests are met , would not be in the national economic interest .
" because the government is determined that we will make the right long-term decisions for britain , we will not take risks with britain 's hard-won stability , " mr brown said .
' confused messages ' mr brown is aware that the pound has been volatile in the past two weeks as financial markets sensed that a big election victory for prime minister tony blair 's government on 7 june made an early dash for euro entry more likely .
there is not going to be any sudden dash for europe peter jay , bbc economics editor his speech is being seen as a move to cool that speculation and effectively rule out an early referendum on euro entry .
liberal democrat treasury spokesman matthew taylor said mr brown was " sending out confused messages " about the euro .
he said : " he does n't seem to be able to make up his mind whether he is in favour or not .
" if labour are serious about joining the euro , they need to make clear their exchange rate target and the benefits they believe the euro will bring . "
he does n't seem to be able to make up his mind whether he is in favour or not lib dem treasury spokesman matthew taylor the bbc 's economics editor peter jay said it was an " open secret " that mr brown thought the british system of setting interest rates through the bank of england monetary policy committee - set up by labour in 1997 - was more open and accountable than the european method .
he said that mr brown 's speech showed that " there is not going to be any sudden dash for europe . "
' eu reform ' in his speech , mr brown emphasised that technical work would have to be completed before the treasury 's euro assessment could begin .
but he repeated the government 's promise that it would be completed within two years from now .
mr brown with bank of england governor sir edward george he said the government and business " must join together in putting the case unequivocally for britain being in europe - a stronger britain on the basis of a strong and secure relationship with europe " .
he also urged the eu to complete its economic reforms , to move quickly towards a single market in utilities , energy , telecoms and financial and professional services .
" the more europe embraces economic reform and institutional reform , the better it is for britain and europe , " mr brown said .
liberalisation of markets mr brown also called for liberalisation of the telecoms market by 2001 and liberalisation of financial services by 2004 .

his move follows disappointing returns on a series of big budget disney films , most notably the current blockbuster pearl harbor .
but disney insisted that schneider - who oversaw production on pearl harbor - was leaving to start his own company and go back to his first love , broadway .
pearl harbor , a world war ii romance starring ben affleck and british actress kate beckinsale , had been touted as the next titanic .
but it has failed to impress critics or live up to expectations at the box office , particularly in the us .
it cost £ 179m in total , taking the spend on worldwide promotion into account , but after a month on release it has not broken even .
it started well , making $ 75m -lrb- £ 52m -rrb- in its first weekend in the us , which was the long memorial holiday .
but the audience then dropped 50 % the following two weekends .
the main criticisms levelled at pearl harbor have been its simplified storyline , poor dialogue and glamorising of us participation in the war .
competition but , aside from pearl harbor , disney has recently produced a number of prominent features that have failed to live up to expectations .
this comes at a time when the company has been making fewer films and has cut its animation staff by 25 % .
its animated adventure atlantis : the lost empire also received a lukewarm reception .
it came after a similar lack of enthusiasm for 102 dalmatians and the emperor 's new groove .
but , pearl harbor was also released at a time of stiff competition , namely from dreamworks ' computer animated fantasy shrek .
they came out on the same weekend but shrek is now ahead by almost £ 30m at the us box office .
other films giving pearl harbor a hard time have been john travolta 's swordfish and lara croft : tomb raider with angelina jolie .
japan elsewhere , pearl harbor has not fared so badly .
it is still number one at the uk box office after three weeks , although shrek and tomb raider are yet to open .
but the major key to its global success will be its reception in japan - the second-largest film market in the world .
the film will receive its première on thursday before opening to the public on 14 july .
some of the dialogue has been changed and the film is being sold as a romance rather than a war film to try to meet japanese sensibilities .
a disney spokeswoman said schneider would remain " very close " to disney chairman and chief executive michael eisner .
no replacement for schneider has been named .
disney said three executives would absorb his responsibilities while remaining in their present posts .

bbc news -pipe- forum -pipe- newly-knighted head , kevin satchwell quizzed categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : talking point : forum front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 21 june , 2001 , 09:31 gmt 10:31 uk newly-knighted head , kevin satchwell quizzed to listen to coverage of the forum , select the link below : 28k one of england 's most successful head teachers has been knighted in the queen 's birthday honours .
kevin satchwell is head of thomas telford school in shropshire .
the technology college last year became the first non-selective state school in which all the gcse / gnvq candidates got top grades .
this year it has been in the headlines again because of its success in selling its online information technology course to other schools - bringing in so much money it can afford to put £ 1m into the formation of one of the new city academies .
why is the school doing so well ?
what is the secret of his success ?
does he believe that comprehensives should be modernised ?
sir kevin satchwell answered your questions in a live forum .
newshost : first of all kevin congratulations .
what does it mean to yourself and your school for you to receive a knighthood ?
and will you be known as kevin or sir kevin to your staff from now on ?
kevin satchwell : the staff can call me what they want , i am not too particular about insisting that people call me sir kevin or that sort of thing - they will do whatever they feel relaxed with - there is n't really an issue there .
but turning to the honour , to be quite frank with you , this award is n't just for me it is for everyone connected with thomas telford school because the children all own a part of this and the staff because as far as i am concerned had the children not achieved what they had achieved and had the staff not done what they did to enable the youngsters to achieve then perhaps the recognition of the school would not have been highlighted in the way that it has .
so this is an award for everyone involved with the school and it has been wonderful to share it with them .
newshost : in today 's queen 's speech you might have heard that the government is putting forward proposals to increase the involvement of business partners , religious groups and voluntary groups in running schools .
how do you feel about that ?
kevin satchwell : well personally i feel very relaxed about it .
we consider that we are very much at the forefront of what is happening in terms of that agenda .
the issue comes down to that we have got to find as many different diverse ways that we can to ensure that the quality of education that 's available for youngsters is the very best that we can make it .
i heard a quotation last night from michael barber which impressed me .
what they are looking for at government levels is that they have a minimum high standard .
now if we can have a minimum high standard for everyone and then following that we can have other particular institutions or organisations that are going to go further than the minimum high standard then that is a great way of approaching it .
now to achieve these sorts of standards , we ca n't do it on the basis of organisations that have existed in the past and that is largely because the education service has now been deregulated .
the education service is no longer the exclusive domain of local authorities , it is no longer the exclusive domain of the publishing companies or the examinations boards - it belongs to all of us .
what this opportunity brings us with the variety of different people - public and private sectors - all working together .
it means that everyone who has got a stake in education has got something to bring to the party and can actually use that to help improve the quality of education for young adults .
i think it has got to be a good thing .
newshost : sarah mcmichael , london , uk many teachers complain that they are unable to teach well due to disruptive pupils in the classroom .
how do you solve this problem at your school ?
kevin satchwell : i do n't think it is a problem that is just solved at this school , i think it is a problem that is addressed in many schools .
it is quite a conundrum this one because if you could give a simple solution to this what would happen is that you would patent it and everyone would go for it .
but i think what lies at the heart of this is finding out what it is in every young adult that stimulates them , interests them and gets them involved .
often if you get to that and you then get a youngster to show their prowess , whether they are interested in sport or whether they are interested in languages or whether they are scientists or whether it is charity work .
it is finding that something special in every young adult that when you look at them , you see that glow on their face .
that is the start and then you begin harness and nurture that .
that is why i am very much into things like specialist schools because it allows us to provide for youngster so they can neatly fit in to what that school is prepared to offer them - it fits neatly because it fits the aspirations of the youngster .
in my view that 's got to be the way forward .
find out what it is that makes the youngster tick and then use that to build up their self-esteem and get them involved in education in the way that will be meaningful .
newshost : do you share concerns that the problem has got worse in the last decade ?
kevin satchwell : i think there are issues generally over law and order but i think that is the wider issue .
i do n't think society 's evils can be thrust upon the schools and teachers blamed for this - i do n't think it is anything to do with that - i think it is a much , much broader agenda .
what i do know is the sort of young adults that i come into contract with - the critical mass and more than the critical mass of young adults - are lovely people to be with .
even those youngsters that may even be facing difficulties through adolescence - and most of them do go through that phase .
and what enables them to go through that phase is by teachers working with them to build up their self-esteem and find out what it is that makes them tick .
yes , i think we have got challenges ahead but it is generally to do with law and order across board .
but i think teachers are doing a magnificent job in trying to get to the heart of what makes youngsters tick .
once you get there and you work on that then they will then begin to work on the other things that we know will be important to them in later life .
newshost : malcolm moss , colchester .
congratulations on your knighthood - it 's well deserved .
you have nine deputy headteachers .
have you been able to fund those posts through standard funding or by enterprise ?
how crucial is that staffing structure to your school 's success ?
kevin satchwell : starting with the last question first , the decision of having nine deputy headteachers is critical to the success of this school .
because each of those nine deputy heads has a curriculum responsibility and this is probably the uniqueness of it .
one is responsible for maths , one is responsible for science , one is responsible for technology and so on .
the reason that i wanted deputy heads who were specialists in their areas is because i wanted them to lead the teaching - in other words to be heads of departments as well .
that enables me to answer the first part of the question .
so by having nine deputy heads , who are also in effect heads of department , it means that we have a very flat management structure and therefore it becomes cost-effective .
because in effect it is nine heads of department that i do n't have to appoint in addition to deputy heads and senior teachers .
so that enables me to come up with a very cost-effective model .
so i am able to say to malcolm that i can do it through the standard funding to the school .
i would encourage other schools to look at organising flat management structures because it does enable you to direct the people .
the strange thing in education is that people who are good at teaching tend to get promoted away from teaching .
what i am very keen to ensure is that the people who are good at teaching are kept at the interface with the youngsters but they can still have the status and progression and widening of their career portfolio by combining the roles of things like deputy heads with head of department .
newshost : has your school faced any problems with recruiting staff ?
kevin satchwell : yes , we have had difficulties - like all other schools - as was indicated in the times educational supplement recently , we have great difficulty in recruiting in maths .
i think we have got difficulties nationwide there .
one would have to say that we have got to address those issues and we have got to find ways in which we can encourage more people to apply to become teachers .
newshost : peter , sheffield what do you feel are the main challenges facing state education in the future ?
what changes can we expect to see ?
kevin satchwell : part of the answer to this question will be embodied in the queen 's speech today .
what we have got to do is to unleash the enthusiasm of private and public sectors to work together so that we can improve the quality of education - that can work .
it has been breath of fresh air working at the thomas telford school for the last 10 years , working with people from industry - it has been a totally different experience .
i can say that because i have worked in both systems as a head .
i was highly satisfied with the previous system where we worked through what was a largely a council chamber atmosphere .
newshost : what have they brought that was n't there before ?
kevin satchwell : they bring a slickness - the bureaucracy is considerable shortened .
they empower the head to get on with decision-making , they set very precise goals and they are very decisive in terms of ensuring that you get the quality of support that you want .
heads should be allowed to run schools in my view and that is what i found that working with the business community has allowed me to do .
newshost : martin brown , surrey , uk what do you think makes a good teacher ?
kevin satchwell : i go back to why i went into it in the first place .
i think there is something burning inside you - it is a sort of passion that you want to work with children and you have a love for things like your subject .
the prospect of sharing something with children that you enjoy and love - whether you are a history teacher or maths teacher , scientist or technologist - and seeing the wonderment that that can bring to youngsters .
those sorts of people that enjoy being with young people and have a passion for their subject - my advice to them is become a teacher as there is nothing more satisfying or fulfilling .
you have got to have that passion of wanting to teach and then do n't be afraid to try new things out .
newshost : you sound very optimistic when lots of people have expressed some pessimism about the future of teaching .
do you think that the changes which the government is proposing will improve the lot of the teacher and will encourage more people to come into the profession ?
kevin satchwell : oh yes .
i have no strong political views either way .
i will follow the agenda of whichever government is in control .
but no one can complain about the fact that this government that is currently in control has done a cracking job in key stage one and two - the standards of numeracy and literacy have soared and that has got to be good for young people .
the focus is now on the secondary schools in key stages three and four and they are very ambitious about what they want to do there in terms of raising standards and there is considerable additional investment that is coming into the schools .
my view is that there is a wonderful opportunity that lies ahead in the next four years .
of course there are obstacles and we have already referred to the biggest obstacle facing us and that is recruitment into the profession .
but if you put that aside , this next four or five years is going to be terrific fun because the government is giving us an opportunity to get involved in the opportunities that have arisen as a result of the deregulation of the education service .
nobody is stopping anybody working with somebody else .
i find that any school that wants to work with us at thomas telford school , we will work with them .
if they do n't want to work with us , we wo n't and we can understand that but there is a great camaraderie that is emerging in the teaching profession at present .
there is also a general acceptance that there are different types of schools .
i have no strong belief about whether it is a comprehensive school , a grammar school , a special school - but at the end of the day it is down to the people and what the people will do to make that school a good school .
the government have put education right at the top of the agenda and who can knock them for it .
newshost : do you think we should scrap the term comprehensive ?
kevin satchwell : it would n't bother me if they did because as i explained earlier , a school is a school is a school .
i think all schools will range between being moderately successful to extremely successful and they will have their reasons for that because at the end of the day i do n't think that parents get too preoccupied with the sorts of agendas that are put forward by politicians .
i have no strong views about whether comprehensive education should stay or go - what matters is what happens inside those schools .
newshost : sheila , nottingham if you had a magic wand and you could ask anything from the new education secretary , what would you ask for to help tackle the apparent shortage of teachers ?
kevin satchwell : what we have got to do is to allow heads to recruit their own trainees .
if every school was allowed to train its own trainees on a reasonable bursary or salary for them .
in other words , cut out the bureaucracy of having to be trained under the traditional pgce programme - they would go straight into schools .
so we could advertise to recruit in our own area and i could bring in say a dozen trainees into this school .
i could train one in french , one in german , one in english , one in pe , one in technology and so forth .
they would be paid a trainee 's honorarium of maybe £ 12,000 - £ 14,000 year for the training year .
at the year , if they come up to scratch and there are opportunities available in the school , then they actually get a job in the school .
newshost : would that mean the end of formal teacher training colleges ?
kevin satchwell : yes - why not ?
i am quite relaxed about that .
i think that schools are well positioned to be able to train their own teachers and i think it would be a simple system where we could solve our own problems locally as well .
many of the problems to do with teacher recruitment are very localised - there are sever difficulties , for example , in london .
it is easy for us to be critical of the people who are not providing the teachers for us .
headteachers have been quick to come forward and say - the government is not providing the teachers for us .
there are all sorts of reasons why prospective teachers either do n't want to carry on doing that or wo n't even enter into the prospect of becoming a teacher .
what i have said is give the responsibility to the heads .
so that heads would be responsible for the recruitment of teachers themselves and let the schools train them and give the funding to the schools so that they can have direct control over what is happening in creating the future profession .
newshost : bryan williamson , telford , shropshire .
is n't it the case that the thomas telford school is , in fact , selective ?
if the best students from any area are focused in one school , then the results will always be excellent .
the other schools in the area recruit pupils dependent on where they live .
kevin satchwell : that is not the case as far as thomas telford is concerned .
let me make the situation crystal clear .
the rules of admission for this school are available to anyone - they are transparent , they are there on the school website - and it makes it crystal clear what the admission arrangements are here .
if bryan was to talk to anyone of the primary heads in telford they would explain to him that they have had special needs children right the way through to high-flyers who have come to thomas telford school .
this sort of interpretation is largely based upon the myth that existed when the school came into being 10 years ago .
i understand the reasons why there was reluctance to accept thomas telford school because of its intention to have a radical approach .
but the idea that thomas telford only takes the brightest youngsters is just a total untruth .
there is a full range of ability here - it has to be .
it is embodied within the funding agreement with the secretary of state and if we did n't adhere to that funding agreement then we would n't receive the funding to educate the youngsters .
newshost : tim , wolverhampton .
what do you think the next step will be in your career ?
can you foresee a time when headteachers will become members of the house of lords ?
will there be people 's peers drawn from the classroom ?
kevin satchwell : relating to the peerage issue - that is the last thing that is on my mind .
i have far too much work to do with schools and far too much work to enjoy being alongside youngsters .
as to the future , nothing is going to move me from the interface of working with youngsters .
yes , i do receive sometimes quite lucrative offers to take on alternative positions of work .
but going back to why i went into the teaching profession in the first place - it is because i had that burning desire to want to work alongside children because there is nothing more satisfying .
they could offer me a million pounds tomorrow to do another job and i would n't do it because there is no more satisfying job than working alongside youngsters .
every morning i drive to work and i ca n't wait to get to work .
it is great to come into school and see the smiles on the youngsters ' faces , the staff are wonderful to work with - there are no pockets of misery here - everyone wants to get on with each other .
if i had any intention of wanting to leave this then i would be a mug .

bbc news -pipe- film -pipe- disney 's pearl harbor boss quits low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : entertainment : film front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's stephen evans in new york " a film about pearl habour that seems relunctant to mention the war " real 28k thursday , 21 june , 2001 , 09:31 gmt 10:31 uk disney 's pearl harbor boss quits expectations were high for the success of pearl harbor walt disney executive peter schneider has announced he is stepping down after 17 months as head of the company 's film and tv studios .
his move follows disappointing returns on a series of big budget disney films , most notably the current blockbuster pearl harbor .
but disney insisted that schneider - who oversaw production on pearl harbor - was leaving to start his own company and go back to his first love , broadway .
pearl harbor , a world war ii romance starring ben affleck and british actress kate beckinsale , had been touted as the next titanic .
the film stars kate beckinsale but it has failed to impress critics or live up to expectations at the box office , particularly in the us .
it cost £ 179m in total , taking the spend on worldwide promotion into account , but after a month on release it has not broken even .
it started well , making $ 75m -lrb- £ 52m -rrb- in its first weekend in the us , which was the long memorial holiday .
but the audience then dropped 50 % the following two weekends .
the main criticisms levelled at pearl harbor have been its simplified storyline , poor dialogue and glamorising of us participation in the war .
competition but , aside from pearl harbor , disney has recently produced a number of prominent features that have failed to live up to expectations .
this comes at a time when the company has been making fewer films and has cut its animation staff by 25 % .
shrek has been tough competition its animated adventure atlantis : the lost empire also received a lukewarm reception .
it came after a similar lack of enthusiasm for 102 dalmatians and the emperor 's new groove .
but , pearl harbor was also released at a time of stiff competition , namely from dreamworks ' computer animated fantasy shrek .
they came out on the same weekend but shrek is now ahead by almost £ 30m at the us box office .
other films giving pearl harbor a hard time have been john travolta 's swordfish and lara croft : tomb raider with angelina jolie .
japan elsewhere , pearl harbor has not fared so badly .
it is still number one at the uk box office after three weeks , although shrek and tomb raider are yet to open .
but the major key to its global success will be its reception in japan - the second-largest film market in the world .
john travolta has been a hit in swordfish the film will receive its première on thursday before opening to the public on 14 july .
some of the dialogue has been changed and the film is being sold as a romance rather than a war film to try to meet japanese sensibilities .
a disney spokeswoman said schneider would remain " very close " to disney chairman and chief executive michael eisner .
no replacement for schneider has been named .
disney said three executives would absorb his responsibilities while remaining in their present posts .

kevin satchwell is head of thomas telford school in shropshire .
the technology college last year became the first non-selective state school in which all the gcse / gnvq candidates got top grades .
this year it has been in the headlines again because of its success in selling its online information technology course to other schools - bringing in so much money it can afford to put £ 1m into the formation of one of the new city academies .
why is the school doing so well ?
what is the secret of his success ?
does he believe that comprehensives should be modernised ?
sir kevin satchwell answered your questions in a live forum .
newshost : first of all kevin congratulations .
what does it mean to yourself and your school for you to receive a knighthood ?
and will you be known as kevin or sir kevin to your staff from now on ?
kevin satchwell : the staff can call me what they want , i am not too particular about insisting that people call me sir kevin or that sort of thing - they will do whatever they feel relaxed with - there is n't really an issue there .
but turning to the honour , to be quite frank with you , this award is n't just for me it is for everyone connected with thomas telford school because the children all own a part of this and the staff because as far as i am concerned had the children not achieved what they had achieved and had the staff not done what they did to enable the youngsters to achieve then perhaps the recognition of the school would not have been highlighted in the way that it has .
so this is an award for everyone involved with the school and it has been wonderful to share it with them .
newshost : in today 's queen 's speech you might have heard that the government is putting forward proposals to increase the involvement of business partners , religious groups and voluntary groups in running schools .
how do you feel about that ?
kevin satchwell : well personally i feel very relaxed about it .
we consider that we are very much at the forefront of what is happening in terms of that agenda .
the issue comes down to that we have got to find as many different diverse ways that we can to ensure that the quality of education that 's available for youngsters is the very best that we can make it .
i heard a quotation last night from michael barber which impressed me .
what they are looking for at government levels is that they have a minimum high standard .
now if we can have a minimum high standard for everyone and then following that we can have other particular institutions or organisations that are going to go further than the minimum high standard then that is a great way of approaching it .
now to achieve these sorts of standards , we ca n't do it on the basis of organisations that have existed in the past and that is largely because the education service has now been deregulated .
the education service is no longer the exclusive domain of local authorities , it is no longer the exclusive domain of the publishing companies or the examinations boards - it belongs to all of us .
what this opportunity brings us with the variety of different people - public and private sectors - all working together .
it means that everyone who has got a stake in education has got something to bring to the party and can actually use that to help improve the quality of education for young adults .
i think it has got to be a good thing .
newshost : sarah mcmichael , london , uk many teachers complain that they are unable to teach well due to disruptive pupils in the classroom .
how do you solve this problem at your school ?
kevin satchwell : i do n't think it is a problem that is just solved at this school , i think it is a problem that is addressed in many schools .
it is quite a conundrum this one because if you could give a simple solution to this what would happen is that you would patent it and everyone would go for it .
but i think what lies at the heart of this is finding out what it is in every young adult that stimulates them , interests them and gets them involved .
often if you get to that and you then get a youngster to show their prowess , whether they are interested in sport or whether they are interested in languages or whether they are scientists or whether it is charity work .
it is finding that something special in every young adult that when you look at them , you see that glow on their face .
that is the start and then you begin harness and nurture that .
that is why i am very much into things like specialist schools because it allows us to provide for youngster so they can neatly fit in to what that school is prepared to offer them - it fits neatly because it fits the aspirations of the youngster .
in my view that 's got to be the way forward .
find out what it is that makes the youngster tick and then use that to build up their self-esteem and get them involved in education in the way that will be meaningful .
newshost : do you share concerns that the problem has got worse in the last decade ?
kevin satchwell : i think there are issues generally over law and order but i think that is the wider issue .
i do n't think society 's evils can be thrust upon the schools and teachers blamed for this - i do n't think it is anything to do with that - i think it is a much , much broader agenda .
what i do know is the sort of young adults that i come into contract with - the critical mass and more than the critical mass of young adults - are lovely people to be with .
even those youngsters that may even be facing difficulties through adolescence - and most of them do go through that phase .
and what enables them to go through that phase is by teachers working with them to build up their self-esteem and find out what it is that makes them tick .
yes , i think we have got challenges ahead but it is generally to do with law and order across board .
but i think teachers are doing a magnificent job in trying to get to the heart of what makes youngsters tick .
once you get there and you work on that then they will then begin to work on the other things that we know will be important to them in later life .
newshost : malcolm moss , colchester .
congratulations on your knighthood - it 's well deserved .
you have nine deputy headteachers .
have you been able to fund those posts through standard funding or by enterprise ?
how crucial is that staffing structure to your school 's success ?
kevin satchwell : starting with the last question first , the decision of having nine deputy headteachers is critical to the success of this school .
because each of those nine deputy heads has a curriculum responsibility and this is probably the uniqueness of it .
one is responsible for maths , one is responsible for science , one is responsible for technology and so on .
the reason that i wanted deputy heads who were specialists in their areas is because i wanted them to lead the teaching - in other words to be heads of departments as well .
that enables me to answer the first part of the question .
so by having nine deputy heads , who are also in effect heads of department , it means that we have a very flat management structure and therefore it becomes cost-effective .
because in effect it is nine heads of department that i do n't have to appoint in addition to deputy heads and senior teachers .
so that enables me to come up with a very cost-effective model .
so i am able to say to malcolm that i can do it through the standard funding to the school .
i would encourage other schools to look at organising flat management structures because it does enable you to direct the people .
the strange thing in education is that people who are good at teaching tend to get promoted away from teaching .
what i am very keen to ensure is that the people who are good at teaching are kept at the interface with the youngsters but they can still have the status and progression and widening of their career portfolio by combining the roles of things like deputy heads with head of department .
newshost : has your school faced any problems with recruiting staff ?
kevin satchwell : yes , we have had difficulties - like all other schools - as was indicated in the times educational supplement recently , we have great difficulty in recruiting in maths .
i think we have got difficulties nationwide there .
one would have to say that we have got to address those issues and we have got to find ways in which we can encourage more people to apply to become teachers .
newshost : peter , sheffield what do you feel are the main challenges facing state education in the future ?
what changes can we expect to see ?
kevin satchwell : part of the answer to this question will be embodied in the queen 's speech today .
what we have got to do is to unleash the enthusiasm of private and public sectors to work together so that we can improve the quality of education - that can work .
it has been breath of fresh air working at the thomas telford school for the last 10 years , working with people from industry - it has been a totally different experience .
i can say that because i have worked in both systems as a head .
i was highly satisfied with the previous system where we worked through what was a largely a council chamber atmosphere .
newshost : what have they brought that was n't there before ?
kevin satchwell : they bring a slickness - the bureaucracy is considerable shortened .
they empower the head to get on with decision-making , they set very precise goals and they are very decisive in terms of ensuring that you get the quality of support that you want .
heads should be allowed to run schools in my view and that is what i found that working with the business community has allowed me to do .
newshost : martin brown , surrey , uk what do you think makes a good teacher ?
kevin satchwell : i go back to why i went into it in the first place .
i think there is something burning inside you - it is a sort of passion that you want to work with children and you have a love for things like your subject .
the prospect of sharing something with children that you enjoy and love - whether you are a history teacher or maths teacher , scientist or technologist - and seeing the wonderment that that can bring to youngsters .
those sorts of people that enjoy being with young people and have a passion for their subject - my advice to them is become a teacher as there is nothing more satisfying or fulfilling .
you have got to have that passion of wanting to teach and then do n't be afraid to try new things out .
newshost : you sound very optimistic when lots of people have expressed some pessimism about the future of teaching .
do you think that the changes which the government is proposing will improve the lot of the teacher and will encourage more people to come into the profession ?
kevin satchwell : oh yes .
i have no strong political views either way .
i will follow the agenda of whichever government is in control .
but no one can complain about the fact that this government that is currently in control has done a cracking job in key stage one and two - the standards of numeracy and literacy have soared and that has got to be good for young people .
the focus is now on the secondary schools in key stages three and four and they are very ambitious about what they want to do there in terms of raising standards and there is considerable additional investment that is coming into the schools .
my view is that there is a wonderful opportunity that lies ahead in the next four years .
of course there are obstacles and we have already referred to the biggest obstacle facing us and that is recruitment into the profession .
but if you put that aside , this next four or five years is going to be terrific fun because the government is giving us an opportunity to get involved in the opportunities that have arisen as a result of the deregulation of the education service .
nobody is stopping anybody working with somebody else .
i find that any school that wants to work with us at thomas telford school , we will work with them .
if they do n't want to work with us , we wo n't and we can understand that but there is a great camaraderie that is emerging in the teaching profession at present .
there is also a general acceptance that there are different types of schools .
i have no strong belief about whether it is a comprehensive school , a grammar school , a special school - but at the end of the day it is down to the people and what the people will do to make that school a good school .
the government have put education right at the top of the agenda and who can knock them for it .
newshost : do you think we should scrap the term comprehensive ?
kevin satchwell : it would n't bother me if they did because as i explained earlier , a school is a school is a school .
i think all schools will range between being moderately successful to extremely successful and they will have their reasons for that because at the end of the day i do n't think that parents get too preoccupied with the sorts of agendas that are put forward by politicians .
i have no strong views about whether comprehensive education should stay or go - what matters is what happens inside those schools .
newshost : sheila , nottingham if you had a magic wand and you could ask anything from the new education secretary , what would you ask for to help tackle the apparent shortage of teachers ?
kevin satchwell : what we have got to do is to allow heads to recruit their own trainees .
if every school was allowed to train its own trainees on a reasonable bursary or salary for them .
in other words , cut out the bureaucracy of having to be trained under the traditional pgce programme - they would go straight into schools .
so we could advertise to recruit in our own area and i could bring in say a dozen trainees into this school .
i could train one in french , one in german , one in english , one in pe , one in technology and so forth .
they would be paid a trainee 's honorarium of maybe £ 12,000 - £ 14,000 year for the training year .
at the year , if they come up to scratch and there are opportunities available in the school , then they actually get a job in the school .
newshost : would that mean the end of formal teacher training colleges ?
kevin satchwell : yes - why not ?
i am quite relaxed about that .
i think that schools are well positioned to be able to train their own teachers and i think it would be a simple system where we could solve our own problems locally as well .
many of the problems to do with teacher recruitment are very localised - there are sever difficulties , for example , in london .
it is easy for us to be critical of the people who are not providing the teachers for us .
headteachers have been quick to come forward and say - the government is not providing the teachers for us .
there are all sorts of reasons why prospective teachers either do n't want to carry on doing that or wo n't even enter into the prospect of becoming a teacher .
what i have said is give the responsibility to the heads .
so that heads would be responsible for the recruitment of teachers themselves and let the schools train them and give the funding to the schools so that they can have direct control over what is happening in creating the future profession .
newshost : bryan williamson , telford , shropshire .
is n't it the case that the thomas telford school is , in fact , selective ?
if the best students from any area are focused in one school , then the results will always be excellent .
the other schools in the area recruit pupils dependent on where they live .
kevin satchwell : that is not the case as far as thomas telford is concerned .
let me make the situation crystal clear .
the rules of admission for this school are available to anyone - they are transparent , they are there on the school website - and it makes it crystal clear what the admission arrangements are here .
if bryan was to talk to anyone of the primary heads in telford they would explain to him that they have had special needs children right the way through to high-flyers who have come to thomas telford school .
this sort of interpretation is largely based upon the myth that existed when the school came into being 10 years ago .
i understand the reasons why there was reluctance to accept thomas telford school because of its intention to have a radical approach .
but the idea that thomas telford only takes the brightest youngsters is just a total untruth .
there is a full range of ability here - it has to be .
it is embodied within the funding agreement with the secretary of state and if we did n't adhere to that funding agreement then we would n't receive the funding to educate the youngsters .
newshost : tim , wolverhampton .
what do you think the next step will be in your career ?
can you foresee a time when headteachers will become members of the house of lords ?
will there be people 's peers drawn from the classroom ?
kevin satchwell : relating to the peerage issue - that is the last thing that is on my mind .
i have far too much work to do with schools and far too much work to enjoy being alongside youngsters .
as to the future , nothing is going to move me from the interface of working with youngsters .
yes , i do receive sometimes quite lucrative offers to take on alternative positions of work .
but going back to why i went into the teaching profession in the first place - it is because i had that burning desire to want to work alongside children because there is nothing more satisfying .
they could offer me a million pounds tomorrow to do another job and i would n't do it because there is no more satisfying job than working alongside youngsters .
every morning i drive to work and i ca n't wait to get to work .
it is great to come into school and see the smiles on the youngsters ' faces , the staff are wonderful to work with - there are no pockets of misery here - everyone wants to get on with each other .
if i had any intention of wanting to leave this then i would be a mug .

post-natal depression post-natal depression can occur from about two weeks after the birth of a child to two years after and differs from the mood swings suffered by many in the first few days after the child is born .
it is thought to be caused by a combination of sudden changes and a variety of psychological and environmental factors .
symptoms can range from the mild post birth depression that occurs following about two thirds of pregnancies to the more severe cases , where the mother has to be hospitalised to stop her injuring herself or her baby .
the most severe form of postnatal depression is depressive psychosis .
this follows only about one in 1,000 pregnancies and usually starts two to three weeks after childbirth .
depressive psychosis is marked by severe mental problems ; threats of suicide or harm to the baby and sometimes even delusions .
treatment requires admission to hospital and often antidepressant drugs and possible family therapy .

many people who need treatment for depression suffer further bouts later in life .

according to research prepared for vinexpo , the world 's largest wine trade fair currently under way in bordeaux , french producers have lost their stranglehold on the british palate .
for the first time ever , none of the top ten wines on the rapidly growing uk market is now bottled in france .
instead , australian producers have captured seven of the top ten places , indicating a triumph for flashy marketing , eye-catching packaging and a user-friendly approach .
other new world winemakers , notably in chile , new zealand and the united states , are following australia 's lead , gaining a strong toehold in britain .
and france 's fall from fashion is mirrored by other traditional producing countries such as italy , spain and especially germany , whose uk market share has dropped by 22 % in the last five years .
some old world winemakers have vowed to fight back .
boozy brits this year 's vinexpo is focusing on britain , and it 's not hard to see why : at a time when global wine consumption is falling , britain is one of the few growth markets .
wine consumption in britain has risen by 60 % in the last ten years ; now , the british drink an average of 20 litres of wine each a year .
and although some at vinexpo have talked of a global wine glut , the british market seems to have plenty of room to grow further .
average per-capita consumption in france and italy is close to 60 litres a year .
britons are also among the most adventurous wine drinkers in the world , the research found , with wines from 43 countries available on the retail market .
canny consumers but that very adventurousness has hit traditional producer countries hard .
" british consumers are becoming much more aware of what 's on offer , " says caroline park , promotions manager for the australian wine bureau in london .
while french wines still just about hold the leading position in the british restaurant market , they have been overtaken by the australians among consumers .
ms park says that australian wines now command some 50 % of the key middle market in britain , where wines retail at £ 4-6 a bottle .
sensible strategy the australian secret lies in a more corporate approach to the market , said chris brook-carter , managing editor of just-drinks.com , an industry web site .
australian firms have brought wine marketing into the 21st century chris brook-carter , just-drinks.com while the french wine industry is fragmented into hundreds of mainly small chateaux , australia 's wine industry is dominated by three large companies - brl hardy , southcorp and foster 's .
this allows the australians - unlike most traditional producers - to offer a consistent , reliable , branded product .
" no one 's going to spend £ 8 on a bottle of burgundy when they do n't know what they are going to end up with , " said mr brook-carter .
" the australian firms have brought wine marketing into the 21st century , creating brands in an industry that just did n't have them before . "
one key element in this marketing is labelling : australia was the pioneer of branding wines by grape variety - shiraz , merlot , cabernet sauvignon and so on - rather than place of origin .
" it 's much more user-friendly , " said ms park .
market research also indicates that british consumers feel more comfortable with the simple anglicised brand names of new world wines , than with the tongue-twisting names of chateaux and vineyards .
new wine in new bottles the next step in this process could be even more radical still .
with most established wine markets close to saturation , producers are hoping to open up virgin segments .
brl hardy is gunning for the fledgling us wine market , where wine is increasingly being marketed as something close to a health product .
earlier this year , australian producer iws launched swaying willow , the world 's first diet chardonnay .
firms have also turned their attention to the youth segment , worried by indications that consumers in their teens and twenties strongly prefer beer and spirits .
brl hardy has introduced a wackily-packaged range called wicked wines , which are aimed at clubbers .
" it 's an extension of attitude and a state of emotion , " says wicked wines ' promotional literature .
according to mr brook-carter , iconoclastic producers are also looking to change many traditional aspects of wine , such as uniform bottle size , glass packaging , corks and the need for careful storage .
europe fights back traditional producers are starting to take note .
the french distillers ' society is trialling a form of powdered wine for pharmaceutical use , hoping to cash in on news that moderate wine consumption is good for the heart .
tired established european wine brands , such as german blue nun and piat d 'or , french-produced but bottled in britain , are being repackaged and relaunched .
and the french may have the last laugh .
while multinational firms are battling for the middle market as global demand falls , top french producers still dominate the ultra-premium sector .
after a highly acclaimed 2000 vintage , that is a lucrative position to be in .
advance prices - known in the trade as en primeur - for the best 2000 bordeaux wines are up as much as 100 % on last year .
