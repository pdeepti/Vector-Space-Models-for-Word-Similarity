the 22 hi-tech urban patrol bikes have been specially developed for police use with blue flashing lights and a siren .
the mountain bikes , which sport a police livery , were bought after trials in the region showed that police on cycles were well-received by the public .
chief superintendent geoff rees , commander at thornhill road operational command unit , said : " the aim of the bikes is to increase the visibility and profile of the police in the community .
" trials in handsworth have proved that the general public are very happy to approach police on bikes and these strong , yet lightweight vehicles are ideal for policing high density residential areas . "
following the success of the trials , a grant to purchase the bikes was obtained from the single regeneration budget 4 through the handsworth community safety team .
officers using the bikes will also wear a specially designed protective uniform partly supplied by local companies .
the cyclists will be demonstrating the new bikes and uniform to the local community on tuesday when they ride in a convoy from thornhill road police station to handsworth park .

the power-sharing executive 's second budget is to be revealed following the publication of the draft legislative programme for government on monday .
mr durkan has more than £ 6bn to allocate between the assembly 's ten departments - an increase of around 7 % on last year 's budget .
following weeks of negotiations with his fellow ministers , mr durkan will bring his spending plans before the assembly .
competing demands with competing demands for more funding from many of the assembly 's cash-strapped departments , the £ 6bn has given mr durkan only limited room for manouevre .
education and health are expected to be allocated about half of the total budget between them .
the department of health is expected to get increased funding of about 8 % , a slight increase on last year 's rise .
the programme for government focused particularly on improving public transport and some sections of the province 's roads infrastructure and the budget will reflect that .
there have been persistent complaints that these areas have been underfunded over many years .
on monday , acting first minister sir reg empey said £ 40m would be made available to fund the upgrading of the westlink in belfast , complete the dualling scheme on the a8 road from belfast to larne , and to dual part of the northern ireland section of the newry to dundalk road - on the main route from belfast to dublin .
once again the one department likely to see little increase in its budget is enterprise .
the better economic performance of recent years has meant there has been less requirement for government support for business enterprise .
ni grant concerns as expected , it will not have been possible to meet all ministerial demands for spending .
mr durkan has been critical in the past of the way the uk government works out how northern ireland 's grant is allocated .
he has argued that the province loses out under the system used to decide how much is given from the central purse .
the assembly - if it remains in place - will have three months to consider the budget - before final decisions are made in december .
the draft programme for government and the budget are being published at a time of deep political uncertainty in the province .
northern ireland secretary john reid averted the assembly 's collapse by suspending it for 24 hours at the weekend .
this has created another six-week period in which the parties could come to agreement on issues blocking the political process including ira decommissioning and british government demilitarisation .
however , both the ulster unionists and dup are attempting to gain enough support to table motions to exclude sinn fein from the powersharing government because of the ira 's refusal to disarm .
sinn fein president gerry adams responded to the moves by saying these were the exactly the kind of actions which would make the prospect of decommissioning even more remote .

the assembly - if it remains in place - will have three months to consider the budget - before final decisions are made in december .
the draft programme for government and the budget are being published at a time of deep political uncertainty in the province .
northern ireland secretary john reid averted the assembly 's collapse by suspending it for 24 hours at the weekend .
this has created another six-week period in which the parties could come to agreement on issues blocking the political process including ira decommissioning and british government demilitarisation .
however , both the ulster unionists and dup are attempting to gain enough support to table motions to exclude sinn fein from the powersharing government because of the ira 's refusal to disarm .
sinn fein president gerry adams responded to the moves by saying these were the exactly the kind of actions which would make the prospect of decommissioning even more remote .

the new laws are being debated in the senate , the upper house of parliament , though debate is probably too strong a word because the labour party opposition is supporting the government at every step .
the laws will reinforce australia 's authority to turn boats away from australia and impose mandatory prison sentences on the crews of boats which do cross the border .
boat people coming through indonesia will be denied permanent residence even if they prove to be genuine refugees .
some of these restrictions will apply to people coming through christmas island and other popular landing places off the north-west coast .
the laws , which will come into force later this week , will confirm australia 's right to send these people to another country such as the pacific island of nauru to be dealt with by the united nations .
and an overriding law will deny all these people access to the courts to challenge government actions or decisions .
australia 's hard line against boat people has strong popular support though some minor political parties are describing the new laws as repressive and abominable .

i do n't want people talking themselves into something which , at this moment , is n't actually there digby jones digby jones said the fundamentals of britain 's economy were holding up well and companies were in better shape than ever before to weather a slowdown .
he blamed the media - and financial journalists - for spreading gloom about the economy .
speaking on bbc breakfast , mr jones said : " the financial reporting seems to be saying that things are going down , but actually the fundamentals of people 's businesses - the turnover , the activity , the orders , are holding up across sectors . "
' obvious slowdown ' mr jones , who is due to address the liberal democrat conference later on tuesday , went on : " our big worry is that britain might just be talking itself into something that , there at the coal face and in the high street , is n't actually happening . "
mr jones conceded that the cbi 's own industrial trends survey has consistently showed signs of an economic slowdown .
" no-one is saying there has n't been a slowdown , but the fundamentals of the uk economy are very good , " he said .
' quality of lending ' " we have low interest rates , low unemployment and low inflation , " mr jones added .
" companies are in much better shape than in any other slowdown , in ' 91 and ' 81 .
" the quality of the lending book is better , there is not that high gearing . "
he added : " we are in much better shape to deal with what 's ahead than we have ever been before .
" there is a big difference between slowdown , and challenging times , and recession and i do n't want people talking themselves into something which , at this moment , is n't actually there . "
bank of england view mr jones said a lot of the job cuts announced in the united states in recent days would have been in the pipeline before the tragic events in washington and new york .
but his words were in contrast to the governor of the bank of england , sir edward george , who said it was " too soon to say " if britain would avoid a recession . "
giving the clearest indication yet that britain might be on the brink of a major downturn , mr george said : " the overall impression , at this stage , is that we will see some weakening in the current quarter and perhaps in the next quarter . "
the generally accepted definition of a recession is two quarters of negative growth .

yet few indicators are as potentially deceptive - or as economically crucial .
consumer behaviour is like an oil tanker : it can take a very long time to turn around peter lunt , university college london over the next few days , number-crunchers in the us , britain and around the world will release the first statistical measurements of how consumer confidence has changed since the us attacks of 11 september .
almost everywhere , these figures are expected to show a catastrophic-seeming plunge in sentiment .
but just how catastrophic is the collapse in confidence , and how much real effect does it have on our economic fortunes ?
shopping : your patriotic duty consumer spending is certainly the foundation of many economies .
the long boom of the mid to late 1990s was built on buoyant spending - especially in the us and uk , where service industries have long replaced manufacturing as the main economic motor .
the best way to support the economy similarly , the predicted slump in consumer spending is seen as the main threat now , as the us attacks crunched into an already-vulnerable global economy .
policy-makers , especially in the us , have queued up to urge consumers to get back to the shops .
this vital economic role has pushed the various indicators of consumer confidence into a leading position among investors ' numbers to watch .
in the us , every blip and dip of the university of michigan 's monthly consumer survey - the next release of which is due out on friday - is chewed over obsessively by market pundits .
lies , damned lies and statistics but just how important are these confidence numbers ?
although no one questions the statistical rigour of the michigan survey , or of its equivalents elsewhere in the world , experts counsel caution when jumping to economic conclusions .
first , consumer confidence is what economists call a lagging , rather than leading indicator .
" consumer behaviour is like an oil tanker : it can take a very long time to turn around , " says peter lunt , a senior lecturer in economic psychology at university college london .
that is partly because consumers do not necessarily have the full range of economic information , either out of ignorance or because they are sceptical of what they hear from the media .
and the confidence lag is also a function of the fact that consumers can not turn their economic habits around overnight .
most consumers ramp up their debt during a boom period , for example , and are rarely nimble enough to pay it off quickly when the climate takes a turn for the worse .
things change and the role of consumer confidence may also have changed since it first started to be calculated in the 1950s .
shopping was very different then then , the key psychological element in confidence was stability , especially in employment and welfare provision .
now , mr lunt says many younger consumers are happy to have a little instability , because it offers possibilities as well as drawbacks .
an unstable labour market , for example , may mean people fear being sacked , but it also offers the chance for profitable job-hopping .
this increase in " risk-seeking " behaviour , economists say , means that unconfident consumers are not necessarily unhappy ones .
and while people may well be better-informed these days about general economic issues , they are also generally less concerned about society as a whole .
" as the old collective notions give way to more nuanced , individual thinking , the whole issue of confidence is much harder to predict , " says mr lunt .
strange times yet another unguessable variable is the fact that the present situation is highly out of the ordinary .
a drop in consumer confidence almost never causes a simple drop in consumer spending gerrit antonides , erasmus university no one , sadly , has done any analysis on how consumer sentiment tends to react to one-off tragic shocks .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that a blast of bad news - the death of princess diana in the uk , for example , or the assassination of us president john f kennedy - has a marked effect on spending .
in one of the few consumer surveys to have been completed since the attacks , the consumer board , a us analysis firm , found that a surprisingly small 10 % of americans were planning to cut back on spending .
" while nearly 90 % of consumers say they will not cut back on their buying plans , it 's important to note that this figure is very likely to fall as widespread layoffs begin to materialize , " says lynn franco , director of the conference board 's consumer research center .
bounce back soon but strip out the existing troubles of the global economy , and the emotional effects of the attacks will not last - at least in markets some distance from the scene of the attacks .
" the effect -lsb- of the us attacks -rsb- on consumer spending can only be temporary , " says gerrit antonides , professor of economic psychology at erasmus university in rotterdam .
that is mainly , of course , because the post-event dip in sentiment is in many cases irrational , albeit understandable .
as even new york gets back to work , and the media coverage eases , daily economic realities eventually exert themselves again .
back to the recession none of this avoids the fact that the world economy was pretty much heading towards recession before the attacks , so consumer confidence could have been expected to take a tumble in any case .
the september report from michigan university , calculated ahead of the attacks , showed that confidence had fallen to its lowest point in nearly a decade , mirroring falls during the recessions of the early 1990s and late 1970s .
but if consumers do become more gloomy , the results may not be entirely predictable .
" a drop in consumer confidence almost never causes a simple drop in consumer spending , " says mr antonides .
spending differently , not less what it does produce , says mr antonides , is a fall in spending on durables ; consumers put off upgrading their car , or buying a new washing machine .
buying a new car may no longer seem so tempting at the same time , they do not take on heavy levels of credit , and at least start to think about ramping up their savings .
other goods benefit , notably " comfort products " - everything from chocolate and alcohol all the way through to books and home furnishings .
overall , the amount of money passing through cash tills may not change that much - a fact that makes the wholesale sell-off of consumer-oriented shares seem something of an over-reaction .
indeed , a little judicious spending , psychologists reckon , can be a great comfort to consumers at a time of stress .

yet few indicators are as potentially deceptive - or as economically crucial . "
consumer behaviour is like an oil tanker : it can take a very long time to turn around " peter lunt , university college london over the next few days , number-crunchers in the us , britain and around the world will release the first statistical measurements of how consumer confidence has changed since the us attacks of 11 september .
almost everywhere , these figures are expected to show a catastrophic-seeming plunge in sentiment .
but just how catastrophic is the collapse in confidence , and how much real effect does it have on our economic fortunes ?
shopping : your patriotic duty consumer spending is certainly the foundation of many economies .
the long boom of the mid to late 1990s was built on buoyant spending - especially in the us and uk , where service industries have long replaced manufacturing as the main economic motor .
similarly , the predicted slump in consumer spending is seen as the main threat now , as the us attacks crunched into an already-vulnerable global economy .
policy-makers , especially in the us , have queued up to urge consumers to get back to the shops .
this vital economic role has pushed the various indicators of consumer confidence into a leading position among investors ' numbers to watch .
in the us , every blip and dip of the university of michigan 's monthly consumer survey - the next release of which is due out on friday - is chewed over obsessively by market pundits .
lies , damned lies and statistics but just how important are these confidence numbers ?
although no one questions the statistical rigour of the michigan survey , or of its equivalents elsewhere in the world , experts counsel caution when jumping to economic conclusions .
first , consumer confidence is what economists call a lagging , rather than leading indicator .
" consumer behaviour is like an oil tanker : it can take a very long time to turn around , " says peter lunt , a senior lecturer in economic psychology at university college london .
that is partly because consumers do not necessarily have the full range of economic information , either out of ignorance or because they are sceptical of what they hear from the media .
and the confidence lag is also a function of the fact that consumers can not turn their economic habits around overnight .
most consumers ramp up their debt during a boom period , for example , and are rarely nimble enough to pay it off quickly when the climate takes a turn for the worse .
things change and the role of consumer confidence may also have changed since it first started to be calculated in the 1950s .
then , the key psychological element in confidence was stability , especially in employment and welfare provision .
now , mr lunt says many younger consumers are happy to have a little instability , because it offers possibilities as well as drawbacks .
an unstable labour market , for example , may mean people fear being sacked , but it also offers the chance for profitable job-hopping .
this increase in " risk-seeking " behaviour , economists say , means that unconfident consumers are not necessarily unhappy ones .
and while people may well be better-informed these days about general economic issues , they are also generally less concerned about society as a whole .
" as the old collective notions give way to more nuanced , individual thinking , the whole issue of confidence is much harder to predict , " says mr lunt .
strange times yet another unguessable variable is the fact that the present situation is highly out of the ordinary . "
a drop in consumer confidence almost never causes a simple drop in consumer spending " gerrit antonides , erasmus university no one , sadly , has done any analysis on how consumer sentiment tends to react to one-off tragic shocks .
anecdotal evidence , however , suggests that a blast of bad news - the death of princess diana in the uk , for example , or the assassination of us president john f kennedy - has a marked effect on spending .
in one of the few consumer surveys to have been completed since the attacks , the consumer board , a us analysis firm , found that a surprisingly small 10 % of americans were planning to cut back on spending .
" while nearly 90 % of consumers say they will not cut back on their buying plans , it 's important to note that this figure is very likely to fall as widespread layoffs begin to materialize , " says lynn franco , director of the conference board 's consumer research center .
bounce back soon but strip out the existing troubles of the global economy , and the emotional effects of the attacks will not last - at least in markets some distance from the scene of the attacks .
" the effect -lsb- of the us attacks -rsb- on consumer spending can only be temporary , " says gerrit antonides , professor of economic psychology at erasmus university in rotterdam .
that is mainly , of course , because the post-event dip in sentiment is in many cases irrational , albeit understandable .
as even new york gets back to work , and the media coverage eases , daily economic realities eventually exert themselves again .
back to the recession none of this avoids the fact that the world economy was pretty much heading towards recession before the attacks , so consumer confidence could have been expected to take a tumble in any case .
the september report from michigan university , calculated ahead of the attacks , showed that confidence had fallen to its lowest point in nearly a decade , mirroring falls during the recessions of the early 1990s and late 1970s .
but if consumers do become more gloomy , the results may not be entirely predictable .
" a drop in consumer confidence almost never causes a simple drop in consumer spending , " says mr antonides .
spending differently , not less what it does produce , says mr antonides , is a fall in spending on durables ; consumers put off upgrading their car , or buying a new washing machine .
at the same time , they do not take on heavy levels of credit , and at least start to think about ramping up their savings .
other goods benefit , notably " comfort products " - everything from chocolate and alcohol all the way through to books and home furnishings .
overall , the amount of money passing through cash tills may not change that much - a fact that makes the wholesale sell-off of consumer-oriented shares seem something of an over-reaction .
indeed , a little judicious spending , psychologists reckon , can be a great comfort to consumers at a time of stress .
retail therapy may not just be good for the economy , it could be good for you too .

stock market investments have had a torrid time over the past year , but the attacks in america have caused further uncertainty - and millions of homeowners are relying on equity-based investments to pay off their mortgage .
switching to repayment mortgage is the only way to guarantee that it will be paid at the end of the term david hollingworth of london & country anyone who has taken out an endowment , individual savings account -lrb- isa -rrb- or personal equity plan -lrb- pep -rrb- to pay off their mortgage is being urged to review their investments in the light of recent events .
tough times about three million homeowners have endowment mortgages .
they have already been informed if their policy is not on track and , likely to have a shortfall , if it does not grow by more than 6 % a year .
people who need their policies to grow between 4 % and 6 % have been reassured that they should be able to build up sufficient funds to pay off their mortgage .
however , insurers are only obliged to inform their investors every two years if they are on course to pay of their home loan .
experts are now warning that if markets continue to fall , people may be forced to reassess their investments .
while the endowment fiasco has been well documented , there is also concern for people who are paying into equity isas or peps to pay off their mortgages since they are also relying on stock market performance .
mortgage choice if you take out an interest-only mortgage , you will pay only the mortgage interest each month .
to pay off the capital debt , you must build up sufficient funds to pay off this sum at the end of the term .
the most popular way of doing this is through an endowment , isa or pep .
what should i do ?
if you have got an endowment , you should have been informed by your policy provider of the projected value of the fund .
if you have a pep or isa , there is no similar scheme but you should receive an annual statement outlining the fund 's growth .
some market analysts are predicting growth as little as between 1 % and 2 % this year , which falls far short of most projections .
if you have got a shortfall , you can either top up your existing policy , put money into a different investment , or switch part of the whole of your mortgage into a repayment deal .
experts advise people to steer clear of topping up their policy or investing in another equity-based investment because of current market conditions .
time to switch ?
david hollingworth of london & country , a mortgage broker , said : " switching to repayment mortgage is the only way to guarantee that it will be paid at the end of the term . "
you do not need to switch all your mortgage into a repayment deal - only the shortfall if you wish .
the other advantage is that mortgage rates are so low .
this means that you may even save money , especially those people who are paying a high rate of interest .
for example , someone paying into a £ 100,000 interest-only mortgage at 6.5 % who switches £ 20,000 into a repayment deal at 4.89 % could save £ 84.89 each month .
they would also have the reassurance that the underlying capital was being paid off each month .
