the ulster unionist party leader 's resignation came into effect at midnight on saturday as his deadline for decommissioning by the ira on 30 june elapsed .
his move means that the future of the northern ireland 's peace process has been thrown into uncertainty .
mr trimble announced his decision to resign at the northern ireland assembly on 8 may , when he told assembly colleagues that he would not continue in office if the ira failed to deliver on decommissioning their weapons .
on saturday , mr trimble nominated party colleague and trade minister sir reg empey to fulfil the administrative functions of the office of first minister .
the assembly now has six weeks to re-install mr trimble or replace him before the devolved institutions collapse under legislation brought in under the good friday agreement .
sir reg said his party leader had no choice but to resign as others failed to live up to their commitments and that he would not be leading his party into further talks with sinn fein , until the ira began to disarm .
prime minister tony blair said he was sorry to hear of mr trimble 's resignation but hoped he would soon be reinstated as first minister .
further talks aimed at finding a way through the current impasse in the peace process are due to be held next week .
similar talks held in recent weeks have failed to move the stalled process forward .
speaking ahead of the next stage of negotiations , sir reg said his party would not be re-entering government with sinn fein " without ira arms up front " .
he said : " as far as i am concerned we have been down that road , we have tried our best , and it is perfectly clear that unless people are prepared to honour their commitments we are certainly not going into the breach a third time . "
jeffrey donaldson , a member of the uup talks team , said he believed mr trimble 's resignation was " essential to bring the decommissioning issue to a head " .
the peace process will now be tested as never before jeffrey donaldson " the peace process will now be tested as never before in terms of establishing whether the ira are committed to peace or whether they want to hold on to the weapons of war , " he said .
mr trimble will lose the trappings of office - power , chauffeur-driven car , attendants and title .
his decision to resign has also put the deputy first minister , seamus mallon , out of office .
the two ministers are elected jointly and though the sdlp leader has lost his office , he may continue to carry out the duties of deputy first minister until both posts are re-elected in the next six weeks .
the ira are demanding changes to the policing legislation and demilitarisation as the price of disarmament .
if a deal is negotiated in the coming weeks , it will need to be approved by a majority of unionist and nationalist assembly members .

" there were hardly any discussions on specific issues ...
what we wanted to do first was for the leaders to establish a strong relationship , " a senior japanese official said after the talks on saturday .
there 's no question in my mind our relationship will never be stronger than under our leadership george w bush mr bush and mr koizumi failed to make substantive progress on security issues and the environment .
but the summit in maryland - the leaders ' first meeting - did establish " a strong relationship of trust , " said mr koizumi .
the occasion did not appear to be marred by the recent alleged rape of a japanese woman by us servicemen on the island of okinawa .
playing ball there are deep differences between japan and the us over defence and the environment .
but as president bush backed japan 's tough economic reform programme , mr koizumi stepped back from tough criticism of the us president 's stance on the kyoto treaty on climate change .
i did not ... believe that i would be able to establish such a strong relationship of trust with the president in my first meeting junichiro koizumi speaking after the talks , mr koizumi said he still hoped for discussion of the issue despite the us refusal to push for ratification of kyoto , which japan supports .
" i am not disappointed at the president 's position , " he said .
" there is still time to discuss the issue . "
just a week ago , mr koizumi described mr bush 's position - that the treaty is flawed and unfair to us companies - as " deplorable " .
support for reform the two leaders also agreed to " consult closely " on another contentious issue - missile defence .
and mr bush offered his support for japan 's economic reform programme , saying there was no danger of it hurting the us economy .
" i want to praise the prime minister for his vision of reform , " he said .
" he is willing to make difficult choices .
the summit had risked being overshadowed by the alleged rape of a woman by us servicemen in okinawa , but mr koizumi declined to discuss the incident until the police investigation was completed .
a us serviceman is being questioned by japanese police .
he denies raping the woman .
okinawa is home to most of the 50,000 us servicemen based in japan .
their presence has become increasingly controversial , with a series of highly publicised crimes in recent years .
international newcomer there are fears that the case could trigger still more anti-american sentiment if us military personnel are found to be involved .
mr bush expressed " deep regret " over the okinawa incident .
but he said it was difficult to accept a japanese demand to set a 15-year time limit on the use of a planned military airport which will partly replace an existing air base .
the bbc 's correspondent in tokyo , charles scanlon , says the japanese are likely to be impressed with mr koizumi 's international debut .
it was an assured , self-confident performance , our correspondent says , during which mr koizumi was prepared to state his differences with the us .
the summit is the first leg of a three-stop tour by mr koizumi .
he will head on to london and paris on sunday .

the centenarian says the secret of a long and happy life is to keep busy and refuse to retire .
and lady hilda continues to practice what she preaches by working as a volunteer for the national trust for scotland -lrb- nts -rrb- .
the teetotal non-smoker is a volunteer guide at edinburgh 's georgian house .
my motto is never say die - and i think i 'm living up to it lady hilda morton she said : " if i were doing what people think i should be doing , i 'd be sitting doing nothing - waiting to die .
it 's as simple as that .
" but my motto is never say die - and i think i 'm living up to it . "
she started work as an ambulance driver in world war two , and motoring and volunteering have been her life 's passions .

as in the case of the three gorges dam concerns have been raised about its environmental impact the dam , in china 's south-western guangxi region , will cost around $ 3.2bn and will take eight years to complete .
an estimated 75,000 people will be moved to make way for the project , which is second in size only to the giant three gorges dam on the yangtze river .
it will be an important source of power for china , but as in the case of the three gorges dam - the world 's largest - concerns have been raised about its environmental impact .
national grid the new dam will be built at longtan on the hongshui river - a tributary of the pearl river which flows into the sea near hong kong .
it is one of 10 new hydroelectric dams planned for the river .
china is seeking to create a national electricity grid to harness energy in the resource-rich but sparsely populated south-west , and transfer it to the densely populated east coast .
the project is also a key part of government plans to develop western china .
deprived area officials hope the dam , which will generate its first electricity in 2007 , will bring economic benefits to guangxi , one of the country 's poorest regions .
there is no foreign funding for the project - money has been raised by power companies in guangxi and neighbouring guizhou province .
as with the much larger three gorges dam currently being built on the yangtze river to the north , officials say this project will help with flood control and improve upstream navigation .
environmentally unsound but local officials quoted by china 's state media have said the dam could lead to the silting up of the river .
china is trying to develop its impoverished west , including tibet they say deforestation in the area has caused severe erosion and power stations downstream are already facing serious problems because of silting , and they warn that insufficient funds have been set aside to tackle the problem .
environmentalists and , more recently , some delegates to china 's legislature have issued similar warnings about the three gorges project , which will start generating electricity in 2003 .
its final cost is officially put at more than $ 21bn dollars .
the three gorges project has also been dogged by corruption in the relocation of more than one million people to make way for the dam .

after exactly three years as first minister , david trimble 's patience has finally snapped .
he is known to have a short fuse , and like most northern ireland politicians , is not afraid to raise his voice .
what is more , he often gives the impression of a man in a hurry .
on the morning in may when he announced that he intended resigning , he was seen sprinting down a corridor at stormont in a last-minute rush to inform the deputy first minister , seamus mallon , about his decision .
so was this a hurried , impetuous decision ?
a knee-jerk reaction from a man under pressure ?
apparently not .
the decision to resign had in fact been taken two months previously , during a private conversation with a close colleague during a trip to the united states .
mr trimble made up his mind there and then that if there was no decommissioning by the end of june , he would leave office .
this , he calculated , would leave the ira and sinn fein with a straight choice - devolution or decommissioning .
boiling tempers it may have been a cool and calm decision , but mr trimble 's mood in recent days has been less than serene .
during last week 's negotiations at hillsborough castle , he struggled to keep his composure when confronted with questions about the exact implications of his resignation .
his face became redder , the volume in his tone increased and so did the finger-wagging .
he is not the first politician to get hot under the collar during the recent negotiations - and he will not be the last .
the list of politicians who have been grumpy with the media in the past month reads like a ' who 's who ' of northern ireland politics .
ian paisley , john hume , seamus mallon , gerry adams and martin mcguinness have all had spats with interviewers .
it is part of everyday life in the world of politics .
for mr trimble , being first minister used to be part of everyday life , but not any more .
he was elected to the post on 1 july 1998 ; he resigned on 1 july 2001 .
light at the end of the tunnel ?
it all started three years ago with a smile and a handshake between him and seamus mallon on a glorious summer 's afternoon .
it ended in darkness at midnight on saturday .
mr trimble still sees a light at the end of the tunnel - the possibility that the ira will soon start to decommission .
after three years rushing around , he is now sitting back and waiting .

the minister told the bbc that the travelling public were fed up of people not accepting responsibility for the failings of the railways .
mr byers told the bbc 's breakfast with frost programme that the situation on the railways was " grim " but that the answer was not to renationalise the railways .
things have been grim as far as the railways are concerned and the travelling public know that transport secretary stephen byers instead he said he would be announcing within weeks how the government would use its powers to ensure that improvements were carried out .
he said better co-operation between the train operators and railtrack would be encouraged .
' no tube privatisation ' the transport secretary also stressed that london underground would not be privatised while he was transport secretary .
" i think you are right to say things have been grim as far as the railways are concerned and the travelling public know that , " he said .
" people have been tolerant but now they are pretty fed up with the industry blaming other people , and not taking responsibility themselves - that 's got to change , " said mr byers .
while there was a tendency to look at the past " with rose tinted spectacles " the shortcomings of british rail as the public deserted the railways should not be forgotten , he said .
byers : i must turn things around on the railways the government would concentrate on ensuring that the strategic rail authority implemented its 10 year plan of transport improvements .
" this will make a real difference which will be noticed by the travelling public , " he said .
he continued that in his new role he would examine the system of franchising of services .
he said railtrack needed to provide a railway network which they were not doing at the moment .
and mr byers called on railtrack to meet with the train operating companies as a matter of urgency .
funding boost and he said the bid from railtrack for Â£ 1.5m of government funding would be considered carefully .
" it needs to be money that will drive up standards for the travelling public , " he said .
mr byers refused to comment on former railtrack chief executive gerald corbett 's Â£ 860,000 " severance package " saying that this was a matter for the shareholders .
on other transport issues , he said that the public would not be prepared to accept " excessive " petrol price rises but that the level of fuel duty would be partly determined by the decisions of opec -lrb- the organisation of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- .
mr byers categorically stated that there would no privatisation of the london underground while he was transport secretary .
he said that did not rule out private investment but this must remain under public control .
and when the new transport secretary was asked if he now planned to learn how to drive , he replied that he had reached the age of 48 without doing so but might consider it when he had more time .

" people have been tolerant but now they are pretty fed up with the industry blaming other people , and not taking responsibility themselves - that 's got to change , " said mr byers .
while there was a tendency to look at the past " with rose tinted spectacles " the shortcomings of british rail as the public deserted the railways should not be forgotten , he said .
the government would concentrate on ensuring that the strategic rail authority implemented its 10 year plan of transport improvements .
" this will make a real difference which will be noticed by the travelling public , " he said .
he continued that in his new role he would examine the system of franchising of services .
he said railtrack needed to provide a railway network which they were not doing at the moment .
and mr byers called on railtrack to meet with the train operating companies as a matter of urgency .
funding boost and he said the bid from railtrack for Â£ 1.5m of government funding would be considered carefully .
" it needs to be money that will drive up standards for the travelling public , " he said .
mr byers refused to comment on former railtrack chief executive gerald corbett 's Â£ 860,000 " severance package " saying that this was a matter for the shareholders .
on other transport issues , he said that the public would not be prepared to accept " excessive " petrol price rises but that the level of fuel duty would be partly determined by the decisions of opec -lrb- the organisation of petroleum exporting countries -rrb- .
mr byers categorically stated that there would no privatisation of the london underground while he was transport secretary .
he said that did not rule out private investment but this must remain under public control .
and when the new transport secretary was asked if he now planned to learn how to drive , he replied that he had reached the age of 48 without doing so but might consider it when he had more time .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- woolworths float in balance low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo sunday , 1 july , 2001 , 11:32 gmt 12:32 uk woolworths float in balance corbett : nearly resigned - will he now be pushed ?
the flotation of woolworths is in doubt because of disputes among management over who is to run the business , newspaper reports have said .
at the centre of the row is the future of gerald corbett , the former railtrack boss who faced strong criticism after it emerged two weeks ago that he had accepted a Â£ 900,000 payoff from his last job .
now executive chairman of woolworths , mr corbett was hired to oversee the retail chain 's demerger from its parent company , kingfisher .
but kingfisher chief executive sir geoff mulcahy is known to be uneasy about the prospect of more bad publicity and will on monday decide whether to sack mr corbett at a board meeting , sunday business newspaper reported .
if he does , the Â£ 800m flotation of woolworths will almost certainly be delayed , probably until some time next year , analysts said .
walk-out threat any decision to fire mr corbett would also prompt a showdown with incoming non-executive directors of woolworths , the sunday telegraph reported .
they want him to stay and will threaten to walk out , sinking hopes of a summer flotation , if he is axed , the newspaper said .
according to the sunday telegraph , the chain 's new non-executives include jonathan fry , former chairman of oil company burmah castrol , andrew beeson , co-founder of stockbroker beeson gregory and prue leith , the cookery celebrity and businesswoman .
sunday business said banks backing the demerger were also urging sir geoff to stand by mr corbett .
nearly resigned sources cited by sunday business said the most likely outcome was that mr corbett would be left in place to see through the demerger but would not have his six-month contract - due to expire at the end of august - extended .
original plans had been for mr corbett to become non-executive chairman after the flotation , with day-to-day management passing to a chief executive with greater retail experience .
however , any new plans will have to be acceptable to mr corbett , who nearly resigned last week after sir geoff failed to back him publicly , sunday business said .
it is also not clear how strong a stance the non-executives will take on how long mr corbett should stay .
the sunday times said mr corbett remained popular at woolworths and in the city and was this weekend negotiating a 12-month extension to his contract .
monro hitch the sunday telegraph said that sir geoff also faced difficulties with his choice for woolworths chief executive .
angus monro , formerly matalan chief executive , was reported to be demanding that kingfisher pay out all the share options he held at matalan and also compensate his former employer for agreeing to break his agreement not to join a rival .
