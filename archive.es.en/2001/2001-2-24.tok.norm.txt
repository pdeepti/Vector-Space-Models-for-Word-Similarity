speaking on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the launching of operation desert storm , mr major said any other decision would have violated international law and angered some of the coalition allies .
" i passionately believe the correct decision was taken to stop the war at that time , " mr major told the audience at the texas a & m university .
mr bush , whose son george w has now inherited the presidency , said while he thought the war was well-executed and the right decisions were made , he admitted underestimating the iraqi leader 's " brutal " hold on power .
i honestly thought and so did every arab leader ... that given the pounding saddam hussein took , he could n't survive .
former president george bush " i honestly thought and so did every arab leader ... that given the pounding saddam hussein took , he could n't survive .
" he did , but he did through total brutality of his own people ... we underestimated the tyranny , " mr bush said .
but he added : " i really ca n't think of any fundamental mistakes -lrb- we made -rrb- " .
the former president said the world had to maintain pressure " very , very strongly " on president saddam to comply with international law and the terms of surrender he agreed to at the end of the war .
retired us general and gulf war commander norman schwarzkopf , who joined the two former leaders on the panel , said he had just one regret .
intense bombing he said he wished allied bombers could have destroyed a statue of president saddam which stood in the centre of baghdad .
advisers ruled it out because of the possibility that civilians would be killed but he said : " i really wish we 'd blown that up . "
the allied ground offensive , which followed 38 days of intense bombing of iraqi military positions , lasted just 100 hours before the iraqis surrendered their positions in kuwait .
summing up the importance of the war , mr bush said " it simply made a moral , profound statement " against aggression .
the iraqi leader now poses a problem for mr bush 's son who , with the help of uk forces , launched air strikes on iraq last week , as part of the enforcement of a " no-fly " zone imposed after the gulf war .
critics claim the sanctions imposed on iraq after the gulf war have failed to achieve their aim and have simply led to the deaths of thousands of iraqi children .
but opponents of the sanctions , both in the us and the uk , have failed to undermine london or washington 's commitment to them .

the xerox parc nestles unobtrusively in the lush , north californian countryside .
it was here in the 1970s that a small group of slightly degenerate but startlingly bright hippies helped accelerate the move from gargantuan , punch card-eating hulks into the pcs of today .
walk into rich gould 's office and you can still hear the classic tunes - even california dreaming by the mamas and papas .
gould used to design toys for matell .
now , he is developing the next generation of computers for xerox .
i want computers to disappear , he says , as he bounces around on a beanbag .
that might sound a rather strange aim for the head of a computer research division , but what gould is really talking about is making computers invisible .
earthquake rescue they would be incorporated into everyday objects in a way that we would not realise they were there .
your refrigerator , your car , even your shirt and shoes will have computers in them .
they will speak to each other , they will monitor the world and they will change and react to the things around them .
among the first of these new robot species is a snake-like machine that slithers across a tabletop .
the polybot , as it is known , is made up of a dozen or so 5-centimetre square cubes joined together like lego play bricks .
but unlike lego , these cubes can reassemble themselves .
the polybot can morph into different shapes depending on the size of the obstacles over which it must climb .
as it arrives at some rougher terrain , it stops , polybot creator dave duff explains .
the two ends bend around and meet in the middle where they attach to the centre point .
and then it breaks these two loops and stands up as a four-legged spider .
there is nothing sinister though about dave 's robot spiders .
they could be very friendly , especially if you are caught in an earthquake-collapsed building .
cup or hammer when it arrives at the rubble of a building , the robot will transition either into the snake or the spider to work its way into the building .
then it would use its onboard sensors to map out the interior cavities and search for survivors .
and when it arrived at a person , the polybot would shore up the structures around them .
colleague mark yim is taking the morphing idea to another extreme by trying to program thousands of super-small computers so that they can clump together and rearrange themselves into any shape at all .
they might form a big blob initially and then , if you needed to have a drink , they could reshape themselves into the form of a cup , and you could go and fill it up with tea .
or if you needed a hammer , this cup could then change its shape into a hammer .
if this all sounds a bit pie in the sky , then remember that is precisely what they thought of the idea of a small personal computer all those years ago .
