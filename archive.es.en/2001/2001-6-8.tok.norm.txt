the cuts would affect 1,400 of its employees , mainly in the united states .
the company , which was formerly known as andersen consulting , has blamed the economic slowdown and a low turnover of staff .
" while we had hoped to avoid making any workforce reductions , even temporary ones , the current economic climate and our lower-than-usual attrition levels have created a modest imbalance between the demand for our services and our current staffing levels , " said accenture chief executive joe forehand .
a couple of months ago , the company had said that it had no plans to make any reductions .
' flexleave ' about 800 of the jobs will be laid off through a voluntary sabbatical programme for consulting personnel , called flexleave .
the programme will be open to personnel at the senior-manager level and below with more than 12 months of service .
leave will last six to 12 months , and consultants taking part will receive 20 % of their salaries .
the remaining 600 positions will be eliminated as part of a restructuring .
however , the company also said that it would add 9,000 employees for the year because of overall growth , particularly in europe .
float in april , accenture partners voted " overwhelmingly " to go ahead with an initial public offering of shares to raise up $ 1bn .
the company is expected to be valued at $ 10bn- $ 20bn on the stock market .
andersen consulting was renamed accenture earlier this year after severing its last links with accounting group arthur andersen .
andersen consulting was spun off from arthur andersen in 1989 and quickly began to outgrow its parent .
as of april accenture had 71,000 staff worldwide and reported revenues of more than £ 7bn last year .

the all cash sale is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter , subject to regulatory approval .
bristol-myers , the world 's fifth biggest drugs maker , will acquire a portfolio of medicines that brought in $ 1.5bn in sales last year .

organisers have said they have been told to get specialist maritime insurance cover for the stone - which famously sank during its journey from west wales to stonehenge last year - but so far no-one will take the risk .
the project can only proceed if such insurance cover can be obtained project spokesman len mullins and it appears the controversial £ 100,000 scheme to move the three-tonne rock from north pembrokeshire is once again in doubt .
the millennium bluestone project is sponsored by menter preseli - the rural development initiative - with funding from the heritage lottery fund .
the project was one of many to receive lottery funding to help celebrate the new millennium in wales .
it began more than a year ago , and was due to finish in september 2000 .
but the organisers have become used to setbacks .
" the project is currently unable to gain the specialist maritime insurance cover necessary for the sea stage of the journey , " said spokesman len mullins .
" the project can only proceed if such insurance cover can be obtained .
" the position remains under review but unless insurance cover is available , the project can not proceed . "
efforts to follow in the footsteps of the ancient builders of the famous landmark at salisbury plain have been dogged by bad luck .
the plan had been to recreate the historic journey the builders made 4,000 years ago .
less success they transported the stone 240 miles by land and sea in order to build the monument 's inner circle .
but the 21st century re-run has been less successful .
despite setting off well in april 2000 , problems soon occurred .
first a lack of volunteers delayed plans to drag the stone overland on a wooden sledge .
hauled out then , as the giant boulder was being rowed across the bristol channel on two replica ancient boats , it slipped into the sea off the west wales coast .
bad weather then prevented divers from searching for it .
it was eventually found lying 16.5m underwater near the mouth of the milford haven estuary , and hauled out with the help of volunteers .
but efforts to relaunch the operation - which was due to finish in september 2000 - were abruptly halted when it was discovered the stone would not fit into a newly-adapted boat .
the bluestone project committee has now said it is uncertain where the stone will be placed when it finally arrives in stonehenge .
a spokesman for the committee said it would be " sacrilege " to place it among the other stones at stonehenge , and no decision had been taken about its final resting place .

researchers found that equipment used to kick start the heart is being placed on the wrong parts of the chest .
doctors say this would lead to possible loss of life , unnecessary suffering for patients and delays in resuscitation .
there are moves to introduce defibrillators in public places and aircraft , and to train the public in how to use them .
i think it is probably fair to say we suspect lives may well be being lost dr charles deakin training gap but the research suggests only two in 10 doctors of all grades and specialities know where to place one of the defibrillator paddles and just six out of 10 knew where to place the other .
there are now calls for all doctors to get full training in using the vital equipment .
delays in treatment could be costing lives report author dr charles deakin studied 101 doctors from all grades and specialities at southampton general hospital and said he was " surprised " by the high levels of ignorance in such a critical area .
he said he was sure the lack of knowledge was country-wide .
" i think it is probably fair to say we suspect lives may well be being lost .
" we suspect this is probably affecting the outcome but we have no evidence of this . "
dr deakin said the positioning of the paddles was vital to ensure the correct electrical current was passed through the heart to restart it .
he said if the paddles were placed too far apart there could be delays in getting the heart started and as the current was increased patients could suffer unnecessary skin burns .
he said even the smallest delays could lead to death , with every minute of delay in restoring the normal heart rhythm increasing mortality by between seven and 10 % .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- world sinks into deeper poverty low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 8 june , 2001 , 07:11 gmt 08:11 uk world sinks into deeper poverty a malian child - one of the poorest nations in the world the world 's poor may be sinking deeper into poverty , according to a new report by a top economics professor that turns traditional insights into poverty reduction upside down .
the indian sub-continent and sub-saharan africa - two of the poorest regions of the world which make up around a third of the world 's population - have really become poorer over the past decades , according to the research .
the implications of these results should be heart-breaking professor partha dasgupta this is in stark contrast to the much more widely used - and potentially misleading - data based on gross national product -lrb- gnp -rrb- and the human development index .
and the belief that the economies of the poorest countries are growing may , in some cases , have led to less aid , development loans or grants .
" the implications of these results should be heart-breaking , " concluded partha dasgupta , a professor of economics at cambridge university and the former president of the royal economic society .
deteriorating natural resources governments , development organisations and the world bank use gnp to gauge the rate of growth of a certain country 's economy .
but the measure of gnp - the monetary value of all goods and services provided by the economy - could be fatally flawed as it disregards vitally important factors such as the deterioration of natural resources .
average change in gnp per head , 1965-1996 bangladesh 1 % india 2.3 % nepal 1 % pakistan 2.7 % china 6.7 % sub-sahara africa -0.2 % average change in wealth per head , 1970-1993 bangladesh -2.6 % india -0.1 % nepal -3 % pakistan -1.9 % sub-sahara africa -3.4 % china 0.8 % gnp may , for example , be rising healthily due to a booming diamond trade .
but if those diamond mines are going to run out in a couple of years time , then the prospects of poverty reduction are falling rather than growing .
the depletion of natural assets such as forests , water , oil , fisheries , soil and minerals will have a dramatic impact on the survival ability of the future generations .
" gnp is by definition insensitive to the depreciation of capital assets , including natural capital , and can mislead hopelessly , " said the report .
" it is totally insensitive to the future , " professor dasgupta told bbc news online .
nations in decline if the decline of natural capital is included under a new measure - which the report dubs wealth per head - traditional insights into poverty reduction are turned upside down .
it reveals that sub-sahara africa , bangladesh , nepal , india and pakistan are all heading into deeper gloom and poverty .
while this is not surprising in the case of sub-saharan africa which is widely known to have regressed in terms of many socio-economic indicators , the figures for the indian subcontinent are shocking .
pakistan 's gnp , for example , grew at a healthy 2.7 % per year , implying a more than doubling of living standards between 1965 and 1996 .
but the alternative measure of wealth shows that living standards have actually almost halved over this period .
blowing natural resources of course , misleading data tends to lead to the introduction of misleading policies .
gnp is totally insensitive to the future professor partha dasgupta the assumption that a steady growth in gnp automatically leads to a reduction in poverty could have led to a decrease in the amount of development aid allocated to any one country .
in addition , some welfare economists claim that structural reforms required by the world bank and the international monetary fund have sometimes led to a speeding up of the decline in natural resources .
the temptation to blow natural resources is high for some countries when they struggle to increase gnp after taxes and subsidies have been removed .
the emphasis on trying to increase any one nation 's gnp could be increasing the pressure to destroy future resources .
some countries for example , have boosted timber exports in order to raise export quotas without taking into account the future implications of deforestation .
the measure of gnp has already come under attack for a number of different reasons .
while some say that it is soulless , others point out that it gives no indication of the rich-poor divides within a country .

the decision contrasts with other countries around the world which have been cutting interest rates to counter a global economic slowdown .
pridiyathorn devakula , appointed as the new governor of the central bank last week , said the increase will " stabilize the baht " .
the thai currency has fallen by 13.4 % in the past year .
monetary policy dispute the former governor of the central bank chatu mongol sonakul was sacked after prime minister thaksin shinawatra said he was not satisfied with the bank 's policy of keeping interest rates low .
chatu mongol sonakul was respected internationally and his departure raised questions about the independence of the central bank .
previously , the central bank had been keeping interest rates low to help revive thailand 's economy .
many investors say the rate rise will hinder the country 's efforts to recover from the 1997 asian financial crisis .
the crisis was sparked after thailand failed to defend a decline in the value of the baht .
baht strengthens the baht strengthened as much as 0.4 % to 44.97 to the dollar after the rate increase was announced .
it recently traded at 45.08 .
the currency has gained more than 1 % since mr pridiyathorn was named governor on may 29 .
the prime minister hinted that further rises in the interest rates could follow .
he defended criticism of thailand 's monetary policy by saying that rates still remain low .
earlier in the week , governor pridiyathorn had said the thai economy was expected to grow between 2.5 % and 3.5 % in 2001 .
