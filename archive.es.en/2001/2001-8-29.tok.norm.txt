however , the government 's deputy chief medical officer says that the issue has already been extensively researched both at home and abroad .
a survey for the bbc radio 4 's today programme found while three-quarters of parents thought the mmr vaccine was safe , more than six out of 10 said parents should have the option of separate jabs for their children .
mmr is a combined vaccine giving protection against measles , mumps and rubella .
survey results 73 % of parents believe mmr is safe 63 % of parents believe they should have the option of their child having separate vaccines for mmr 79 % of parents believe there should be a public inquiry to establish whether there is a link between the mmr vaccine and autism 65 % of parents have allowed their children to be vaccinated using mmr vaccine but some research has linked the vaccine to an increased risk of autism and bowel disorders - although large scale studies have failed to find any link between mmr and ill health .
campaigners say it is wrong that parents in the uk are not given the option of three separate jabs for the different conditions .
in rare cases , measles can kill children or leave them severely disabled .
the department of health - which is backed by the overwhelming majority of medical opinion - has stressed the combined vaccine poses no health risk to children .
studies commissioned by the department of health , the world health organization and public bodies in america have rejected any link between the mmr and disorders such as autism .
officials say that children are at increased risk of disease if their parents opt for separate vaccines because of the time lag involved .
they have also warned that if children are not immunised with mmr in sufficient numbers the risk of a measles epidemic is sharply increased .
repeated assurances however , despite repeated public assurances about the safety of the combined vaccine , it seems that some parents still continue to harbour doubts .
gillian brockley , from connah 's quay , north wales , chose to travel 125 miles to worcester so that her daughter could have separate vaccines .
she said : " it should be the parents ' choice .
if they want it all in one go then fine , but if they do n't feel comfortable with that then they should be able to make the choice .
after bse who can blame anybody for not believing the government ?
dr audrey boucher " at the moment there is n't any choice apart from having to pay extra and having to travel all this way . "
dr audrey boucher , a gp from whitchurch , hampshire , said she could understand why some parents still harboured concerns .
" there 's a constant drip feed of stories in the press and radio and television about mmr and after bse who can blame anybody for not believing the government ?
" but i 'm quite sure that mmr is in the best interests of their child . "
dr pat troop , deputy chief medical officer , said : " obviously when you hear concerns - which we take very seriously - we have gone back and back and back to the research community and all the expert groups to make sure we are offering something that is safe .
" we have had lots and lots of independent inquiries already where everybody 's viewpoint , all the evidence has already been reviewed and i 'm not sure by going over it all again we would come up with anything different . "
liberal democrat health spokesman dr evan harris said : " scientific research can not be a slave to opinion polls .
medical research must proceed on the basis of published , properly scrutinised data .
" all the data so far suggests that the mmr vaccine is the safest option . "
rebellious gp next month the general medical council will hear the case of former gp dr peter mansfield .
dr mansfield , 58 , was reported to the gmc after he gave children single immunisation jabs instead of the combined mmr vaccine .
he believes families should have the right to choose single vaccinations instead of the mmr jab even though it is recommended by the department of health .
up to 400 children have received the single immunisations from dr mansfield at a clinic he runs in worcester in the past year .
he has also given single jabs to a further 300 children at his practice in louth , lincolnshire .
dr mansfield was reported to the gmc by a health authority in worcester , which accused him of putting children at risk .

hynix shares were down by a daily limit of 15 % to 935 won at 0405 gmt after salomon smith barney , which put together a rescue package for the troubled south korean firm just three months ago , sold .
" sell orders coming from hynix 's financial advisers -lrb- salomon -rrb- are dampening sentiment , " said park seok-hyun , analyst at kyobo securities .
salomon engineered the 5 trillion won -lrb- $ 3.93bn ; Â£ 2.69bn -rrb- bail-out of hynix in may but the world 's third largest computer memory chip maker has recently asked lenders for more money .
data from the korea stock exchange showed salomon executed sell orders for more than 31 million shares , though it did not specify if salomon was selling on its own or on behalf of a client .
salomon officials were not available for comment .
heavy losses expected hynix is expected to report heavy operating losses this year as a result of the collapse in memory chip prices .
its main creditor korea exchange bank -lrb- keb -rrb- proposed on tuesday that other creditors should provide financial aid of more than 6.7 trillion won or else the company would be put into liquidation .
hynix on tuesday refused to honour 400bn won -lrb- $ 314.7m -rrb- in matured bonds in a move to pressure the minor creditors to go along with the keb 's plan .
concern over hynix finances was behind the moody 's downgrade of its us subsidiary hynix semiconductor manufacturing american on tuesday .
standard and poor 's last week downgraded the long-term ratings of hynix and its us subsidiary .
hynix was officially spun off from the hyundai group on 1 august .

hynix shares were down by a daily limit of 15 % to 935 won at 0405 gmt after salomon smith barney , which put together a rescue package for the troubled south korean firm just three months ago , sold .
" sell orders coming from hynix 's financial advisers -lrb- salomon -rrb- are dampening sentiment , " said park seok-hyun , analyst at kyobo securities .
salomon engineered the 5 trillion won -lrb- $ 3.93bn ; Â£ 2.69bn -rrb- bail-out of hynix in may but the world 's third largest computer memory chip maker has recently asked lenders for more money .
data from the korea stock exchange showed salomon executed sell orders for more than 31 million shares , though it did not specify if salomon was selling on its own or on behalf of a client .
salomon officials were not available for comment .

hynix on tuesday refused to honour 400bn won -lrb- $ 314.7m -rrb- in matured bonds in a move to pressure the minor creditors to go along with the keb 's plan .
concern over hynix finances was behind the moody 's downgrade of its us subsidiary hynix semiconductor manufacturing american on tuesday .

but the statistics have also indicated that some progress is being made in reducing the numbers of patients waiting over 18 months .
the latest figures reinforce a trend in a rise in the number of patients waiting for treatment which has been on the increase since march this year .
last month there were almost 67,000 patients waiting to go into hospital for treatment , and almost 195,000 people waiting for their first appointment with a hospital consultant a rise of 1,900 .
in the past hospitals have been able to clear the backlog of surgical patients over the summer months .
now however emergency pressures mean that a shortage of surgical beds is a year round problem .
progress but the new figures show that hospitals have reduced the number of people waiting over 18 months , especially for knee and hip operations by 2 % .
the announcement follows a new strategy - launched by welsh health minister jane hutt last month - to tackle the waiting list problem .
the new approach means that resources will be concentrated on key diseases such as cancer and heart disease and will shift the focus from waiting lists to waiting times .
ms hutt said the maximum time patients should wait for routine heart surgery would be reduced to12 months by march 2002 , while waiting times for orthopaedic operations reduced to a maximum of 18 months by july 2002 .
the strategy also included improvements in cancer services ..
by the end of 2001 , patients with four types of cancer , including breast cancer , should be seen by a specialist within 10 days of the hospital receiving an urgent gp referral .
the drive to cut waiting lists for cataract surgery continues - with maximum waiting times to be reduced from the current target of six months to four .
booking systems - with gps arranging consultation times directly with the hospital via computer - will also be introduced from march 2002 .
the new waiting times strategy has called on family doctors to ease hospital burdens by providing more services , such as physiotherapy in the community .
mrs hutt also urged for patients to be discharged more quickly and called on health trusts to set up prioritisation systems in the five health areas with the longest waiting times .
figures released by the welsh assembly in april showed waiting list numbers had fallen by 10,000 since the previous year .
back in may , assembly members voted not to censure health minister jane hutt on the issue of failing to meet targets set to reduce nhs waiting lists .

stunning scenery and a variety of cultural and historical features saw the highlands preferred to devon , greater london and argyll and bute by the eight-person panel .
cartographers and editors at collins ' 2002 road atlas of britain voted for the regions based on information in their new publication .
the panel from england , scotland and wales , was asked to award each region between one and 10 points across a range of categories .
the area is popular for fans of the great outdoors it assessed factors including road provision and quality , flora and fauna and entertainment .
the highlands came ahead of other british regions in four out of the 10 main categories , each judged according to five criteria measuring facilities and features .
it was judged to have the best coastline , best history , best geography and best tourist towns .
the region 's tally of 79 points was 24 points higher than the nearest rival , devon , with 55 points .
natural features london received 48 points , while argyll and bute , with 42 points , scored highly for its natural features , which include loch lomond .
collins cartographic publisher mike cottingham said : " this was a fairly light-hearted exercise which illustrates that while people use road atlases to get from a to b , they can also use them for many other things , such as making informed decisions about different areas of the country .
" the survey also confirmed what we at collins already know - that we are lucky to live in the most interesting and historic country in the world . "
mr cottingham said the highlands had done particularly well because the area had 27 castles , 11 battlefields , 16 ancient monuments , eight museums and 12 distinctive buildings , as well as 19 lighthouses .
the region contains britain 's highest mountains " with more miles of unspoilt coastline than any other area , 32 nature reserves , the most lochs and lakes and the highest and biggest mountains , it 's a must for fans of the great outdoors as well as those fascinated by britain 's historical heritage , " he added .
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy , whose ross , skye and inverness west constituency is in the highlands , said the area exemplified " all that is great about britain " .
he said : " it comes as no surprise to me , a born and bred highlander , that my region has topped the popularity polls as a holiday destination .
" the highlands exemplifies all that is great about britain - with stunning scenery , a beautiful coastline , fascinating history and a genuine sense of community . "

the others are : ratu timoci silatolou - one of mr speight 's most trusted lieutenants illisoni ligiari - a former soldier in britain 's elite special forces , the sas .
all three are being held on the prison island of nukulau , their treason trial is scheduled to start early next year .

in a newspaper article , sir malcolm rifkind insists mr clarke can bring the party together while rival contender iain duncan smith is less electable than outgoing leader william hague .
churchill had it .
thatcher had it .
clarke has it sir malcolm rifkind the comments came as mr clarke attacked a " disgracefully misleading " weekend poll , suggesting huge support for his rival , after it emerged that a duncan smith supporter had helped the survey authors .
while the clarke camp boasted they had the backing of 74 former ministers , mr duncan smith remains the bookmakers ' favourite with exactly a fortnight to go before the victor is announced .
bookmakers william hill now have mr duncan smith as the firm 2/9 favourite , with mr clarke 's odds lagging behind at 11/4 .
' experience and panache ' amid speculation many of the party 's 300,000 members have already cast their votes many pundits also believe mr duncan smith is ahead .
nevertheless , mr clarke 's team say he has attracted the support of the " overwhelming majority " of both margaret thatcher 's and john major 's last cabinets .
sir malcolm rifkind is one of those former ministers and he argues in wednesday 's times that a tory leader needs experience , panache and an " unmistakable rapport with the public " .
he continues : " churchill had it .
thatcher had it .
clarke has it . "
sir malcolm says mr clarke was not a euro-federalist and in fact held views similar to those of party members on many , if not all , european issues .
he claims both candidates have " form " on europe but mr clarke has shown himself willing to compromise .
" i and many others believe that clarke is able to lead a united party , but if we are wrong we will know that in a few months ' time and both he and his colleagues would then have to accept that his leadership could not continue .
" the prospect of beating blair and ousting labour is sufficiently attractive for us to take the risk . "
and , suggesting mr duncan smith would prove even less electable than the man he would replace , sir malcolm goes on : " hague was from the centre right of the party ; duncan smith is seen to the candidate of the hard right . "
' bogus ' poll mr clarke has dismissed as " bogus " an icm poll for last week 's sunday telegraph , which suggested 76 % of party members would vote for his rival .
" conservative members all over the country will have been disgracefully misled by this poll , " mr clarke told wednesday 's guardian .
maureen holding , chairman of the new forest east conservative association , said she had chosen 100 out of her 1,169 association members and given them to icm for the poll .
" i asked the girl in our constituency office to take out the names on our computer , " she said .
" i then selected their names at random and handed them over .
we wanted to select members rather than activists - only four of the names were office holders in the party .
' no campaign connection ' a spokesman for mr duncan smith told bbc news online : " the poll was done by icm and the sunday telegraph .
if there are any concerns they should take it up with them . "
he said the duncan smith campaign had not been involved at all with the poll .
the sunday telegraph says lists for the polls were passed to the paper in " good faith " with the permission of constituency chairmen .
defending the poll , icm stressed that a note accompanying the findings warned : " the data ... is not weighted in any way due to the lack of information on the profile of conservative members . "
both contenders will appear on bbc radio 2 's jimmy young programme on wednesday ahead of another evening hustings meeting before party members in crawley , west sussex .

there is particular concern about those who fail the screening , because they are seen as economic migrants or refugees who can now return home safely .
they can appeal , but if they do not succeed they will be forcibly deported by the pakistani government .
it is not clear how the authorities , who tried and failed to seal the border last year , will prevent them from returning , or what , if any , help will be available inside afghanistan .
the screening process is expected to take three or four months , and refugees at another camp will be screened next year .

bbc news -pipe- reviews -pipe- the strokes : your views categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : entertainment : reviews front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 29 august , 2001 , 09:23 gmt 10:23 uk the strokes : your views do the strokes live up to the hype ?
the strokes are the most talked-about rock band since oasis .
the single modern age was released in the uk in january and the press proclaimed the band the next big thing .
a string of sell-out uk gigs and the follow-up double a-side single new york city cops / hard to explain added more fuel to the hype .
now they are releasing their debut album , is this it .
" like the pistols and oasis before them , they are in the right place at the right time and have a ready-made audience starved of invention , eager to drink in every last fuzzed-up chorus , " says bbc news online 's chris charles .
but what do you think ?
is this the best thing to happen to music in years ?
a refreshing antidote to manufactured pop ?
or is it a lot of fuss about nothing ?
yeah , the strokes are , in my opinion , one of the best things happening in music of late .
the debut album , whilst a tad short , is pacey , full of excellent lyrics and tunes , backed up by the deepest bass undertones .
i hope they stand the test of time .
al whysall , uk more affected arrogance from the most musically challenged generation in ages .
befitting their name , the delivered product is pure brain-death .
the white stripes have proven more worthy of attention - and praise .
robert del valle , usa in the words of peggy lee - is that all there is ?
polly mathers , usa came over to the us for a year 's work experience and got the strokes album in july .
it 's brilliant .
although only 35 minutes long -lrb- off the top of my head -rrb- .
the album of the year dan tebbutt still , just as good as oasis 's definitely maybe .
niraj patel , us umm , who are they exactly ?
joshua dickenson , uk the new york city menswear ... they 'll have come and gone within a year .
k , uk not bad but they do n't deserve all this hype .
the album can not hold a candle to definitely maybe -lrb- oasis 's debut , and had it been released 5 years ago , would anyone have noticed ?
rob , uk the album of the year .
after seeing the strokes at t in the park i was eager to buy the cd - so eager that i could not wait for the uk release .
i ordered it from australia -lrb- where it was released in july -rrb- and received it in four days for only Â£ 10.80 !
right from the first listen , is this it is one of the most impressive and fresh-sounding albums to emerge in the past 12 months .
it 's a welcome break from pre-fab boy / girl band pop pap and could be one of those albums -lrb- like never mind the bollocks , nevermind and definitely maybe -rrb- that inspires kids to pick up guitars and play .
that can only be a good thing .
dan tebbutt , scotland i got it on monday , and it is all i 've been able to listen to .
i 've tried listening to other cds but i can only get about two songs in , because they 're not as good as the strokes .
which is a bit of a compliment , really .
stu , uk another dreary guitar band sadly who lack the melody and cleverness of the smiths orac , uk track 4 is ok , the rest was drab and boring .
heard it all before ... go and buy modest mouse , pavement ...
m , uk i saw them at reading festival .
i was n't impressed - just another band people like to say they discovered first .
pretentious rubbish .
elizabeth , england is this it seems to be a rather impressive reinvention of the wheel .
it 's true there are some great songs on the album - i do n't regret buying it - but worthy of the hype ?
probably not .
niall , uk ok , so the music might not be something we have n't heard before , but thank god a band which looks and acts truly rock 'n'roll has arrived to save us from the mundanity of uncharismatic indie bands .
long live the strokes !
janinja , england lou reed sings with the jam .
good though .
phil , uk it 's good .
but then lots of albums this year have been brilliant .
i recommend it , but i recommend the super furry animals and mercury rev albums more .
damian tichborne , england another dreary guitar band sadly who lack the melody and cleverness of the smiths .
who needs another oasis throwback ?
this is n't the future of music ... thank god .
orac , uk oasis throwback ? !
come on , have you even listened to the album ?
who said they were even trying to put themselves in the same genre as the smiths anyway ?
hype aside , this a cracking debut which should not be brushed aside through stupid comparisons .
chris jones , england this is a very good album that in time will be looked back on as a classic james , uk i 'm from nyc and had never even heard of them until i was in london for my summer holiday .
personally , i like the album , i do n't think they 're the second coming of the beatles though .
and , judging from the fact that they are so much more popular in the uk than even in their hometown , i 'd have to say they have a brilliant publicist ann , usa no album will ever live up this amount of hype .
just look at the stone roses album , the second coming ; everyone was disappointed with it because it had been so hyped .
this is a very good album that in time will be looked back on as a classic , not that many people were that impressed with oasis 's definitely maybe when it was first released .
if you do n't like this then good , there will never be an album that everyone likes .
but if you do like this type of music -lrb- and you are not pretentious and / or elitists -rrb- then you 'll probably like this outstanding debut .
ps look out for the pattern , their debut album is even greater than the strokes .
james , uk after all the press hype , my expectations were shattered hearing them live at reading .
they certainly looked the part of ' the next big thing ' ... pity they sounded more like background music heard in a lift .
robin , uk the best band out right now .
i think i am falling in love matt , australia well , they 're rock 'n'roll all right .
however , all this hype is wasted on me .
they 're really really bad .
saying that , compared to all the other stuff in the charts , they 're ok .
ca n't wait for the next oasis album. some real british rock 'n'roll !
oacs , new zealand thank god bands like the strokes are seeping into the public consciousness .
they genuinely excite me Â¿ their sound and their attitude are something that i Â¿ ve been missing .
i only hope this is the start of a musical resurgence rather than the one off product of an obviously very slick pr-driven machine .
i hope that they Â¿ re not given an easy ride by the public Â¿ it would be devastating if they became the next oasis .
luke , uk rock is dead .
it dried up like the kiss of a long lost lover , a very long time ago .
welcome to packagedsounds ' r ' us plc.com and listen to the strokes .
it will occupy your ears but it wo n't fill your heart .
david w , trinidad after seeing the strokes at the leeds festival , it strikes me that the music press have again picked a dull , uninspired band as the saviours of music .
on the same line-up at the festival , iggy pop and the cult seemed more fresh and relevant .
al h , uk all the tracks sound the same .
dull and boring !
gav h , uk what a shame they 're american !
rodsey , england hey rodsey , with all due respect , there would be no beatles and no pop scene in england if it were 'nt for americans !
think about it , research it .
thanks .
alan , usa seems like the only thing better than being the first to discover a band is being the first to try to bring them down .
bought the album on friday , and had listened to it 10 times by sunday .
this is the second coming folks .
all i can hope for now is that they hang in for the next 15 years .
i have not heard an album so upbeat , with this many hooks since rem 's murmur .
go out and get it , and listen to it two or three times , you will be assimilated .
mark , usa genuine sound and original making of music .
one of the best works i have listened to lately .

the strokes are the most talked-about rock band since oasis .
the single modern age was released in the uk in january and the press proclaimed the band the next big thing .
a string of sell-out uk gigs and the follow-up double a-side single new york city cops / hard to explain added more fuel to the hype .
now they are releasing their debut album , is this it .
" like the pistols and oasis before them , they are in the right place at the right time and have a ready-made audience starved of invention , eager to drink in every last fuzzed-up chorus , " says bbc news online 's chris charles .
but what do you think ?
is this the best thing to happen to music in years ?
a refreshing antidote to manufactured pop ?
or is it a lot of fuss about nothing ?
have your say yeah , the strokes are , in my opinion , one of the best things happening in music of late .
the debut album , whilst a tad short , is pacey , full of excellent lyrics and tunes , backed up by the deepest bass undertones .
i hope they stand the test of time .
al whysall , uk more affected arrogance from the most musically challenged generation in ages .
befitting their name , the delivered product is pure brain-death .
the white stripes have proven more worthy of attention - and praise .
robert del valle , usa in the words of peggy lee - is that all there is ?
polly mathers , usa came over to the us for a year 's work experience and got the strokes album in july .
it 's brilliant .
although only 35 minutes long -lrb- off the top of my head -rrb- .
the album of the year dan tebbutt still , just as good as oasis 's definitely maybe .
niraj patel , us umm , who are they exactly ?
joshua dickenson , uk the new york city menswear ... they 'll have come and gone within a year .
k , uk not bad but they do n't deserve all this hype .
the album can not hold a candle to definitely maybe -lrb- oasis 's debut , and had it been released 5 years ago , would anyone have noticed ?
rob , uk the album of the year .
after seeing the strokes at t in the park i was eager to buy the cd - so eager that i could not wait for the uk release .
i ordered it from australia -lrb- where it was released in july -rrb- and received it in four days for only Â£ 10.80 !
right from the first listen , is this it is one of the most impressive and fresh-sounding albums to emerge in the past 12 months .
it 's a welcome break from pre-fab boy / girl band pop pap and could be one of those albums -lrb- like never mind the bollocks , nevermind and definitely maybe -rrb- that inspires kids to pick up guitars and play .
that can only be a good thing .
dan tebbutt , scotland i got it on monday , and it is all i 've been able to listen to .
i 've tried listening to other cds but i can only get about two songs in , because they 're not as good as the strokes .
which is a bit of a compliment , really .
stu , uk another dreary guitar band sadly who lack the melody and cleverness of the smiths orac , uk track 4 is ok , the rest was drab and boring .
heard it all before ... go and buy modest mouse , pavement ...
m , uk i saw them at reading festival .
i was n't impressed - just another band people like to say they discovered first .
pretentious rubbish .
elizabeth , england is this it seems to be a rather impressive reinvention of the wheel .
it 's true there are some great songs on the album - i do n't regret buying it - but worthy of the hype ?
probably not .
niall , uk ok , so the music might not be something we have n't heard before , but thank god a band which looks and acts truly rock 'n'roll has arrived to save us from the mundanity of uncharismatic indie bands .
long live the strokes !
janinja , england lou reed sings with the jam .
good though .
phil , uk it 's good .
but then lots of albums this year have been brilliant .
i recommend it , but i recommend the super furry animals and mercury rev albums more .
damian tichborne , england another dreary guitar band sadly who lack the melody and cleverness of the smiths .
who needs another oasis throwback ?
this is n't the future of music ... thank god .
orac , uk oasis throwback ? !
come on , have you even listened to the album ?
who said they were even trying to put themselves in the same genre as the smiths anyway ?
hype aside , this a cracking debut which should not be brushed aside through stupid comparisons .
chris jones , england this is a very good album that in time will be looked back on as a classic james , uk i 'm from nyc and had never even heard of them until i was in london for my summer holiday .
personally , i like the album , i do n't think they 're the second coming of the beatles though .
and , judging from the fact that they are so much more popular in the uk than even in their hometown , i 'd have to say they have a brilliant publicist ann , usa no album will ever live up this amount of hype .
just look at the stone roses album , the second coming ; everyone was disappointed with it because it had been so hyped .
this is a very good album that in time will be looked back on as a classic , not that many people were that impressed with oasis 's definitely maybe when it was first released .
if you do n't like this then good , there will never be an album that everyone likes .
but if you do like this type of music -lrb- and you are not pretentious and / or elitists -rrb- then you 'll probably like this outstanding debut .
ps look out for the pattern , their debut album is even greater than the strokes .
james , uk after all the press hype , my expectations were shattered hearing them live at reading .
they certainly looked the part of ' the next big thing ' ... pity they sounded more like background music heard in a lift .
robin , uk the best band out right now .
i think i am falling in love matt , australia well , they 're rock 'n'roll all right .
however , all this hype is wasted on me .
they 're really really bad .
saying that , compared to all the other stuff in the charts , they 're ok .
ca n't wait for the next oasis album. some real british rock 'n'roll !
oacs , new zealand thank god bands like the strokes are seeping into the public consciousness .
they genuinely excite me Â¿ their sound and their attitude are something that i Â¿ ve been missing .
i only hope this is the start of a musical resurgence rather than the one off product of an obviously very slick pr-driven machine .
i hope that they Â¿ re not given an easy ride by the public Â¿ it would be devastating if they became the next oasis .
luke , uk rock is dead .
it dried up like the kiss of a long lost lover , a very long time ago .
welcome to packagedsounds ' r ' us plc.com and listen to the strokes .
it will occupy your ears but it wo n't fill your heart .
david w , trinidad after seeing the strokes at the leeds festival , it strikes me that the music press have again picked a dull , uninspired band as the saviours of music .
on the same line-up at the festival , iggy pop and the cult seemed more fresh and relevant .
al h , uk all the tracks sound the same .
dull and boring !
gav h , uk what a shame they 're american !
rodsey , england hey rodsey , with all due respect , there would be no beatles and no pop scene in england if it were 'nt for americans !
think about it , research it .
thanks .
alan , usa seems like the only thing better than being the first to discover a band is being the first to try to bring them down .
bought the album on friday , and had listened to it 10 times by sunday .
this is the second coming folks .
all i can hope for now is that they hang in for the next 15 years .
i have not heard an album so upbeat , with this many hooks since rem 's murmur .
go out and get it , and listen to it two or three times , you will be assimilated .
mark , usa genuine sound and original making of music .
one of the best works i have listened to lately .

click below to watch the webcast : 56k video 14k audio robin lustig : welcome to talking point .
i am robin lustig in johannesburg with a special edition of the programme and two very special guests .
nelson mandela and his wife , graca machel , have joined us to talk about their work to make the world a better place for children .
next month in new york there will be a special session of the united nations general assembly devoted only to discussion about children .
it will be a rare opportunity for world leaders to pledge their commitment to do more to protect children from war , disease and poverty .
nelson mandela is probably the world 's most respected elder statesman .
his fight for democracy here in south africa won him millions of admirers and after spending more than 26 years in prison he emerged to become the country 's first black president .
since leaving power two years ago he campaigned forcefully on behalf of children , as has graca machel , who has been a highly effective children 's champion for many years and who wrote a highly influential report for the united nations on the impacts of conflict upon children 's lives .
we have had a huge number of e-mails from listeners to the bbc world service and readers of bbc news online , all of whom wanted an opportunity to take part in today 's programme .
at least some of them are going to get a chance now to ask their questions directly to our guests .
welcome to talking point mr mandela ; welcome ms machel .
let 's go straight to our first question .
it comes in fact from england .
tom burke is in plymouth .
hello tom .
tom burke , plymouth , uk : hello .
i would just like to say that are we going to the special session in september and i want to know how your guests think that we can turn what the governments say at the special session into action ?
because far too often , i think , governments say things but do n't turn it into action .
robin lustig : thank you for that tom .
so mr mandela , talk is all very well - what about action ?
nelson mandela : we ... heads of state from various parts of the world will assemble in new york on this occasion offering a unique opportunity to all those who have the commitment about the welfare and the future of our children ...
whilst this meeting we welcome and we believe that a great deal of improvement will occur as far as the welfare of the children are concerned .
but hard work is going to be required because in many of the countries where children face a lot of problems the limitation is that there is no opportunities - even for the leaders in those countries - to fight these challenges that are facing children .
and with no resources and without resources - without a high level of education , without commitment , it is going to be very difficult for many people to do anything .
robin lustig : mrs machel , what reasons do you have to believe that the degree of political commitment to improving children 's lives is greater now than it has been in the past ?
graca machel after the first children 's summit of 1990 i believe that child rights have been quite high on the international agenda .
there is much more awareness today than there has been in the past .
but more importantly , there is some progress which can be measured since 1990 .
it is limited , but there is progress .
we can see what has been happening in education , in malnutitrion .
in some countries it has improved tremendously .
so i feel the momentum is there .
what i believe is extremely important is to strengthen the political will - that people have to mean what they say .
they have to allocate human resources to make things happen , but they also need to allocate financial and material resources .
robin lustig : let 's take another call from egypt this time , talha asmal .
hello talha .
hello , mdeba and graca .
i am a south african .
i am in egypt because my father is a political counsellor in the south african embassy .
my question to you is : what should the world leaders do about the thousands of aids orphans in africa and around the world ?
robin lustig : mr mandela it is a huge problem of course here in south africa - more people living with hiv and aids in this country than in any other country in the world .
what are your feelings about what can and should be done ?
nelson mandela : there are many organisations in this country which are concerned and which have formulated plans in order to deal with aids .
but we are facing tremendous problems - firstly from the point of view of preventive action .
a great deal of propaganda has to be undertaken because the customs and culture in certain communities amongst us prohibits us from talking about sex whatever you are going to say .
so we have to go and break through that barrier .
and then secondly from the point of view of preventive action , many people are shy to declare that they suffer from aids .
in other words , they are signing their own death warrant because if a person hides the fact that he 's ill , there is no way in which he can be cured .
but one of the most important things on which some of us are working on is to ensure that the big companies do not just concentrate on the urban areas - they go out to the rural areas because there the pandemic is creating a great deal of havoc .
recently we saw some of the big companies say we want them to make available their resources - their expertise - so that we can turn the whole question around , emphasising that it is in countries where the leaders are in the forefront - like uganda , like senegal - where leaders are seen fondling children with aids and putting them on their laps and so on .
we have to develop that approach and i think that we are on the way of doing so .
but still the challenge is very big .
robin lustig : we have had a couple of e-mail questions about the role of the big international financial institutions in helping the work for children .
sandy james in london asked : do you really think that the likes of the international monetary fund and the world bank make a difference in the lives of poor children around the world ?
i believe doing more locally , getting the people themselves involved , getting them educated is a far more effective way than sending money via corrupt governments and organisations .
dick carpenter , spokane , usa asks : it seems to me that world organizations have no ability to deal with the collective plight of the world 's children in a similar way that they ca n't deal with dictators who devastate their own people .
meanwhile individual governments do n't seem to have the will to help their own children .
do you agree ?
graca machel well i think we need both .
we need the global institutions really to release the capacity and the resources they have and to make them available to national institutions to operate .
we ca n't say that only national organisations can make a difference .
global institutions like the imf , world bank and others - yes they have more and more to respond to the challenge of being not only heard but seen to be releasing resources to make programmes at national level work .
secondly , i agree that children are not in abstract - they are in a country , they are in a province , they are in a district .
so it is important that national governments , religious groups , civil society organisations , unions - whoever - everybody has to concentrate in making the lives of children better .
because at the end the whole of society is going not only to benefit , but actually it is going to change if we concentrate on children .
robin lustig : where do you focus most of your energy ?
do you focus it on those institutions - on the imf and the world bank - or do you focus it on individual national governments ?
graca machel no , more in national governments actually i have to so .
now and again , yes , we have been interacting with the global institutions .
but again we believe that at the national level there is still a lot of developing this political will we are talking about so that is where we concentrate more .
robin lustig : let 's take another call .
this one comes from mateus webba da silva who is in new york but who is angolan originally .
mateau hello ...
well .
i do n't think we can hear him but i can tell you approximately what he wanted to say which was about children as soldiers .
what do you say to the argument that sometimes children have to take up arms because otherwise their survival would be at stake ?
graca machel it is unfortunate that adults , on many occasions , put children in situations where they have no option for survival other than to pick up arms .
i have to stress here that the responsibility of that is of adults - it is not of children .
but yes of course it is true that sometimes they have to try to do something if they have to survive and then the only chance they have is to pick up arms .
that is why again i call for the responsibility of adults for never taking a child to be in that situation .
it is our responsibility not theirs .

graca machel it is unfortunate that adults , on many occasions , put children in situations where they have no option for survival other than to pick up arms .
i have to stress here that the responsibility of that is of adults - it is not of children .
but yes of course it is true that sometimes they have to try to do something if they have to survive and then the only chance they have is to pick up arms .
that is why again i call for the responsibility of adults for never taking a child to be in that situation .
it is our responsibility not theirs .

the former south african president and his wife , graca machel , want world leaders to take action to improve the lives of children .
mr mandela and ms machel are hoping these leaders will make specific commitments to shield children from war , disease and poverty when they meet for a special summit in september , sponsored by the united nations children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- .
the 83-year-old mr mandela has inspired the world with his struggle for freedom and democracy in south africa .
after more than 26 years in prison , he emerged in 1990 to become south africa 's first black president , replacing the apartheid regime with a multi-racial democracy .
three years later he was awarded the nobel peace prize .
having stepped down from the presidency in 1999 , mr mandela has been a key player in peace negotiations in the democratic republic of congo , burundi and other african countries .
graca machel was part of the liberation movement in mozambique and is perhaps best known today for her study of the impact of war on children .
nelson mandela , one of the world 's most respected and admired statesmen , and his wife graca machel answered your questions in a special edition of our phone-in programme talking point , on wednesday 29 august .
transcript robin lustig : welcome to talking point .
i am robin lustig in johannesburg with a special edition of the programme and two very special guests .
nelson mandela and his wife , graca machel , have joined us to talk about their work to make the world a better place for children .
next month in new york there will be a special session of the united nations general assembly devoted only to discussion about children .
it will be a rare opportunity for world leaders to pledge their commitment to do more to protect children from war , disease and poverty .
nelson mandela is probably the world 's most respected elder statesman .
his fight for democracy here in south africa won him millions of admirers and after spending more than 26 years in prison he emerged to become the country 's first black president .
since leaving power two years ago he campaigned forcefully on behalf of children , as has graca machel , who has been a highly effective children 's champion for many years and who wrote a highly influential report for the united nations on the impacts of conflict upon children 's lives .
we have had a huge number of e-mails from listeners to the bbc world service and readers of bbc news online , all of whom wanted an opportunity to take part in today 's programme .
at least some of them are going to get a chance now to ask their questions directly to our guests .
welcome to talking point mr mandela ; welcome ms machel .
let 's go straight to our first question .
it comes in fact from england .
tom burke is in plymouth .
hello tom .
tom burke , plymouth , uk : hello .
i would just like to say that are we going to the special session in september and i want to know how your guests think that we can turn what the governments say at the special session into action ?
because far too often , i think , governments say things but do n't turn it into action .
robin lustig : thank you for that tom .
so mr mandela , talk is all very well - what about action ?
nelson mandela : we ... heads of state from various parts of the world will assemble in new york on this occasion offering a unique opportunity to all those who have the commitment about the welfare and the future of our children ...
whilst this meeting we welcome and we believe that a great deal of improvement will occur as far as the welfare of the children are concerned .
but hard work is going to be required because in many of the countries where children face a lot of problems the limitation is that there is no opportunities - even for the leaders in those countries - to fight these challenges that are facing children .
and with no resources and without resources - without a high level of education , without commitment , it is going to be very difficult for many people to do anything .
robin lustig : mrs machel , what reasons do you have to believe that the degree of political commitment to improving children 's lives is greater now than it has been in the past ?
graca machel after the first children 's summit of 1990 i believe that child rights have been quite high on the international agenda .
there is much more awareness today than there has been in the past .
but more importantly , there is some progress which can be measured since 1990 .
it is limited , but there is progress .
we can see what has been happening in education , in malnutitrion .
in some countries it has improved tremendously .
so i feel the momentum is there .
what i believe is extremely important is to strengthen the political will - that people have to mean what they say .
they have to allocate human resources to make things happen , but they also need to allocate financial and material resources .
robin lustig : let 's take another call from egypt this time , talha asmal .
hello talha .
hello , mdeba and graca .
i am a south african .
i am in egypt because my father is a political counsellor in the south african embassy .
my question to you is : what should the world leaders do about the thousands of aids orphans in africa and around the world ?
robin lustig : mr mandela it is a huge problem of course here in south africa - more people living with hiv and aids in this country than in any other country in the world .
what are your feelings about what can and should be done ?
nelson mandela : there are many organisations in this country which are concerned and which have formulated plans in order to deal with aids .
but we are facing tremendous problems - firstly from the point of view of preventive action .
a great deal of propaganda has to be undertaken because the customs and culture in certain communities amongst us prohibits us from talking about sex whatever you are going to say .
so we have to go and break through that barrier .
and then secondly from the point of view of preventive action , many people are shy to declare that they suffer from aids .
in other words , they are signing their own death warrant because if a person hides the fact that he 's ill , there is no way in which he can be cured .
but one of the most important things on which some of us are working on is to ensure that the big companies do not just concentrate on the urban areas - they go out to the rural areas because there the pandemic is creating a great deal of havoc .
recently we saw some of the big companies say we want them to make available their resources - their expertise - so that we can turn the whole question around , emphasising that it is in countries where the leaders are in the forefront - like uganda , like senegal - where leaders are seen fondling children with aids and putting them on their laps and so on .
we have to develop that approach and i think that we are on the way of doing so .
but still the challenge is very big .
robin lustig : we have had a couple of e-mail questions about the role of the big international financial institutions in helping the work for children .
sandy james in london asked : do you really think that the likes of the international monetary fund and the world bank make a difference in the lives of poor children around the world ?
i believe doing more locally , getting the people themselves involved , getting them educated is a far more effective way than sending money via corrupt governments and organisations .
dick carpenter , spokane , usa asks : it seems to me that world organizations have no ability to deal with the collective plight of the world 's children in a similar way that they ca n't deal with dictators who devastate their own people .
meanwhile individual governments do n't seem to have the will to help their own children .
do you agree ?
graca machel well i think we need both .
we need the global institutions really to release the capacity and the resources they have and to make them available to national institutions to operate .
we ca n't say that only national organisations can make a difference .
global institutions like the imf , world bank and others - yes they have more and more to respond to the challenge of being not only heard but seen to be releasing resources to make programmes at national level work .
secondly , i agree that children are not in abstract - they are in a country , they are in a province , they are in a district .
so it is important that national governments , religious groups , civil society organisations , unions - whoever - everybody has to concentrate in making the lives of children better .
because at the end the whole of society is going not only to benefit , but actually it is going to change if we concentrate on children .
robin lustig : where do you focus most of your energy ?
do you focus it on those institutions - on the imf and the world bank - or do you focus it on individual national governments ?
graca machel no , more in national governments actually i have to so .
now and again , yes , we have been interacting with the global institutions .
but again we believe that at the national level there is still a lot of developing this political will we are talking about so that is where we concentrate more .
robin lustig : let 's take another call .
this one comes from mateus webba da silva who is in new york but who is angolan originally .
mateau hello ...
well .
i do n't think we can hear him but i can tell you approximately what he wanted to say which was about children as soldiers .
what do you say to the argument that sometimes children have to take up arms because otherwise their survival would be at stake ?
graca machel it is unfortunate that adults , on many occasions , put children in situations where they have no option for survival other than to pick up arms .
i have to stress here that the responsibility of that is of adults - it is not of children .
but yes of course it is true that sometimes they have to try to do something if they have to survive and then the only chance they have is to pick up arms .
that is why again i call for the responsibility of adults for never taking a child to be in that situation .
it is our responsibility not theirs .

so it is important that national governments , religious groups , civil society organisations , unions - whoever - everybody has to concentrate in making the lives of children better .
because at the end the whole of society is going not only to benefit , but actually it is going to change if we concentrate on children .
robin lustig : where do you focus most of your energy ?
do you focus it on those institutions - on the imf and the world bank - or do you focus it on individual national governments ?
graca machel no , more in national governments actually i have to so .
now and again , yes , we have been interacting with the global institutions .
but again we believe that at the national level there is still a lot of developing this political will we are talking about so that is where we concentrate more .
robin lustig : let 's take another call .
this one comes from mateus webba da silva who is in new york but who is angolan originally .
mateau hello ...
well .
i do n't think we can hear him but i can tell you approximately what he wanted to say which was about children as soldiers .
what do you say to the argument that sometimes children have to take up arms because otherwise their survival would be at stake ?
graca machel it is unfortunate that adults , on many occasions , put children in situations where they have no option for survival other than to pick up arms .
i have to stress here that the responsibility of that is of adults - it is not of children .
but yes of course it is true that sometimes they have to try to do something if they have to survive and then the only chance they have is to pick up arms .
that is why again i call for the responsibility of adults for never taking a child to be in that situation .
it is our responsibility not theirs .

but publicity about mmr may have undermined public confidence about vaccination in general .
a few doctors fear an overuse of vaccines , even the majority believe vaccination is the key to keeping former childhood killer diseases at bay .
long forgotten diseases are " waiting in the wings " to re-emerge and infect the world warns one health expert .
dr john clements , of the world health organisation , warns that failing to vaccinate children against a host of diseases will put children in britain and the rest of the world at risk .
he said : " all the childhood diseases are waiting in the wings , just off stage and are waiting to run in again . "
dr clements said that although better health and social conditions had cut the numbers of death from diseases like diphtheria , that it was n't until a vaccination programme was introduced that the disease became virtually unheard of in the uk .
all the childhood diseases are waiting in the wings , just off stage and are waiting to run in again dr john clements protecting children he stressed that not vaccinating children could have a global impact and that in many countries parents would love to have the vaccine to protect their children like the uk .
" vaccinations save millions of lives a year and it is certainly not true that children stopped dying of measles before the vaccine came in the vast majority of countries in the world .
" indeed there are still about a million deaths occurring from measles simply because we can not get the vaccine to them .
" i do n't think if we asked a mother in uganda if she wanted her child immunised against measles she would have a moments hesitation , because she would know there was a good chance it would die otherwise . "
natural immunity but dr jane donegan , a gp and homeopath , said she personally believes strongly against vaccination , believing that children should build up their own immunity to disease .
she questioned the strength of the link between falling incidence of diseases such as measles in the uk , and the introduction of vaccines .
she said a child 's system should not be overloaded by potentially harmful vaccines .
" we have to look at the possibility of whether or not they have a harmful effect on the system . "
" we are told not to give babies younger than six months citrus , nuts , wheat products and unmodified milk .
yet at the age of two months in our current vaccination programme we actually inject babies with vaccines which contain mercury , some of them , formaldehyde and aluminium . "

the sas personnel on the vessel have put it to the captain that the appropriate thing would be for the captain to return to international waters john howard , australian prime minister the tampa had been lying off the remote australian territory of christmas island since monday , with its human cargo of 438 mainly afghan refugees .
many of them are on hunger strike and have threatened to riot or jump overboard if they are not allowed to land in australia .
australian prime minister john howard said the troops had told the tampa to head back to international waters , but he admitted the captain seems disinclined to move , which " creates , of course , a very serious situation " .
the ship 's owners have accused australia of " piracy " , saying it had no right to board the ship because it represents a sovereign territory of norway .
three high-speed australian navy boats intercepted the tampa after it crossed the 12-mile -lrb- 20km -rrb- territorial limit , and about 60 special air services troops are now on board .
unprecedented situation mr howard said that the tampa had entered australian territorial waters despite an earlier undertaking not to do so if medical assistance was given .
the refugees were picked up on sunday " the sas personnel on the vessel have put it to the captain that the appropriate thing would be for the captain to return to international waters , " he said .
mr howard , who described the situation as difficult and unprecedented , said : " nobody is lacking in compassion with genuine refugees . "
the bbc 's michael peschardt in darwin says the australian military has said control of the ship remains with the captain and crew , although there is little doubt the special forces would act should the vessel try to approach land .
according to australian officials , the soldiers are there to help coordinate efforts to bring food and medicine to those on board .
they are also there in case the crew needs protection , officials said .
anger but the australian action has angered the ship 's owners , oslo-based company wallenius wilhelmsen , who warned they would take legal action against canberra if australia forced the ship back into international waters .
australian doctors who have boarded the vessel say only a handful needed medical attention .
there are conflicting reports about the condition of those on board but company regional director peter dexter said the captain , arne rinnan , had ignored orders to move because the health of the asylum seekers was worsening .
" he considers it impractical and unsafe to do so given the responsibility he has for the people on board , " mr dexter was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
the tampa , a container ship , was built to accommodate 40 people .
it now has nearly 500 on board .
christmas island harbour masters don o 'donnell said the tampa was stationary offshore and no one has left since the troops boarded it .
" i am looking at it out my window and it 's about five miles off and holding position .
it is still in australian territorial waters " mr o 'donnell said .
riot threat the tampa picked up the refugees on sunday , as the wooden indonesian vessel carrying them was on the point of sinking .
they have demanded to be taken to australia , but sydney says that they should be returned to indonesia .
after initially refusing to accept them , indonesia said on tuesday that it would allow the ship to land there .
but the refugees threatened to riot if the tampa sailed out of sight of christmas island .
conditions on board are said to be terrible , with outbreaks of dysentery and scabies .
the ship 's captain was reported to have sent a distress signal late on tuesday appealing for medical help after 15 people fell unconscious on its deck .
adamant australia has organised an operation to provide emergency food and medical supplies to the refugees , but it remains adamant in its refusal to allow the ship to dock .
the un 's refugee agency is urging australia , indonesia and norway to cooperate to resolve the asylum seekers ' plight .

protests : ministers have faced rural pressure the foot-and-mouth crisis has focused attention like never before on farming and fears of a genuine and continuing crisis in the countryside .
even before the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease , british farmers had been experiencing one of the worst agricultural slumps on record .
in 2000 , official figures show that income from farming dropped for the fifth successive year .
farm income changes 00-01 -13 % : all types -15 % : dairy + 2 % : hill cattle / sheep -5 % : lowland cattle / sheep -25 % : cereals -21 % : other crops + 204 % : pigs / poultry -2 % : mixed source : maff -lrb- now defra -rrb- at the same time , the farm business survey , produced by the then ministry of agriculture , fisheries and food -lrb- now defra -rrb- put farming incomes at an average of Â£ 5,200 - a 10 % fall on the previous year and a two-thirds fall on five years ago .
the national farmers ' union estimated that some 51,000 farmers and farm workers lost their livelihoods in the two years to june 2000 , something that the organisation 's president ben gill has described as the " biggest exodus in living memory " .
putting aside the foot-and-mouth crisis , the overwhelming cause of the problems faced by agriculture has been the strength of the pound has opened up the uk to cheap food imports .
at the same time , the value of direct support from the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- - approximately 40 % of total farm income - has fallen because of the weakness of the euro , in which the support is calculated .
this was exacerbated by the eu ban on british beef in the wake of bse , a collapse in world commodity prices , higher oil prices and environmental factors such as floods .
long-term health these medium-term developments have affected the long-term viability of agriculture and the countryside , say farmers .
for instance , the labour force has been falling but farm sizes have been increasing .
this is changing not only the demographic shape of the countryside but its character too .
last year , an nfu survey suggested nearly half of hill farmers believed their children would leave agriculture because of low incomes and instability .
this , say farmers , affects the wider rural economy , including the sustainability of village life and the relative power of small producers against the major food groups such as the supermarket chains and processed foods industry .
and as the problems worsen , they predict , more people will leave the land in an ever-decreasing circle .
the post office one of the key concerns for the countryside lobby has been the uncertain future of approximately 10,000 rural post offices .
the government wants all automate the payment of benefits directly into bank accounts rather than over the counter at post offices in order to cut social services costs .
the countryside alliance , the ad hoc lobby group of rural life organisations and pressure groups , warned that this would have a massive impact on rural post offices .
ministers have accepted that the new benefits system would hit rural post offices - but it has sought to carve out a new role for the service through the " universal bank " .
the service , which has been backed by the major high street banks , allows any account holder to pay in or withdraw cash at a post office .
in theory , not only does this provide rural post offices with new business to replace the loss of benefit payments , it also counters the loss of rural bank branches - meaning that money will stay in rural economies .
other plans for the post office include providing internet access points and expanding the " one-stop-shop " idea of providing many government services in one place .
government policy labour has battled hard against critics who claim that it came to power in 1997 without a coherent agricultural and countryside policy .
in march 2000 action plan for farming pledged Â£ 200m to alleviate the crisis in prices .
ministers have also promised to push for further reform of the european union common agricultural policy which , critics say , works against british farmers ' interests by encouraging over-production rather than environmental management .
in november 2000 the government published its rural white paper which proposed measures to improve services , tackle poverty , redevelop the rural economy and protect the countryside and wildlife .
the countryside agency , which advises the government , has called for ministers to speed up the implementation of these measures .

kawasaki and suzuki have seen their market share around the world fall , in part because of increased competition from us giant harley davidson and germany 's bmw .
on top of that , an aging population in japan and around the world has meant that there are fewer young people to buy the bikes that symbolise youth and rebellion .
the deal covers product development , procurement and production .
" we decided to join forces to raise our profitability by reducing costs amid increasing competition in europe , north america and asia , " a kawasaki spokesman said .
crowded market suzuki and kawasaki are the third and fourth largest bike companies in japan .
honda and yamaha are the top two bike companies respectively .
all four companies have seen their share of the european market fall from 80 % to 50 % .
overall japanese bike shipments have dropped from a peak of 3.3 million a year in the early 1980s to 744,000 in the past year .
this can in part be attributed to the aggressive marketing of rivals such as bmw and harley davidson .
motor cycle news editor rob mcdonald said that the " global motorcycle market is healthy " , it is just the japanese share of it that is falling .
" this is all about reducing their cost base , so they can compete globally , " he told the bbc 's world business report .
" they will keep separate identities , motorcycling is a very passionate subject , people are very passionate about the bikes they ride , " he said .
saturation point ?
only last week , the manufacturer of the iconic us motorbike announced plans to build its market share in europe .
after going bankrupt in the 1980s , harley davidson is now prospering .
however it fears it could be approaching saturation in its home market and wants to build exports , which account for only 25 % of its sales .
the japanese companies are also pinning their hopes on markets in countries such as china and india .
many of the 11 million motorbikes sold in china last year were copies of japanese designs .
last year , suzuki saw its sales in china fall by 70 % .
other japanese companies are struggling to keep apace with competition .
yamaha has promised to cut costs by 30 % by the end of the 2004/05 business year to improve its cost efficiency . watch / listen on this story rob mcdonald , editor of industry tabloid motor cycle " for the japanese to do this together is unique in the motor cycle industry " see also : 20 aug 01 -pipe- business harley-davidson rides into europe internet links : suzuki kawasaki the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : worldcom chiefs refuse to testify buoyant ebay snaps up bills firm digital tv woes hit pace profits bush vows action after scandals merck ' exaggerated ' revenue in accounts congress pushes accounting reform oil trade thaws us-russian ties hiv : the drug firms ' quest for a cure links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

the rocket blasted off into a clear blue sky from its launch site on tanegashima island , about 1,000 km -lrb- 625 miles -rrb- south of tokyo , at 1600 local time -lrb- 0700gmt -rrb- .
this was very much a success .
we should get bonus points nasda spokesman yorihiko kikuyama forty minutes later , the craft deployed a test satellite , crowning a mission described by a national space development agency -lrb- nasda -rrb- spokesman as " very much a success " .
the h-2a rocket is intended to establish a japanese presence in the commercial satellite launch market , now dominated by the united states and europe , but it has suffered repeated technical problems .
relieved applause live pictures broadcast on japanese television showed relieved nasda personnel break into restrained applause shortly after the launch .
h-2a facts ht - 53 metres -lrb- 174 feet -rrb- wt - 285 tonnes cost - $ 71m payload - 4 tonnes commentary described the engines and navigational systems as running smoothly as the rocket climbed towards its orbit 270 km -lrb- 167 miles -rrb- above the earth .
about half-way up and beyond the earth 's atmosphere , the heat deflecting fairing protecting the payload compartment separated from the craft , followed shortly after by the first-stage engine .
a nasda official said the payload and second stage engine would remain in orbit for about a year until they burned up on re-entering the atmosphere .
the launch had been delayed several times - a last-minute hitch with loading rocket fuel put back the schedule by several hours on wednesday .
last week , a problem with a valve in one of the rocket 's engines was exacerbated by the arrival of typhoon pabuk , which prevented investigators from flying to the launch site from the mainland .
troubled project nasda was set up in 1969 and launched japan 's first totally self-developed rocket , the h-2 , in 1994 .
the last h-2 was destroyed after launch but the h-2 programme was cancelled in 1999 after the first-stage engine of the rocket cut out too early and the rocket was deliberately destroyed along with its $ 83m -lrb- Â£ 57m -rrb- satellite payload .
six other h-2s were launched and both the second and sixth launch missions had problems inserting their satellite payloads into correct orbits .
experience gained on the h-2 programme has been incorporated into the h-2a , intended as a competitor to europe 's ariane system .
the first h-2a was due to fly in february 2001 , but there were problems with the rocket 's pipes and plating , and the launch was rescheduled for august .
nasda is optimistic about the h-2a 's future , despite the cancellation in 2000 by hughes space and communications international of a $ 710m -lrb- Â£ 489m -rrb- order for 10 h-2as .
the h-2a is designed specifically for commercial launches and costs half as much as its predecessor .
it can put a four-tonne payload into orbit , and nasda hopes that this will be extended to a 7.5 tonne capacity within two years .
the 53-metre high rocket is built using 20 % fewer parts than its predecessor , which makes it cheaper , and less likely to go wrong .

globalisation has not addressed questions of poverty , of disease , of hunger and of ignorance nelson mandela the former south african president was speaking to bbc news online in johannesburg with his wife graca machel during a special edition of talking point , a multimedia phone-in programme produced in association with bbc world service .
poverty and hunger are " a real challenge to everyone in the world , including the so-called advanced industrial nations " , he said .
since he stepped down as south african president , mr mandela has been lobbying governments to do more for their children and will address a special session of the united nations general assembly next month .
" one of the tragedies that we are facing is that of globalisation , which has not addressed questions of poverty , of disease , of hunger and of ignorance , " he said .
" we do expect everyone ... to commit resources and help those countries who have no resources . "
' smart sanctions ' mr mandela also criticised the impact on children of international " comprehensive sanctions " imposed on rogue states , saying that it is the leaders that should be targeted .
answering a question from an afghan child in a refugee camp in pakistan , he said that children should never be hurt by sanctions .
" sanctions should be directed to those people in government who are violating human rights , but things like medical supplies ... and food for children must be available . "
afghanistan is currently the subject of wide-ranging sanctions because of the human rights record of its taleban leaders .
recently , attempts to switch to so-called " smart sanctions " on iraq failed at the united nations security council .
iraq says that thousands of children have died because of un sanctions .
veiled criticism one of the major concerns of mr mandela and his wife graca machel is the fight against aids , which has already left 800,000 orphans in south africa alone .
mr mandela 's successor as president , thabo mbeki , has been widely criticised for not doing more to fight the hiv / aids pandemic .
in what could be seen as a veiled criticism of mr mbeki , mr mandela highlighted the important role played by leaders of african countries such as uganda and senegal , which are managing to reduce the rate of hiv infection .
there is even more respect for those who say , ' i will not desert my country whatever the problems nelson mandela and he praised leaders that cuddled children with aids to highlight the issue " we have to develop that approach , " he said .
although one of the goals of mr mandela 's global movement for children is stopping the use of child soldiers , he claimed that in the fight against apartheid , the african national congress had no choice but to send children abroad for military training .
" the enemy became even more arrogant and tightened the screws of oppression and in that situation , we had no alternative , " he told the bbc .
modern slavery asked about child prostitution , graca machel said it was a form of modern slavery , which the world must unite to stamp out , as when slavery was abolished in the 19th century .
also at a time when unemployed people in poor countries are desperate to emigrate to find work in the west , mr mandela urged them to stay at home .
" although we sympathise with the unemployed who feel they should go abroad and explore new pastures , there is even more respect for those who say : i will not desert my country whatever the problems . "

the nikkei 225 lost 1.87 % to close at 10,979.76 , falling below 11,000 for the first time since 2 october 1984 .
the remarks by financial services minister hakuo yanagisawa overshadowed a government plan to stimulate the stock market by cutting capital gains tax on share trading .
the tax will be slashed by more than half , to 10 % from 26 % , the financial services agency said .
unemployment record the bad news about japan 's banking sector comes a day after data showed unemployment had hit a 5 % record in july , the highest level since records began after world war ii .
the cut in tax on share deals is to encourage small investors to take their savings out of the bank and invest in the market to stimulate the economy .
without a decisive policy action by the government , 11,000 will be just a passing point yoshihisa okamoto , fuji investment the government of prime minister junichiro koizumi is desperate to get japanese consumers investing and spending but they resolutely refuse to do so as job insecurity grows .
japan 's banks are burdened with bad debt as a result of previous attempts to stimulate the economy by lending to employment-creating construction projects which have covered japan with under-used bridges , ports and airports .
' backed away ' on wednesday , the financial services minister said it will take seven years to cut japanese banks ' bad debts in half .
mr yanagisawa said non-performing loans will be reduced to between seven and 10 trillon yen -lrb- $ 58bn-83bn -rrb- over seven years , from 17.4 trillion yen now .
this is a slower timetable than set out previously , when the government hoped for substantial reductions by 2003 .
" the fsa has effectively backed away from the intent of the countermeasures it set out in april , " said darrel whitten of abn amro .
" also the accelerated planned write offs - the first priority of the koizumi agenda - has been watered down . "
" the build up of bad debt is occuring faster than they can write off existing bad debt , " kenneth courtis , deputy chairman of goldman sachs asia in tokyo , told the bbc 's world business report " there is some sense that reform has started , but it is so partial and incomplete and unclear that investors are just standing back on the sidelines , " he added .
more falls expected analysts do not think the nikkei 's plunge through the 11,000 barrier will be the end of its downward slide .
" without a decisive policy action by the government , 11,000 will be just a passing point , " said yoshihisa okamoto of fuji investment management .
the cabinet is showing increasing signs of division over how far and how fast to pursue restructuring through economic austerity and tight discipline on public spending .
trade minister takeo hiranuma , a member of the liberal democrat party 's old guard , called for a supplementary budget of 5 trillion yen in response to the record jobless figures .
borrowing cap later in the day , a government official indicated mr koizumi might bring forward a cap on new goverment borrowing in the bond market , set to start in april 2002 , into the current financial year .
as the nikkei fell on wednesday , mr koizumi received support from bank of japan governor masaru hayami .
mr hayami told a business conference in osaka that it was " vital that structural reforms make progress " if stimulus measures taken by the bank were to be effective .
the nikkei 's slide prompted cabinet secretary yasuo fukada to say the japanese government was monitoring the stock market carefully .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- japanese stocks plunge to new low categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 29 august , 2001 , 10:54 gmt 11:54 uk japanese stocks plunge to new low the government is urging people to spend money japan 's main stock market index has plunged to its lowest closing level for 17 years after the country 's financial regulator said it might take twice as long as the government expects to reduce bad debts in the banking sector .
the nikkei 225 lost 1.87 % to close at 10,979.76 , falling below 11,000 for the first time since 2 october 1984 .
the remarks by financial services minister hakuo yanagisawa overshadowed a government plan to stimulate the stock market by cutting capital gains tax on share trading .
the tax will be slashed by more than half , to 10 % from 26 % , the financial services agency said .
unemployment record the bad news about japan 's banking sector comes a day after data showed unemployment had hit a 5 % record in july , the highest level since records began after world war ii .
the cut in tax on share deals is to encourage small investors to take their savings out of the bank and invest in the market to stimulate the economy .
without a decisive policy action by the government , 11,000 will be just a passing point yoshihisa okamoto , fuji investment the government of prime minister junichiro koizumi is desperate to get japanese consumers investing and spending but they resolutely refuse to do so as job insecurity grows .
japan 's banks are burdened with bad debt as a result of previous attempts to stimulate the economy by lending to employment-creating construction projects which have covered japan with under-used bridges , ports and airports .
' backed away ' on wednesday , the financial services minister said it will take seven years to cut japanese banks ' bad debts in half .
mr yanagisawa said non-performing loans will be reduced to between seven and 10 trillon yen -lrb- $ 58bn-83bn -rrb- over seven years , from 17.4 trillion yen now .
this is a slower timetable than set out previously , when the government hoped for substantial reductions by 2003 .
" the fsa has effectively backed away from the intent of the countermeasures it set out in april , " said darrel whitten of abn amro .
" also the accelerated planned write offs - the first priority of the koizumi agenda - has been watered down . "
" the build up of bad debt is occuring faster than they can write off existing bad debt , " kenneth courtis , deputy chairman of goldman sachs asia in tokyo , told the bbc 's world business report " there is some sense that reform has started , but it is so partial and incomplete and unclear that investors are just standing back on the sidelines , " he added .
more falls expected analysts do not think the nikkei 's plunge through the 11,000 barrier will be the end of its downward slide .
" without a decisive policy action by the government , 11,000 will be just a passing point , " said yoshihisa okamoto of fuji investment management .
the cabinet is showing increasing signs of division over how far and how fast to pursue restructuring through economic austerity and tight discipline on public spending .
trade minister takeo hiranuma , a member of the liberal democrat party 's old guard , called for a supplementary budget of 5 trillion yen in response to the record jobless figures .
borrowing cap later in the day , a government official indicated mr koizumi might bring forward a cap on new goverment borrowing in the bond market , set to start in april 2002 , into the current financial year .
as the nikkei fell on wednesday , mr koizumi received support from bank of japan governor masaru hayami .
mr hayami told a business conference in osaka that it was " vital that structural reforms make progress " if stimulus measures taken by the bank were to be effective .
the nikkei 's slide prompted cabinet secretary yasuo fukada to say the japanese government was monitoring the stock market carefully . watch / listen on this story kenneth courtis , goldman sachs asia " we are dealing with a financial tragedy " see also : 28 aug 01 -pipe- business japan 's jobless at record 27 aug 01 -pipe- business japan ' aid ' for unemployed ? 31 jul 01 -pipe- business japan 's jobless at record high 29 jul 01 -pipe- business can koizumi save japan ? 20 aug 01 -pipe- business bank of japan targets deflation internet links : ministry of finance bank of japan tokyo stock exchange the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : worldcom chiefs refuse to testify buoyant ebay snaps up bills firm digital tv woes hit pace profits bush vows action after scandals merck ' exaggerated ' revenue in accounts congress pushes accounting reform oil trade thaws us-russian ties hiv : the drug firms ' quest for a cure links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

father rufus halley : originally from ireland father rufus halley , 57 , was attacked by masked men as he rode home on his motorcycle to the town of malabang on the southern island of mindanao .
the police said the kidnappers may have links with the muslim separatist group , the moro islamic liberation front -lrb- milf -rrb- .
the group signed a ceasefire with the philippines government early this month and is engaged in peace talks .
peacemaker police have mounted a manhunt for the suspected kidnappers , said regional police chief senior superintendent akmad omar .
one of the men being hunted is sumagayan daing , a son of a former commander of the milf rebels .
he loved the work , he loved bringing muslims and christians together father mulkerins eduardo ermita , president gloria arroyo 's adviser on the peace process , said the police suspected the kidnappers were rebel members of the milf , rather than regular members .
the priest , from the irish county of waterford , had lived in the philippines for 20 years , and worked to promote unity between christians and muslims in an area torn by separatist conflict .
he had just come from a meeting between the two communities when he was attacked .
' brave ' man he was a vocal advocate of peace talks with the milf and last year publicly criticised then-president joseph estrada for calling off peace talks and launching a massive military offensive against the group .
the previous government called off peace talks father mulkerins , a friend of the dead priest since their seminary days in dublin , said his friend knew of the dangers of his work .
" like the others , he loved the work , he loved bringing muslims and christians together ...
he was very conscious of the risks but he was brave and tried to live in a way that would not antagonise anybody . "
mr estrada was forced from office in january , and his successor , president arroyo , restarted talks with the milf two months later .
foreign and filipino missionaries have often been targeted by gunmen in mindanao and nearby islands .
the motive has mainly been kidnap for ransom .

the countryside agency is publishing a report on wednesday showing how the disease has had a profound impact on rural britain far beyond the farming industry and the areas immediately affected by the outbreak .
the overall cost to the economy this year is expected to be up to Â£ 4bn , with losses to the tourism industry accounting for the lion 's share .

a wide range of rural businesses from agricultural suppliers to pubs , garages and local shops have all suffered severe losses of income .
the agency 's chairman , ewen cameron , who also acts as the government 's rural advocate , says there will be more bankruptcies and fewer jobs as a result of the crisis , and that rural communities will suffer for years to come .
" in the areas hardest hit , such as cumbria , devon , parts of herefordshire , north yorkshire and the north east , it 's a double blow .
" agriculture was already in recession and many households depended on rural tourism and its suppliers for jobs and income , " mr cameron said .
the report found the disease could add to many of the pressures already facing rural communities , speeding up the loss of local services and forcing many young people to move away from their villages to urban areas because of a lack of local jobs .

the report acknowledges that it will be some time before the full impact of foot-and-mouth can be assessed - but it is clear that it has made the survival of many rural communities even more fragile .
