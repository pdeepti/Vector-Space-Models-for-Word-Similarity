greenpeace and friends of the earth are asking consumers to stop buying petrol and other products from exxon mobil , which in britain trades under the name esso , until the company changes its stance on climate change .
the boycott is backed by controversial artist damien hurst , comic rory bremner , singer annie lennox , actress bianca jagger the former wife of rolling stones singer mick , and anita roddick founder of the body shop , which plans to publicise the campaign in its uk stores .
exxon mobil confirmed its bogeyman status among environmental campaigners by taking out a series of full-page advertisements in american newspapers , opposing us participation in the kyoto protocol on climate change .
the call for a boycott of esso service stations can only be counter-productive esso campaigners say that lobbying by exxon played a major part in president bush 's subsequent decision not to ratify the protocol despite the fact that america accounts for a quarter of all " greenhouse " gas emissions .
the protocol would have obliged the us to cut emissions of the gases , which some scientists believe to be the cause of global warming , by 5 % from 1990 levels .
renewable energy ms jagger said that esso had " never invested a single penny in renewable energy " .
but the company said in a statement that it had previously invested £ 350m in a range of ventures , including solar power .
" we believe that the type of actions we are taking in our business now , including the development of cleaner fuel technology , leading edge fuel cell research and substantial energy efficiency projects , will make a significant contribution to long-term global emissions reduction , " esso added .
" the call for a boycott of esso service stations can only be counter-productive in that we do not believe it will have any influence on the us government - but it could harm the thousands of independent british businessmen and women and their staff who operate their stations in partnership with esso in the uk .

the news came as the company said it expected to meet projections for first-quarter profit of 17 cents a share and revenue of $ 8bn .
but over the next two quarters the round rock , texas-based company intends to layoff as much as 10 % of its workforce - 3,000-4,000 workers .
the company said most of the job cuts would come in texas .
in part , they would be achieved through attrition .
these latest cuts come in addition to the 1,700 job losses dell announced in february .
' streamlining ' dell 's cuts come in the face of much weaker demand in the us for personal computers and technology services .
like many other companies , dell has reacted by cutting costs .
it has also made an aggressive move for greater market share , reducing the prices of its products . .
" slowing industry growth is both requiring dell to resize its workforce and allowing the company to streamline its organisation after several years of rapid expansion , " the company said in a statement .
gerard klauer mattison & co analyst david bailey said : " their reiteration of their revenue and earnings guidance is positive , but the fact they are cutting additional jobs seems to signify that they are expecting demand to remain weak and for the price war to continue . "
the news came after trading ended on the new york markets .
dell shares , which are listed on the technology-dominated nasdaq market , gained slightly in monday trading to end the day at $ 25.91 .
dell is due to report first-quarter results on 17 may .
in the first quarter of 2000 , dell made $ 525m - or 19 cents a share - profit on sales of $ 7.28bn.

the report , due to be discussed on tuesday , will cover the management of the european unit of the welsh exams board , the welsh joint education committee .
it is expected to include references to his business dealings and the use of a corporate credit card .
the wjec could have to pay back £ 400,000 in grants the report is not specifically about former teacher mr german , but inevitably most attention will focus on what it says about his activities as head of the wjec 's european unit .
the committee called in external auditors when it emerged that it might have to pay a sizeable sum back to the eu as a result of the unit 's operations .
a report by accountants pricewaterhouse coopers suggested last year the wjec could have to give back more than £ 400,000 in european grants .
mr german has insisted that the unit was in the black when he left and he has denied being responsible for financial management in his post , which he left at the end of 1998 .
nothing to hide the report due to be considered by the wjec 's board on tuesday afternoon is expected to include his answers to 130 questions about his role - as well as his personal business dealings , his use of a corporate credit card , and the justification for overseas trips .
liberal democrat assembly member mr german has always insisted he has done nothing wrong and has nothing to hide .
nevertheless , the political sensitivity of such an inquiry involving the linchpin of the assembly coalition can hardly be overstated .

the case was brought by hungarian jews living in america who say the property was worth some $ 200m at the time it was stolen .
the united states made no effort to return the assets and did not truthfully respond to requests ... for information about the property lawyer for hungarian jews the property , including gold , artworks , jewellery and oriental rugs , was taken by us troops from what has become known as the gold train shortly after the end of world war ii .
a 1999 report by the us presidential advisory commission on holocaust assets said the army let the train leave hungary and that us personnel then took property from it .
incorrectly classified " the united states made no effort to return the assets and did not truthfully respond to requests from hungarian jewish community organizations for information about the property , " sam dubbin , a lawyer for the plaintiffs , said .
the gold train was captured by american troops in may , 1945 in werfen , austria , 100 kilometres south of salzburg .
the class action lawsuit claims that the us army incorrectly classified the goods on the train as unidentifiable enemy property which meant that the army did not fulfil its obligation to return it to its rightful owners .
cultural loss the property was dispersed after being taken by the army , including 1,100 works of art which were handed over to austria and never officially accounted for and a suitcase of gold dust which disappeared .
it addition , some items were stolen from american army warehouses and others were taken by military officials .
lawyers for the claimants claim the property would now be worth ten times its original estimated worth of $ 200m .
" the monetary restitution is really secondary to the acknowledgment of the loss of the cultural heritage that the people suffered by not having their property returned to them after the war , " mr dubbin said .
while the presidential advisory commission accepted that the us was responsible for the goods on the gold train , it did not suggest how property could be returned or compensation made .
it is estimated that there were some 800,000 jews living in hungary before world war ii but only a quarter of them survived the holocaust .
of those survivors many fled to america , concentrating in florida .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- biggs spends first night behind bars low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo ronnie biggs ' friend , kevin crace " the stories we are hearing at the moment are ridiculous " real 28k biggs ' solicitor jane wearing says he will seek a hearing in the court of appeal real 56k tuesday , 8 may , 2001 , 07:49 gmt 08:49 uk biggs spends first night behind bars biggs : back on british soil after 35 years the train robber ronnie biggs has spent his first night in prison since escaping from jail 35 years ago .
after being flown back to britain from brazil on a chartered plane , biggs was taken to the top security belmarsh prison in south london on monday .
lawyers for the 71-year-old great train robber say he intends to ask the court of appeal to review the outstanding years of his 30-year sentence .
biggs ' solicitor jane wearing said he was seeking a fair and balanced hearing at which all relevant issues can be addressed .
it would n't surprise me if he were not in prison for a decade if he survives that long richard garside nacro " he is confident he will receive such a hearing , " she said .
but a family friend has told the bbc biggs was struggling to find the six-figure sum needed to fund his legal defence .
lawyers are expected to argue that biggs ' health has deteriorated significantly - three strokes have left him partially paralysed and virtually unable to speak .
but the chairman of the law society 's criminal law committee , malcolm fowler , believes that may not be enough to secure biggs ' release .
" there 'll need to be compelling evidence in a case like this as to the nearness of death , the life threatening nature of the illness and so forth , " he said .
richard garside , of nacro - an organisation that works with offenders and former offenders - believes biggs may have to wait a long time for his release .
ronnie biggs appeared frail on his way to court " it seems unlikely that he is going to be released in a hurry and it would n't surprise me if he were not in prison for a decade if he survives that long , " he said .
the home secretary can decide in special circumstances to release a prisoner early .
biggs was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his part in the 1963 robbery , which saw £ 2.6m stolen from a london-to-glasgow mail train .
code breakers meanwhile the press complaints commission is to investigate whether the sun newspaper broke the industry 's code of practice by paying for the criminal 's return .
the paper is reported to have paid £ 44,000 to the friends and family of biggs as part of the deal to fly him to britain .
but family friend kevin crace said some of the stories emerging over the biggs affair were ridiculous .

" at no point , at this present time , will the family walk away with a fortune of money . "
he said the family were looking at a six-figure sum to fund biggs ' legal defence .
the sun claims there was a massive public interest in returning a criminal to face justice .
but ian hargreaves , professor of journalism at cardiff university , said the sun 's breach of the newspaper code of practice was " absolutely self evident and exceptionally brazen " .
" it demands to be dealt with promptly and firmly by the press complaints commission , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" the fact that the sun paid for an aeroplane alone would justify an inquiry .
there are no public interest defence grounds here at all . "

the moroccan prison observatory , an umbrella organisation which incorporates a number of local human-rights groups , speaks of a prison regime that is immersed in corruption , violence , disease and the sexual abuse of children as young as 12 .
they say the country 's prisons house anything up to 80,000 detainees in a system designed for less than half that number .
what makes the overcrowding worse is that , while some prisons are half-empty , in others the only place left to sleep for some prisoners are the toilets .
hygiene is minimal , medical care normally non-existent and disease rife .
child abuse one of the most alarming aspects of the report deals with evidence that children as young as 12 are being kept in the prisons and are regularly falling victim to sexual abuse including rape , even though legally nobody under 16 years old is allowed to be in prison .
mohammed vi has promised reform this is said to be just one aspect of a comprehensive climate of corruption in which , for instance , the only food available to prisoners is that which is brought in by family members who must first pay a bribe to prison warders .
the observatory report is a damning indictment of the country 's prison system at a time when the talk is of general reform and judicial improvement under the new king , mohammed vi .
the fact that the details have been published in the mouthpiece of the senior political party in the coalition government will make it hard for officials to ignore .

it says conservation strategies are failing , with nearly half the world 's major nature reserves being heavily used for agriculture .
yet hunger and malnutrition are widespread in many biodiversity-rich areas .
the authors urge a new approach that will both feed hungry people and also protect wildlife .
the report , common ground , common future : how ecoagriculture can help feed the world and save wild biodiversity , is published by the swiss-based iucn -lrb- the world conservation union -rrb- and future harvest , a washington dc agricultural research group .
forest clearing if forest clearing continues at present rates , it says , the world 's forests could lose more than half their remaining species by 2050 .
it says nearly 24 % of mammal species , more than 12 % of birds and almost 14 % of plants are threatened with extinction today .
yet the strategy of setting aside protected areas for wildlife is not working , the report says .
a total of 45 % of the world 's major nature reserves are heavily used for agriculture , or surrounded by intensively farmed land .
people in areas where wildlife is most at risk often suffer malnutrition and hunger and people living in at least 16 of the world 's 25 key biodiversity hotspots , where wildlife is most at risk , suffer extreme malnutrition and hunger , placing even greater stress on conservation efforts .
the authors say that if only the existing protected areas continue as wildlife habitat , they will lose from 30 % to 50 % of their species , because they do not contain large enough populations to maintain the species .
' dying biodiversity ' the chief scientist of iucn , dr jeffrey mcneely , says : " protected areas are fast becoming islands of dying biodiversity because of the agricultural areas that surround them .
" many animals need the ability to migrate in order to avoid extinction .
" limited reserve areas can not fill this need , and the lands that would be needed for the massive expansion of protected areas are already being used to feed local people and fuel local economies . "
the remedy proposed by the report is ecoagriculture - helping farmers to grow more food while conserving habitats critical for wildlife .
the authors include several dozen case studies of what they say are successful ecoagriculture systems being used in australia , the uk and other european countries , the us , canada , asia , africa and latin america .
common ground the strategies include : establishing networks of wildlife habitat in non-farmed areas and linking these with larger protected areas ; integrating perennial plants into farming systems to mimic natural habitats ; using less polluting farming methods ; increasing productivity on land already being farmed to reduce the need for more land ; making cropland more attractive to wildlife ; and establishing protected areas near farmed land .
dr mcneely says the strategies are based on evidence that humans and wild species can share common ground .
" many people believe that biodiversity can be preserved simply by fencing it off , " he says .
" our report shows that agriculture and biodiversity are inextricably linked .
" to avert widespread extinctions and feed the world , we must integrate biodiversity preservation into all landscapes . "
new mindset his co-author , professor sara scherr , of the university of maryland , says : " many of the new approaches in ecoagriculture will require a change in mindset for many farmers .
" for centuries , farmers have generally done their best to clear land of natural vegetation and keep wildlife off their farms .
" this was the sign of a good farmer .
now we 're asking farmers to let some of the wild back in . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- oil firms : excessive profits ?

shell claims its uk petrol stations have not made a profit for three years at the beginning of 2001 , the oil giants enjoyed a profits boom , prompting anger from motorists and accusations of profiteering .
bbc news online asks whether the outrage is justifiable ?
in the first three months of the year , bp enjoyed profits of £ 2.86bn , exxon mobil reaped £ 3.49bn , while shell netted £ 2.69bn.
and although there may be celebrations behind closed doors , the media 's high profile coverage of the profits has caused the oil firms to feel distinctly uncomfortable .
they have previously faced the wrath of protesters complaining of high fuel prices at the pump in scores of countries .
then the government accused the firms of colluding with the protesters to blame fiscal policy for the high pump prices .
now , in the aftermath of the fuel protests , the oil companies stand accused of profiteering .
it is a charge to which they are acutely sensitive .
low public profile shell , which soon after the fuel crisis in the uk announced record third-quarter profits up 80 % at $ 3.2bn -lrb- £ 2.2bn -rrb- , declined to offer any senior officials for interview by news organisations at the time .
oil firms : the sun may set on high oil prices this year a spokesman said the company only did so when half-year or full-year results were presented .
then , when the company published its full-year result , it blamed the oil producing exporting countries .
" oil prices climbed steadily during much of the year due to production restraints by the major oil exporting countries , " said shell .
the appearance to outsiders is one of coyness at reporting such a strong performance at a time of such high political tension and widespread consumer anger at high fuel prices .
whatever the reason , shell is far from the only oil company to have kept a low public profile since september 's fuel price protests .
but at the same time , usually via their websites , most have conducted detailed and vigorous defences of their positions .
little profit in petrol one of the oil companies ' main points is that despite high pump prices and strong overall profits , they make very little profit selling petrol in the uk .
according to esso - the uk brand of exxon mobil - a retailer makes only about 5p for each litre of unleaded petrol sold for , say , 84p , with the remainder accounted for by duty , vat and the cost of production .
some 61p of each 84p litre sold goes straight to the government in taxes .
the retailer 's 5p has to cover the cost of transporting the product from refinery to distribution terminal , storage and processing and onward transportation to the retail outlets .
after that , the retailer has costs including credit card charges , which alone work out at more than 1p a litre , according to esso .
intense competition among retailers in the uk over several years has additionally squeezed profit margins so tightly that now they barely exist .
shell says it has not made a profit selling petrol in the uk for the past three years .
unpredictable earnings most of the oil companies ' profit derives from crude oil exploration and production .
but the level of their earnings is highly unpredictable , determined by the volatile movements of a single commodity on world markets .
in 2000 , with crude prices at record levels , profits were huge , with for example shell reporting bumper profits of $ 9bn , a massive 85 % rise on the previous year .
exxon and mobil led the rush to merge but in 1998 , when crude slumped to less than $ 10 a barrel , shell 's profits slid by 36 % and exxon 's by 25 % .
in their results statements for 2000 , when crude oil prices peaked at almost $ 36 a barrel , most oil firms were keen to stress they expected average crude prices to fall in 2001 .
prices have indeed fallen , though only down to around the $ 30 mark .
no control of prices an additional factor to bear in mind is that the oil companies have little influence on oil prices or markets .
companies such as exxon mobil , shell , bp , chevron , texaco and totalfinaelf together account for less than 15 % of world crude oil production .
the organisation of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- - effectively made up of state-owned outfits such as saudi aramco and national iranian oil company - is a far bigger player , with about 40 % of world output .
but even opec has had only limited success in forcing prices up or down .
this is because , aside from supply and demand , crude oil prices are determined by unpredictable factors such as the weather , major political events and market sentiment .
against long-term interest as part of their defence of high profits , the oil firms are also arguing that high crude oil prices , although good for profits in the short term , may not be in their long term interests .
shell profits were helped by selling chemicals units shell accepts high crude prices cause anger and hardship among motorists and suggests it would be bad for the company 's image when this situation is sustained .
in addition , high prices encourage development of alternative energy resources , which , in time , might damage the oil producers ' position as the world 's dominant energy suppliers .
no subsidising pump prices some campaigners have said the oil firms should use some of their profits from better performing businesses - in this case exploration and production - to subsidise pump prices .
the oil giants claim this would not be allowed under competition laws because smaller , independent petrol retailers would be put out of business .
with tax forming such a high proportion of the pump price , there would also be no guarantee that governments - committed to reducing fuel consumption - would not just increase taxes to take up the slack .
justifying earnings oil companies also claim , with some justification , that greater oil and gas revenue is not the only factor behind the record earnings .
very low oil prices in 1998 prompted a wave of consolidation and restructuring in the sector as corporations sought to cut costs in the face of tumbling revenue .
about 10 of the world 's biggest oil companies have now merged or are merging into five .
for several , the financial benefits of getting bigger are becoming apparent .
for example exxon mobil , the world 's biggest oil company created through a massive merger in 2000 , announced full-year profits totalling $ 17bn , hitting a world record .
rationalisation shell - the only oil giant to have resisted a merger or acquisition - implemented deep cost cuts of its own and a rationalisation programme that saw much of its chemicals business sold or restructured .
given the present political situation , it seems mildly ironic that strategies firms put in place to help them get out of one tight spot - low prices - have helped land them in another - that of justifying their now very strong performances .
but in the medium term , says shell , returns on oil and gas investments are no better than " average " when compared with many other major industries .
it points to a recent financial times survey of the top 10 best performing industries in europe in the past five years in which oil and gas was ranked 10th behind industries such as life assurance , media , banking and pharmaceuticals .

tuesday 's newspapers are speculating that the conflict with the palestinians could escalate , with israeli airliners being brought down in the future by anti-aircraft missiles .
this military imbalance is deeply upsetting for many in the arab world the israeli press is calling it ' the tip of the iceberg ' .
it believes the arms haul that was displayed on monday night with such fanfare by the israeli navy , may be only a small part of a long-term consignment to radical palestinians .
according to an analysis in the israeli paper , yedioth ahronoth , similar arms shipments have already been unloaded onto beaches in gaza and are now hidden away in warehouses .
the paper offers no proof to back up that assertion , but it speculates that the sort of weapons intercepted at the weekend could bring the israeli-palestinian conflict to all-out war .
israel 's fears the 50 katyusha rockets seized are similar to the weapons that the lebanese guerrilla group , hezbollah , used to fire across the border at northern israel .
israelis now fear that if these are falling into palestinian hands then towns in central and southern israel could be at risk .
also included in the arms haul are a number of strella anti-aircraft missiles .
when used by a skilled operator , these can bring down military helicopters , or more worryingly for the israeli public , even a civilian airliner taking off from tel aviv .
the palestinian authority has denied any connection with the arms shipment , and israeli suspicions are now focusing on dissident palestinian groups such as the popular front for the liberation of palestine .
the israeli press says it does not matter exactly who the arms were destined for .
the fact that someone is trying to ship arms of this nature to the palestinian territories is cause alone for major concern .
under the terms of the oslo peace accords the palestinian security forces are armed only with small arms - kalashnikov assault rifles and m16s .
on the few occasions when these weapons have been used by the palestinian authority 's security forces against israeli troops , the palestinians have been no match for the massive firepower of the israeli army , which is equipped with tanks and helicopter gunships .

tuesday 's newspapers are speculating that the conflict with the palestinians could escalate , with israeli airliners being brought down in the future by anti-aircraft missiles .
this military imbalance is deeply upsetting for many in the arab world the israeli press is calling it ' the tip of the iceberg ' .
it believes the arms haul that was displayed on monday night with such fanfare by the israeli navy , may be only a small part of a long-term consignment to radical palestinians .
according to an analysis in the israeli paper , yedioth ahronoth , similar arms shipments have already been unloaded onto beaches in gaza and are now hidden away in warehouses .
the paper offers no proof to back up that assertion , but it speculates that the sort of weapons intercepted at the weekend could bring the israeli-palestinian conflict to all-out war .
israel 's fears the 50 katyusha rockets seized are similar to the weapons that the lebanese guerrilla group , hezbollah , used to fire across the border at northern israel .
israelis now fear that if these are falling into palestinian hands then towns in central and southern israel could be at risk .
one israeli newspaper speculates that this was not the first arms shipment also included in the arms haul are a number of strella anti-aircraft missiles .
when used by a skilled operator , these can bring down military helicopters , or more worryingly for the israeli public , even a civilian airliner taking off from tel aviv .
the palestinian authority has denied any connection with the arms shipment , and israeli suspicions are now focusing on dissident palestinian groups such as the popular front for the liberation of palestine .
the israeli press says it does not matter exactly who the arms were destined for .
the fact that someone is trying to ship arms of this nature to the palestinian territories is cause alone for major concern .
under the terms of the oslo peace accords the palestinian security forces are armed only with small arms - kalashnikov assault rifles and m16s .
on the few occasions when these weapons have been used by the palestinian authority 's security forces against israeli troops , the palestinians have been no match for the massive firepower of the israeli army , which is equipped with tanks and helicopter gunships .
this military imbalance is deeply upsetting for many in the arab world .
but so far , moderate arab leaders like egypt 's president hosni mubarak have ruled out sending weapons or fighters to join the palestinians .

bbc news -pipe- showbiz -pipe- the pied piper of swindon low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : entertainment : showbiz front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo tuesday , 8 may , 2001 , 09:40 gmt 10:40 uk the pied piper of swindon billie piper burst onto the scene in 1997 from 15-year-old pop star to 18-year-old bride , bbc news online looks at the life and career of billie piper .
most teenage years are eventful but few could compare with the last three years in the life of billie piper .
the singer has enjoyed pop success with number one singles , a romance with 5ive singer ritchie , a painful break-up with the boy band member , a harrowing court case involving a stalker and a celebrity marriage to chris evans .
she has had enough angst , heartache and joy to fill the pages of more than a few teenage diaries .
billie : from pop star to bride in three years piper 's rise to fame began in 1997 , when she was just 15 .
like many schoolgirls , she spent her evenings reading pop bible smash hits , dreaming of what might happen .
in her case , it did .
the swindon teenager entered a smash hits modelling competition , and ended up fronting a tv campaign for the magazine .
pop executives soon spotted this bright new talent .
using the same record label , producers and pr company who propelled the spice girls to the top , her bid for stardom followed .
single history billie 's chart career because we want to -lrb- july 1998 -rrb- no. 1 girlfriend -lrb- oct 1998 -rrb- no. 1 she wants you -lrb- dec 1998 -rrb- no. 3 honey to the bee -lrb- april 1999 -rrb- no. 3 day and night -lrb- may 2000 -rrb- no. 1 something deep inside -lrb- september 2000 -rrb- no. 3 walk of life -lrb- december 2000 -rrb- no. 25 on 29 june 1998 , her first single , because we want to , was released in the uk .
a jaunty ditty , it featured girly-girly vocals and a " join-in-now " hook -lrb- " why d 'you play that song so loud ?
because we want to , because we want to " -rrb- .
even piper later admitted that she would not have bought it herself .
but the song drove itself into the nation 's consciousness - and to the top of the charts .
billie -lrb- as she was known then -rrb- had become the youngest person ever to go straight to number one with her first single .
more celebrations billie 's photo is never far from the desk of a tabloid picture editor her next single , girlfriend , repeated the feat .
she was now also only the third act in pop history to have their first two singles go straight to the top of the charts .
in december 1998 she was named the best female singer in a leading awards ceremony , and the next year was nominated for two brit awards .
to the agony of acne-ridden 15-year-old boys , she also started dating richie from boy band 5ive .
the cracks i feel numb and heartbroken about ritchie .
i 'm still getting used to being on my own after such a long relationship billie piper but then the cracks began to emerge .
exhaustive promotion led to cancelled appearances .
she had to fly home early from australia in 1999 after catching a flu virus .
more seriously , kidney problems caused her to pull out of a string of european dates in early 2000 , and she collapsed after recording the bbc 's fbi programme .
when , one friday evening in june 2000 , she was rushed to hospital after collapsing in a trendy london nightclub , it seemed like it might all have got a bit too much .
burnt out ?
walk of life : billie 's aptly-named second album just a few weeks before , her 15-month relationship with ritchie had ended .
after being out of the charts for over a year , she seemed to have been overtaken by us teen stars like britney spears and christina aguilera .
at the tender age of 17 , people said billie piper 's career was over .
new look but she brought out a new single , day and night , featuring a more mature , american sound and a raunchier new look .
in day and night , billie piper -lrb- surname now included -rrb- wore a slinky red leather number and danced britney-style moves in a darkened , rain-drenched alley .
it made number one , and re-crowned her as britain 's princess of pop , albeit temporarily .
day and night : the new britney-style look since then her pop career has struggled and her personal life has dominated the tabloids .
the pop princess 's tiara has slipped somewhat .
in december last year her love life became the focus of attention when she began a romance with chris evans , the dj and media mogul .
in february this year a woman was found guilty of making death threats against the singer .
single shelved juliet peters made a barrage of abuse-laden telephone calls on piper record company answering machine and had threatened to decapitate the star and burn her body .
peters walked free from court with an 18-month prison sentence suspended for two years .
although the ruling allowed piper to focus on her career again , it appeared to be on the slide when she and her manager , nicki chapman , parted company .
her last single walk of life only reached number 25 in the chart , her first song not to break the top five .
and a planned single tide is high has been shelved while the star " works on a new album " .
if she can push her music instead of her personal life to the front pages again , then perhaps she can reclaim her pop princess crown .
but that is a big if .

vw said that looking ahead to the current year , it was expecting a further rise of pre-tax profit and sales .
the company forecast comes despite warning of the negative outlook in the auto industry .
" we 're not expecting any impulses from developments in the world auto markets .
in order to reach our profit targets , we 're implementing extensive measures to optimise costs and revenue structures in all markets and regions , " the statement said .
the figures were calculated using for the first time the international accounting standards -lrb- ias -rrb- , to which vw switched this year , as well as the german hgb standard .
the ias figure , for which there was no comparison for last years , was in line with analyst expectations .
using the hgb , first-quarter pre-tax profit rose 15 % to 708m euros -lrb- $ 631m -rrb- and under ias it amounted to 1.25bn euros -lrb- $ 1.1bn -rrb- .
results outlook this year is ferdinand piech 's last full year as chief executive and analysts expect him to deliver a set of strong results as a legacy .
in april , vw had said it aimed to cut costs by up to 2bn deutschmarks this year , but did say where the cuts would be made .
analysts had been hoping for some signs with the first quarter results but received none .
the company 's uk operations of rolls-royce / bentley were still affected by ongoing costs for the development of a new product range , it said .
sales up in the first quarter , vw 's unit sales rose 0.6 % , despite weakening markets in both germany and in the united states .
deliveries to us customers fell 6.8 % in the first quarter , while deliveries in germany fell 9.4 % .
vw shares are currently trading at the level where they started the year .

contentious issues in textbooks dismissed the nanjing massacre as " nothing like a holocaust " described the invasion of the korean peninsula as an unopposed annexation , necessary for japan 's security alleged that japan 's wartime rule prepared asian countries for independence from european colonial masters south korea is furious about the books and foreign minister han seung-soo has summoned japan 's ambassador to seoul to hand him a list of proposals for changing them .
the list was compiled after a panel of government officials and experts spent several weeks analysing the books .
the new japanese premier has said that the books could not be " revised again " as they had already been approved by the education ministry with certain modifications .
" but we need to take sincerely what the republic of korea says and study what steps we can take in the future as there are differences in the perceptions of historians on both sides , " he said .
widespread outcry south korea has been at the forefront of asian protests over the books , which have emerged as a pressing problem for mr koizumi since he took office on 26 april .
seoul has requested changes to 35 passages in eight newly-approved textbooks .
most of the disputed passages are contained in one history book written by a group of japanese nationalist historians .
