the taleban has finally agreed to grant access to the eight detainees , who include two australians , two americans , and four germans .
the aid workers , held on charges of illegally preaching christianity , have not been seen by diplomats or relatives since they were arrested on 5 august .
taleban foreign minister wakil ahmed muttawakil told the reuters news agency : " i have given the authorisation for the issue of visas . "
according to the australian foreign office , visas may be issued as early as monday and the diplomats would fly into kabul on tuesday .
the announcement marks an about-turn from the taleban who had refused to allow access to the arrested eight , or to 16 afghan employees of the same aid agency , the germany-based shelter now international .
last week , diplomats from the us , australia and germany tried unsuccessfully to visit their nationals .
pressure red cross officials in kabul have also confirmed that they had been given permission to see the aid workers - two americans , four germans and two australians .
but spokesman mario musa was quoted as saying that the details of the visit still had to be finalised .
a pakistan-based afghan news agency said the icrc could be allowed to visit the detainees on sunday .
diplomats suspected the taleban were keeping the aid workers isolated to pressure them into confessing .
foreign minister muttawakil said the visits were now possible because " the first important phase of the investigation is coming to an end . "
the taleban claims to have discovered bibles and christian cd-roms in the local languages from the organisation 's premises .
un warning united nations secretary-general kofi annan had accused the taleban of violating international law by denying the detainees consular access .
mr annan warned that the continued detention of the aid workers could affect crucial humanitarian assistance to afghanistan , which is suffering from the effects of war , poverty and drought .
the eight aid workers face trial under taleban laws , although it is unclear which ones might apply to foreigners .
two different decrees cover the crime of trying to persuade an afghan to renounce islam .
one applies to foreigners and orders deportation after a short prison term .
the other stipulates death for any afghan who converts as well as the person who instigated the conversion .

but milosevic was not the first former head of government to stand trial for genocide .
that notorious distinction went to jean kambanda who was prime minister of rwanda in 1994 when almost one million tutsis and moderate hutus were slaughtered .
milosevic - not the first head of state to strand trial for genocide kambanda was tried at the international criminal tribunal at arusha in neighbouring tanzania .
the highway which connects kilimanjaro airport in the north of tanzania with the town of arusha cuts through lush plantations of banana and coffee .
masai tribesmen swathed in red blankets sell artefacts by the roadside .
the acrid tang of wood smoke hangs in the air .
it 's a familiar tableau of east africa .
and when a sign appears saying : " you are exactly halfway between the cape and cairo , " you can almost believe that , despite the passage of years , cecil rhodes and stanley livingstone would feel reassuringly at home here .
almost - but not quite .
because the idea that in arusha , the drumbeat of international justice could be louder and more insistent than that of traditional african tribalism would have seemed absurd , never mind a century , even a decade ago .
and yet the war crimes tribunal for rwanda which has been sitting in this remote and dusty town since 1997 , is as genuinely ground-breaking as the victorian visionaries who carved up the continent .
storm of rebuke but that has n't staunched the criticism .
barely a month goes by without another assault on the slowness , the sheer incompetence , the lack of professional balance , the petty un politicking which - so it 's alleged - has hamstrung this court and prevented it from fulfilling its mandate. is the west - having abandoned rwanda 's tutsis and moderate hutus to their fate seven years ago - now allowing , even encouraging , impossible yardsticks by which to measure justice ?
it 's a cacophony in comparison to which complaints about the functioning of the other international criminal tribunal in the hague are the merest whispers .
so what 's going on here ?
is arusha just the latest evidence that nothing african works ?
or , is the west - having abandoned rwanda 's tutsis and moderate hutus to their fate seven years ago - now allowing , even encouraging , impossible yardsticks by which to measure justice ?
trading statistics does n't help much .
the critics point out that since 1997 , only nine trials have been completed at arusha .
and that some defendants have languished in custody for years .
yet , more than 50 of those indicted for war crimes in rwanda are under arrest - a far higher proportion than at the yugoslav tribunal in the hague .
augustin misago was first roman catholic bishop to go on trial on charges of genocide despite the hullabaloo about milosevic , arusha was the first court to convict a former head of government of genocide .
and the first to establish that rape was a crime against humanity .
but arusha is not the hague .
the perfect jumping-off point for safari trips it may be - but it was nobody 's first choice for a war crimes tribunal .
when nairobi was ruled out by kenya 's president daniel arap moi , arusha was thrust into the limelight .
though perhaps that 's not the word to use .
there are power cuts almost every day - and before the court installed its own generator , lawyers working late got used to studying their briefs by candle .
even at noon , parts of the building are as inviting as an unused store-room - only the brilliant greens and yellows of some of the outfits worn by the africans illuminate the stygian gloom .
the photocopiers and facsimile machines - when they 're functioning - work at a snail 's pace .
and the offices are cramped .
' poor justice ' but the physical surroundings are trivial compared to the quality of justice .
one anglo-saxon prosecutor told me that some of the judicial appointments were sheer un tokenism .
third world judges with little or no trial experience , way out of their depth , he said .
dramatic though the appearance of milosevic was in the dock at the hague - and i was there to see it - nobody should under-estimate what 's happening at arusha name here some african defence lawyers have been accused of spinning out proceedings because their daily rate at arusha is a fortune compared to what they 'd be getting at home .
as an example , visiting journalists are told about the notorious " yoghurt " motion - when counsel petitioned the court because his client was n't served yoghurt in detention .
but let 's keep a sense of proportion .
who now devalues the nuremberg tribunal because goering 's lawyer was a bombastic time-waster ?
or , because to get to the courthouse , you had to pick your way through the rubble of allied firebombing ?
and dramatic though the appearance of milosevic was in the dock at the hague - and i was there to see it - nobody should under-estimate what 's happening at arusha .
it 's already paved the way for another ad hoc war crimes tribunal , in sierra leone .
and it 's providing the template for the permanent international criminal court which might just make the world a more civilised place .
for once , something uplifting may have come out of africa .

they are forsaking breathable jackets , fleece caps and waterproof trousers to don tweed jackets , trilby hats and plus-fours , complete with braces and bow-ties .
the seven climbers are trying to draw attention to the changes in mountaineering - and to the alps themselves - in the last 150 years .
they are retracing the now well-worn routes of some of the early pioneers in a 10-day expedition .
but far from being isolated from the outside world , they are charting their journey on the internet , sending daily e-mail despatches to bbc news online and taking part in a live forum from mount eiger .
the age of tourism the british were the first to turn alpine mountaineering into a leisure pursuit in the second half of the 19th century .
male attire : norfolk jacket waistcoat pocket watch shirt and collar cufflinks and tie breeches or plus-fours long woollen stockings lace-up garters it became fashionable for the rich and famous - including the poets byron and shelley - to hire swiss guides to take them up previously unconquered peaks .
but with the development of mountain railways in the early 20th century , the alps became more accessible .
climbers today complain that even the highest peaks are overrun by crowds of camera-clicking tourists , who have been delivered to the mountain summits by the vast network of cable-cars , ski-lifts and trains .
receding glaciers the expedition , sponsored by the news and information multimedia group , aims to retrace some of the most famous routes , and document the ways in which the sport and landscape have evolved .
" we are retracing the steps of the early pioneers .
but to some extent this is impossible as the environment has changed so much , " said project leader dale bechtel .
" we will be crossing glaciers that are already some 200 metres lower than they were then .
" and as glaciers retreat , they often cause mudslides and floods .
so some villages that were built close to the glaciers have been washed away . "
frocks and bloomers the swissinfo group has spent months researching their costumes to make the experience as authentic as possible .
this posed a particular challenge for the female member of the party , british climber alison henry .
she is wearing a full-length tweed skirt over silk underwear and long johns , a tweed jacket , a knee-length canvas poncho and a wide-brimmed felt hat .
" i imagine i 'll always be too cold or too hot or too wet , " she said before setting out .
" but until i 've had the experience of a heavy wet tweed flapping around my ankles , it 's difficult to imagine what it 'll be like . "
the swiss guides are wearing the uniform of the grindelwald guides from the latter half of the 19th century , which was designed in the same style as the mountaineering costume of the british climbers .
" the swiss guides wanted to travel with the english because they were gentlemen , and so they also wanted to look like them , " said mr bechtel .
safety concerns although the group say they are not taking unnecessary risks , several people have died recently on the same route .
if you take one wrong step on a steep snow slope you could slip and fall , and pull others with you dale bechtel " it 's a low-risk route , but there are always unknown factors , " said mr bechtel .

the longer you leave it , the less likely you are to find much sign of the glaciers .
they have drawn generations of climbers and tourists to the alps from europe and beyond .
but since 1850 , western europe 's glacial area has shrunk by up to 40 % , and the volume by more than 50 % .
the melting is happening , and it appears to be gathering pace .
scientists from zurich university have monitored two specific regions of the swiss alps , the engadin and the simplon , for approaching half a century .
this year they reported " a pronounced and dramatic shrinkage of both the extent and number of ice bodies " .
" in the engadin " , they said , " 24 of the investigated 54 ice patches have vanished since 1955 .
in the simplon area , 10 of 31 ice bodies have melted away completely since 1967 . "
sub-surface melting longer-term studies suggest that the alpine glaciers have been retreating for the last 150 years , and some scientists believe they could disappear completely by 2050 .
the melt is on across the alps satellite studies carried out by the us geological survey 's glims project -lrb- global land ice measurement from space -rrb- reported evidence in june 2001 of glacier shrinkage in the pyrenees , between france and spain .
the number of spanish glaciers has fallen from 27 in 1980 to 13 today .
it is not only the glaciers themselves that are warming , but the rock and soil beneath the surface as well .
scientists have discovered that europe 's permafrost , the frozen earth covering mountain areas like the alps , is melting .
underground temperatures have risen by nearly a degree in the past decade - three times faster than at any other time in the last century .
buildings and villages will be increasingly at risk .
further afield , the rate of glacier retreat in russia 's caucasus mountains is about the same as switzerland 's .
sign of change beyond europe , the ice fields on the summit of kilimanjaro in east africa could melt completely in the next 20 years if the earth continues to warm at the rate many scientists expect , according to professor lonnie thompson , of ohio state university , us .
he said comparisons with previous mapping showed 33 % of kilimanjaro 's ice had disappeared in the last two decades - 82 % had gone since 1912 .
melting permafrost threatens installations professor thompson said quelccaya in peru , the only true ice cap in the tropics , had retreated 32 times faster in the last two years -lrb- 1998-2000 -rrb- than during the 20 years from 1963 to 1983 .
" as a result of recent global warming , many tropical glaciers around the globe may disappear completely by 2020 .
apart from the dramatic impact this will have on local communities , it is also a potent sign that the earth is undergoing enormous changes , " he said .
warmest yet a global study of 160,000 mountain glaciers and ice caps shows that the volume of the world 's glaciers is declining , and that the rate of ice loss is continuing to speed up .
it is the smaller glaciers at low latitudes that seem to be worst affected , though there is evidence of loss in mid-latitudes as well .
the glaciers of the tien shan mountains between russia and china have lost 22 % of their ice volume in the last 40 years , while ice cores from eastern tibet show the last 50 years to have been the warmest yet .
until recently , though , there seems to have been little change in high-latitude glaciers , especially in the arctic . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's alex kirby reports special report alpine route tracker alpinism : then and now eiger 's grim reputation warm-up in the alps tourism 's alpine toll forum quiz alpine climbers see also : 29 mar 01 -pipe- south asia pakistan considers melting glaciers 19 feb 01 -pipe- san francisco kilimanjaro 's white peak to disappear 07 jan 01 -pipe- europe europe 's warm weather chaos internet links : international geosphere-biosphere programme cyberalps glims world glacier monitoring service permafrost and climate in europe the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top sci / tech stories now : astronomy 's next big thing ancient rock points to life 's origin mobile spam on the rise giant telescope project gets boost new hope for aids vaccine replace your mouse with your eye device could detect overdose drugs wireless internet arrives in china links to more sci / tech stories are at the foot of the page .

according to the sri lankan military , six rebels were killed and nine injured , while 12 soldiers were wounded in the attack which began at dawn .
the army is playing down the scale of the attack , but the rebels seem to be suggesting it was a fairly major assault on their positions .
first news of the fighting came from the voice of tigers , the rebels ' clandestine radio station which broadcasts from the jungles of northern sri lanka .
contrasting claims voice of tigers said government troops had tried to advance on their positions from three different angles , which would suggest an attack involving large numbers of troops .
the radio station said the tigers had launched an operation to repulse the attack and succeeded in pushing back government forces on all three flanks , inflicting serious damage to the sri lankan military .
by contrast , the military called it a limited clearing operation ahead of the forward defence line .
a statement from the military said they had succeeded in destroying the first line of the rebels ' defences and had recovered four rifles in the process .
there is no independent confirmation of either side 's account of the fighting but reports from jaffna say people near the area have heard the sound of shelling and helicopter attacks .
what is clear is that the sri lankan military , by its own admission , has attacked tiger positions in the jaffna peninsula at a time when there is reported to be growing concern in the military about the possibility of a rebel attack on the town of jaffna .
jaffna threat jaffna is currently under sri lankan military control but was ruled by the tigers for five years in the 1990s .
a recent statement from the tigers threatened to recapture the town very soon , and there are reports that the military has been bolstering its defences there .
it is possible that this could be a pre-emptive strike aimed at preventing an attack by the tigers .
peace moves being brokered by norway to end the 18-year conflict are currently deadlocked .
