the wylfa station on anglesey has been out of operation for almost a year after the discovery of faults at the plant prompted safety concerns its owners bnfl magnox said they were working on plans to start electricity regeneration there .
but campaigners from the pressure group greenpeace said wylfa should not be allowed to re-open .
the station , which opened in 1970 and has a licence until 2004 , developed faults on welds holding pipes in place where they enter the reactor last april .
safety problems now bnfl magnox has come up with a solution to the problem and said it has begun work which would take two to three months to complete .
the nuclear installations inspectorate would then have to approve the restarting of the reactor .
members of greenpeace are to tell assembly members on wednesday that safety problems at the station can only increase as the plant ages .
they are expected to say that the administration should begin instead preparing for the economic impact of closing the site .
last month bnfl said they have dropped the option to use magrox fuel to power the anglesey plant - which has been closed for the last nine months because of problems with welds in the reactors .
the company said it is looking to see if there is an alternative technical option to magrox which would allow the station to extend its life beyond 2012 .
bnfl said their decision was made on purely commercial grounds and was a business decision .
a hard look had been taken at the long-term value of magrox to the company .

the actions and policies of the government of iran continue to threaten the national security , foreign policy , and economy of the united states george w bush president putin of russia said that moscow would continue to sell arms to iran following talks in moscow with iranian president mohammed khatami .
the us administration responded warily on tuesday to russia 's decision , saying us officials did not know which weapons or technology was involved .
us secretary of state colin powell and national security adviser condoleezza rice will get a chance to question sergei ivanov , the russian security chief , when he visits washington on wednesday .
sanctions president george w bush said in the order renewing sanctions that he was taking the step " because the actions and policies of the government of iran continue to threaten the national security , foreign policy , and economy of the united states " .
the sanctions were imposed by former president bill clinton in 1995 and were set to expire on thursday .
but white house national security council spokeswoman mary ellen countryman said mr bush retained the ability to modify or end them .
the sanctions , imposed under the international emergency economic powers act , mainly affect us petroleum companies , barring them from investing in iran 's energy sector .
there are certain things which quite clearly would cause serious concern to the us and serious ramifications state department spokesman richard boucher the us accuses iran of sponsoring terrorism , seeking to sabotage arab-israeli peace efforts , and commiting human rights abuses .
iran has urged the us to lift its sanctions , saying it would buy us exports if us markets were opened to iranian goods .
in moscow , the chief foreign affairs official at the russian defence ministry col-gen leonid ivashov , said on monday that the scope of russia 's arms accord with iran is a private matter between two sovereign states .
' defensive weapons ' president putin said that iran had asked for defensive weapons only , and had the right to defend itself .
the state department spokesman , richard boucher said washington was still not clear about what type of " defensive weapons " mr putin was referring to .
but he said that any russian sale to iran of advanced conventional weapons , missiles or missile technology would draw a strong us response .
" the first important thing is to find out what they mean by ' defensive ' weapons , what they intend to sell , and whether they have any contracts " he pointed out .
iran state radio said the us administration would " gain nothing " but a " deepening of the chasm " between tehran and washington , who have had frosty relations since iran 's 1979 revolution .
russia sold some $ 5bn in weapons to iran from 1985 to 1995 but stopped when then president boris yeltsin agreed with the clinton administration to end the relationship .

residents of senahu , 370 km -lrb- 231 miles -rrb- north of guatemala city , also took at least four local police officers hostage , according to officials .
the peasants gathered outside the court on tuesday , where there was an exchange of words with the judge , who got out his weapon and wounded two peasants .
the crowd responded by beating the judge and attacking him with machetes and sticks .
national civil police spokesman faustino sanchez said two people were injured .
" the judge shot two people and then the crowd killed him with sticks and machetes , " mr sanchez said .
the spokesman said that the special police force -lrb- fep -rrb- commandos sent to the area to try to free the hostages have been unable to enter the town because of opposition from the neighbours .
mob lynching is not uncommon in impoverished and crime-ridden guatemala .
mob justice had claimed at least three lives in the country so far this year , according to faustino sanchez .
experts say a legacy of violence remains in the country , which in 1996 emerged from a 36-year civil war that killed 200,000 people , mostly mayan peasants .

over the last year kingfisher 's pre-tax pre-exceptional profits fell to £ 605.8m -lrb- $ 880.9m -rrb- which was within analysts expectations .
investors may be surprised by the announcement that kingfisher is not buying out the rest of its majority owned french diy business castorama .
when sir geoffrey mulcahy revealed the company 's demerger strategy he said they would focus on diy and consumer electronics .
demerger " progressing well " kingfisher said it was continuing to review offers for its general merchandise businesses superdrug and woolworths , although deals had not yet been finalised .
sir geoffrey said plans for the demerger were " progressing well " and that they were still on schedule " for implementation in the second quarter " .
speculation had grown that kingfisher could sell superdrug to dutch pharmacy group kruidvat or to germany 's schlecker , but there was no announcement .
poor sales the figures reflect poor results from woolworths , which lost £ 31m , and promarkt , the german electrical retailer , which lost more than £ 19m .
promarkt is the second biggest electrical store in germany and the management has just been replaced .
both chains have tight margins because of intense price competition in their markets .
kingfisher says most of its other businesses performed well , and overall sales increased by 11 % to £ 12bn .
