" strong dollar " policy remains us treasury secretary paul o 'neill has used a television interview to try and stamp on speculation that the us administration is backing off from its " strong dollar " policy .
he also held out hopes for a turnaround , saying the us is " on the threshold of recovery " .
with the dollar sinking against all the major world currencies , mr o 'neill was at pains to stress that the decline was nothing to do with government policy .
" one of the things i 've learned in this job is that there is no upside in talking about the dollar , " he said .
" we have a continuing , continuous policy and that is all there is to say . "
imf trigger his comments follow intense pressure on the greenback , triggered in part by an imf snapshot of the us economy which warned that the trade deficit is spiralling out of control .
the deficit could well spark a depreciation of the dollar , the imf said in the report .
the slide accelerated on 15 august , with the dollar down below 120 yen for the first time in two months .
the us currency was worth 1.0957 euros , a five-month low , and against the pound sterling it hit a three-month low .

we have a continuing , continuous policy and that is all there is to say us treasury secretary paul o 'neill department of commerce figures released on 15 august , for example , showed inventories shrinking 0.4 % in july .
huge inventory write-offs have been a key feature of the huge losses reported by us companies this year .
" i think that we 've now put behind us seven months worth of a correction process with inventories going down , and i think we 're now on the threshold of improvement , " he said .
" hopefully , moving into the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2002 , we 're going to move back more toward our real potential . "
when asked whether he thought the us had already seen the worst of the downturn , he said : " i certainly hope so . "
even so , other data was less positive , with business sales falling 1.4 % , the worst fall since august 1992 .
tax cut assistance the treasury secretary also pointed to the tax cut the bush administration brought in earlier this year , now feeding through to consumers , which he said was worth $ 200bn .
" even in a $ 10,000bn economy , it is a significant jolt , " he said .
while the downturn has been led by slowing business investment rather than consumer spending , mr o 'neill insisted that the added spending would still help companies by encouraging them to invest so as to attract the additional spending .

meanwhile , a military spokesman in nicaragua has created a further diplomatic scare in the region , accusing honduras of planning a surprise military attack on nicaragua - allegations which honduras denies .
the diplomatic spat that 's developed between the three countries is the fiercest in recent years .
the underlying issue is a long-standing territorial dispute .
incriminating material honduran officials said that the diplomats had been expelled after being found with documents , videos and photographs on affairs of national security .
el salvador 's ambassador in honduras contests this .
he says he wants an explanation for the expulsions , which he claims breached the rules of diplomatic immunity .
perhaps more worrying for regional stability have been the claims made by an official in nicaragua of a military build-up in honduras which he says signal a possible attack on his country .
honduran officials say they have no such intentions .
border row the subtext of this round of regional animosity lies in a long-running dispute over territorial and fishing rights in the gulf of fonseca , a pacific inlet shared by the three countries .
it was , in part , this border dispute that led to a brief but bloody conflict between el salvador and honduras in 1969 in which 600 people died .
a ruling by the international court of justice in the hague in 1992 shared out the disputed territories but mapping of the new borders has been slow .
the current tensions are likely to delay the moment of any definitive resolution yet further .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- paraguay football hero taunts brazil categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : americas front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 16 august , 2001 , 05:38 gmt 06:38 uk paraguay football hero taunts brazil chilavert is famous for making political statements the captain of paraguay 's national football team , jose luis chilavert , has suggested that brazil should return territory it seized during a war between the two countries more than a century ago .
in the run-up to wednesday 's crucial world cup encounter , chilavert complained that the brazilian media were blowing the match totally out of proportion , and treating it like a war .
if we 're going to talk about war , let 's hope that brazil returns the lands it took from paraguay jose luis chilavert the paraguayan captain said that if wars were mentioned , perhaps brazil could return the land it took from his country - including the world-famous iguazu falls - in a five-year war which ended in 1870 .
brazil won the match 2-0 to give their qualifying chances for 2002 a much-needed fillip .
marcelinho paraiba 's opened the scoring in the fifth minute with his first international goal , and rivaldo 's header in the 70th put the match beyond doubt .
brazil 's lacklustre performance so far has left the team in danger of failing to reach the world cup finals for the first time in the tournament 's history .
the team remains four in the south american qualifying group , with 24 points , but have closed the gap on second place paraguay , with 26 points .
only the top four team out of 10 qualify .
coach 's backing the paraguayan captain was backed up in his pre-match comments by team coach sergio makarian , a uruguayan .
makarian criticised the brazilian attitude and said he disagreed with such attempts to turn the game into anything more than a sporting confrontation .
chilavert , who is also the paraguayan goalkeeper , became an international name when he took his team to the second round of the world cup finals in france in 1998 .
he is also renowned for making political statements .
he refused to play in the 1999 copa america , hosted by paraguay , saying that money should have been spent on improving schools and hospitals rather than stadia for the tournament .
paraguay was heavily defeated in the 1865-70 war by the triple alliance of uruguay , brazil and argentina , losing a considerable part of its male population and large tracts of land .

in the run-up to wednesday 's crucial world cup encounter , chilavert complained that the brazilian media were blowing the match totally out of proportion , and treating it like a war .
if we 're going to talk about war , let 's hope that brazil returns the lands it took from paraguay jose luis chilavert the paraguayan captain said that if wars were mentioned , perhaps brazil could return the land it took from his country - including the world-famous iguazu falls - in a five-year war which ended in 1870 .
brazil won the match 2-0 to give their qualifying chances for 2002 a much-needed fillip .
marcelinho paraiba 's opened the scoring in the fifth minute with his first international goal , and rivaldo 's header in the 70th put the match beyond doubt .
brazil 's lacklustre performance so far has left the team in danger of failing to reach the world cup finals for the first time in the tournament 's history .
the team remains four in the south american qualifying group , with 24 points , but have closed the gap on second place paraguay , with 26 points .
only the top four team out of 10 qualify .
coach 's backing the paraguayan captain was backed up in his pre-match comments by team coach sergio makarian , a uruguayan .
makarian criticised the brazilian attitude and said he disagreed with such attempts to turn the game into anything more than a sporting confrontation .
chilavert , who is also the paraguayan goalkeeper , became an international name when he took his team to the second round of the world cup finals in france in 1998 .
he is also renowned for making political statements .
he refused to play in the 1999 copa america , hosted by paraguay , saying that money should have been spent on improving schools and hospitals rather than stadia for the tournament .
paraguay was heavily defeated in the 1865-70 war by the triple alliance of uruguay , brazil and argentina , losing a considerable part of its male population and large tracts of land .
much of the blame for the conflict is thought to lie with the then paraguayan dictator , solana lopez , for declaring war on brazil over its involvement in uruguay 's civil war .

the world 's second largest economy grew by just 0.1 % in the first three months of the year , and did not shrink 0.2 % as originally announced in june , the government said on thursday .
gdp gross domestic product is the value of all goods and services a country produces .
the revised gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- for the first quarter follows 0.6 % growth in the quarter to december and rules out japan falling into a technical recession in the first half of this year .
a recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth .
the revised gdp figure came one day after the bank of japan lowered its economic outlook for the third consecutive month and easing of monetary policy by the bank of japan earlier in the week .
koizumi 's good news the figures are good news for prime minister junichiro koizumi who faces a tough job to promote painful economic structural reforms .
the growth reflects stronger personal consumption and business investment than earlier thought , translated into growth of 1.0 % last year , up from 0.9 % .
second-quarter gdp will be announced next month .
japan has been trying for more than 10 years to lift itself out of an economic downturn that has been sharpened by the slowdown in overseas demand , especially in the us .
japan has an export oriented economy and the us is its largest trading partner .

members of both farming unions in wales will be meeting welsh rural affairs minister carwyn jones .
later roads across the brecon beacons in powys will be closed to allow the continuing cull of sheep there .
crisis in wales total confirmed cases in wales - 118 powys - 78 cases anglesey - 13 cases monmouthshire - 21 cases caerphilly 2 rhondda cynon taff - 1 neath port talbot -1 newport - 3 thursday 's meeting between leaders of the national farmers union cymru -lrb- nfu -rrb- and the farmers ' union of wales -lrb- fuw -rrb- and carwyn jones and the chief veterinary officer for wales will focus on the issue of vaccination .
the unions and mr jones himself have been against a vaccination programme in the fight against foot-and-mouth .
but farmers in the brecon beacons , where culling of diseased animals continues unabated , have thought vaccination should have been introduced months ago .
disease-free status is seen as vital to regain the valuable export market for welsh meat .
deputy president glyn powell said : " the fuw believes it is important that the issue of vaccination is fully discussed in order for the minister to explain in detail why vaccination is not an option at this time . " .
carwyn jones : against vaccination nfu cymru president hugh richards meanwhile will use the meeting to call for help in dealing with the " massive backlog of cattle " which are too old to enter the food chain .
the over thirty month scheme was restarted in england in july , and there is concern in wales that the scheme should be restarted here if further welfare problems are to be avoided .
mr richards sais the backlog has meant older stock has had to be kept on farms , adding further to the pressures of over-crowding and diminishing feed stocks .
meanwhile , people visiting the brecon beacons will encounter road closures later on thursday as the precautionary cull there continues .
the road junction between the a4059 and a470 down towards hirwaun will be closed on from 13.00 to 18.00 bst on thursday .
the latest cull will take place bear the a4059 in powys , north of the boundary with rhondda cynon taff .
the carcasses of the sheep will be removed in sealed lorries .
