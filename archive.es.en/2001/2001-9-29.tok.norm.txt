in an interview in the parliamentary house magazine , mr martin said lobbyists were his biggest worry .
" there are those who would say the only way to reach an mp or a minister is through them , " the former glasgow sheet-metal worker said .
he said in some cases they acted as a barrier between electors and the elected .
some of them were very bad-mannered about it , and i used to chase them off michael martin " they put up a barrier between mps and ministers , and those who want to reach parliament .
" they are doing a disservice to the house . "
mr martin said he took pride in making himself available to his constituents .
he also warned ministers they had to keep spin doctors under control .
" my place of work is the house of commons , " he said .
" as far as i am concerned , spin doctors simply do not exist .
" i remember them from my time on the select committees .
' clod about ' " they used to clod about the place .
some of them would come on to the dais .
" some of them were very bad-mannered about it , and i used to chase them off . "
mr martin continued : " i talk to ministers .
the minister is the engineer .
sacked mps " i do not want to deal with the apprentice .
" if i find a situation - and i have not so far - where a spin doctor is interfering in the work of an mp , i would have no hesitation in pulling them in and talking to them . "
mr martin also welcomed the commons ' decision to reinstate two outspoken labour mps sacked by the government from their posts as chairmen of two key parliamentary committees .
gwyneth dunwoody and donald anderson were restored to the transport and foreign affairs select committees respectively after a debate in parliament .
' empty benches ' and the speaker said that vote had been a good thing .
he also appealed to mps to fill up the " empty green benches " in the chamber .
mr martin said the fact that mps have television feeds in their offices might have reduced attendance .
but he concluded : " there is no substitute for the real thing . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- manufacturing job cuts warning categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 29 september , 2001 , 09:26 gmt 10:26 uk manufacturing job cuts warning union says industry faces jobs " haemorrhage " the manufacturing , science and finance union has warned that at least 100,000 manufacturing jobs will be lost before the end of the year unless interest rates are cut further .
the union says industry faces a " jobs haemorrhage " unless action is taken to stave off recession .
the bank of england 's monetary policy committee , which last week trimmed uk rates by a quarter point to 4.75 % , was urged to cut rates by a further 0.75 % when it meets next week .
" the us and european central banks have cut their interest rates right back to defend their economies and our mpc must throw their misplaced caution to the wind to protect our economy , " said msf general secretary roger lyons .
" we are in the midst of a global crisis .
now is not the time for half measures and tinkering around the fringes . "
another us move ?
twelve days ago , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- cut eurozone interest rates by a half point , following a similar move by the us federal reserve in the wake of the 11 september terrorist attacks .
and many economists believe the fed will announce another rate cut - its ninth this year - at its meeting scheduled for 2 october .
although viewed by some economists as a blunt instrument , the aim of any cut would be to encourage consumer and business spending , limiting the length and depth of economic downturn .
eurozone rates stand at 3.75 % while us rates are at 3 % .
thousands of manufacturing jobs have been lost in the past few days because of the economic fallout from the us terror attacks .
jobless claims the us labor department reported that the number of new jobless claims rose by 58,000 to 450,000 for the week ending 22 september , well above analysts ' expectations , with 11,000 new claims coming in new york city alone .
since the attacks , the aviation industry alone has laid off over 100,000 workers .

the union says industry faces a " jobs haemorrhage " unless action is taken to stave off recession .
the bank of england 's monetary policy committee , which last week trimmed uk rates by a quarter point to 4.75 % , was urged to cut rates by a further 0.75 % when it meets next week .
" the us and european central banks have cut their interest rates right back to defend their economies and our mpc must throw their misplaced caution to the wind to protect our economy , " said msf general secretary roger lyons .
" we are in the midst of a global crisis .
now is not the time for half measures and tinkering around the fringes . "
another us move ?
twelve days ago , the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- cut eurozone interest rates by a half point , following a similar move by the us federal reserve in the wake of the 11 september terrorist attacks .
and many economists believe the fed will announce another rate cut - its ninth this year - at its meeting scheduled for 2 october .
although viewed by some economists as a blunt instrument , the aim of any cut would be to encourage consumer and business spending , limiting the length and depth of economic downturn .
eurozone rates stand at 3.75 % while us rates are at 3 % .
thousands of manufacturing jobs have been lost in the past few days because of the economic fallout from the us terror attacks .
jobless claims the us labor department reported that the number of new jobless claims rose by 58,000 to 450,000 for the week ending 22 september , well above analysts ' expectations , with 11,000 new claims coming in new york city alone .
since the attacks , the aviation industry alone has laid off over 100,000 workers .

planners hope the centre , said to be the biggest millennium attraction outside london , will attract 30,000 visitors in its first year .
the 37,000 square metre building is home to think tank , the city 's new museum of science and technology , an imax cinema and the technology innovation centre .
organisers say the complex is set to become a huge asset to the second city and will lead to the redevelopment of the east side of birmingham .
interactive exhibits the centrepiece is think tank , spread over four floors , containing hundreds of interactive exhibits .
" visitors will discover things they ca n't find anywhere else , " said think tank spokesman mike dernie .
" it shows science of the past , present and future that will engage with visitors .
" they can feel what a digestive system is like or take part in a actual life-saving operation filmed in birmingham .
" they can play the part of the surgeon , nurse or anaesthetist and find out how the medics keep people alive .
" there is a fun approach , it debunks and demystifies science but not in a pompous way , there 's 200 different interactive exhibits .
" it will engage people in the big scientific issues like gm food or technology in health care and their views will be fed back in to the debate to inform that debate . "
historical exhibits go back to the age of steam , visitors will be able to see the oldest working steam engine built in 1779 .
' city asset ' as well as areas dedicated to aircraft , the car and trains visitors will get a taste of the latest technology of the internet and can hook up to a video being shot by astronauts and cosmonauts on board the international space station .
" this will provide a massive impetus to the redevelopment of the east side of birmingham , it will be a huge part of the new birmingham and a great asset , " said mr dernie .
the centre had been joint funded with Â£ 50m from the millennium commission and Â£ 25.6m from the european regional development fund .
but chief executive of think tank , jonathan bryant , is confident the centre will not suffer the same problems as the dome .
" my worry about the dome is that it did n't start from its contents , it started with a great building and thought about what to put in it afterwards .
" we 've built upon the fascinating story about how science changes our lives in the past and in the future and packed it in here . "

the weekend event is seen by cymuned as the first step in the process of drawing up detailed policy solutions to tackle the language crisis in welsh-speaking communities .
the group which was launched earlier this summer as the debate over incomers and saving the welsh language - ignited by councillor seimon glyn from gwynedd - took off .
our discussions on work will concentrate on economic development and the importance of keeping our young people in welsh-speaking communities robat gruffudd set up to protect welsh heartland communities from losing their identity amidst the influx of english incomers , cymuned held its launch meeting at mynytho on the lleyn peninsula in north wales in july .
crymych in pembrokeshire and cardiff have also seen launch meetings of the group .
this weekend 's conference is concentrating on the theme of ' homes , work and language ' and will look at policy in all three areas .
" housing is at the centre of this crisis , " said cymuned spokesman , robat gruffudd .
" we will be looking at the steps that can be taken to tackle the housing and in-migration issue and the effect this has on the survival of welsh as a community language . "
" our discussions on work will concentrate on economic development and the importance of keeping our young people in welsh-speaking communities . "
the continuing row over the future of welsh communities dominated this year 's national eisteddfod at denbigh .
then a former chairman of the welsh language board john elfed jones likened inmigration into wales as a " human form of foot-and-mouth disease .
and a plaid cymru national executive member gwilym ab ioan was forced to resign his position after describing wales as a " dumping ground for oddballs and misfits " mr gruffudd said the debate on language would focus on encouraging and enabling incomers to learn welsh and integrate into the community .
the conference will also be considering ways of strengthening language policies in wales .
" we are proud that cymuned is holding a holistic policy conference like this within a few months of being established .
" it shows that we are serious about tackling the problems that face welsh-speaking wales . "

in recent years , the islands have experienced a steady rise in temperature , which , as the bbc 's rita payne found out , is now posing a serious threat to the country 's environment .
the sea was a vivid turquoise .
tourists were snorkelling as shoals of exotic fish darted through the crystal clear waters .
the sky was a piercing blue and we were on a boat anchored off an island in the seychelles - a tropical paradise .
but the skipper of our boat could n't contain his anger .
he was still simmering over america 's decision to reject the kyoto protocol aimed at curbing global warming .
and one could understand his indignation .
for the seychelles , global warming is not just a distant concept - it 's a matter of survival .
sea temperatures locally have risen by 2c since 1998 , and if the trend continues the consequences could be disastrous .
the danger signs are already there .
walk along any beach and you can pick up scraps of bleached coral washed up by the waves .
the seas off the seychelles were renowned for brilliant coral reefs .
most of the coral is now dead , a casualty of climate warming .
besides the coral , the islands ' giant tortoises could also be at risk .
kevin , the chief warden of the marine national reserve on curieuse island , pointed to a group of tortoises munching contentedly on leaves .
one had ambled across to have its neck stroked to the delight of visitors .
at one time , the tortoises roamed freely on the islands and numbers were high , despite being a popular source of fresh meat for passing sailors .
the sex of a tortoise is determined by temperature .
if temperatures continue to rise the male / female ratio could become unbalanced .
and after the eggs hatch , if temperatures are still too high , the young tortoises could die from dehydration or suffocate to death .
the neighbouring island of cousin has been designated a bird sanctuary .
here , we found the white fairy tern , the graceful long-tailed tropical bird , and other rare species swooping and diving above the trees .
the authorities have a rigorous programme to keep the island free of predators , with the result that there could be few places in the world where birds are so unfazed by visitors .
our tour guide led us through the forest trail pointing out birds nesting on branches of trees and in the crevices of rocks , apparently undisturbed by the daily sight of tourists trudging through their territory .
the coco de mer within touching distance were fluffy fairy tern chicks waiting for the parent birds to feed them .
any pronounced change in climatic conditions could destroy the insects , seeds and aquatic life that keep these rare birds alive .
perhaps one of the best-known products of the seychelles is the coco de mer .
many myths are associated with this giant nut , which has the rounded shape of a woman 's anatomy .
according to local folklore , the male palm moves across at night to the female palm to mate ; anyone , according to legend , who sees the palms mating , will die - a strong disincentive to voyeurs !
in the past , the fronds of the coco de mer palm were used to make thatch roofs , the jelly inside the seed was considered a delicacy and the hard shell was carved into bowls , spoons and nick-knacks for tourists .
these days the unauthorised sale of coco de mer or any products made from it is banned .
this does n't stop some locals though from poaching the fruit to sell to tourists .
the second largest island in the seychelles is praslin , one of the few places where coco de mer palms can be seen growing in their natural state .
the warden of a local reserve noted worrying signs that climatic changes are affecting the growth of the palm .
he says the dry season seems to be longer and this could account for their stunted growth .
also under threat is another species distinctive to the seychelles - the takamaka tree , with its thick , waxy green leaves .
because the wood is tough and water-resistant , the tree is in demand for building boats and houses .
but the takamaka tree has been struck by a mysterious disease , which is also being linked to rising temperatures .
leaves are withering and branches are showing signs of decay .
in a move to stop the disease from spreading , the government has forbidden people to cut down the trees or transport them from one island to another .
concern for the future the seychelles is one of the world 's most environmentally conscious countries .
people are acutely aware of being custodians of their natural heritage .
everyone we met in shops , hotels , or out on the streets , talked about the dangers of unrestrained tourism and climatic change .
and this awareness starts early with wildlife clubs in all school .
students are encouraged to take an active part in environment protection programmes .
a long-term resident said five to six metres of land had been washed away since he was a child .
streams are drying up and for the first time in recent years water controls have been introduced in the seychelles .
despite this , the seychelles still retains all the features one associates with a perfect holiday retreat : a dream landscape ; spectacular granite rocks ; isolated , palm-fringed , silky white beaches ; an abundance of fruit and flowers ; rare animals and birds .
but the people are also keenly aware of the fragility of their surroundings .
back on our boat , the skipper acknowledged that his government was facing a tough challenge : how to maintain strict measures to protect the environment without scaring off tourists who are vital for the economy of the seychelles .
we need support , he pleaded , from the rest of the world .
if rich countries like the united states do n't act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , in a few years there will be nothing left for tourists to enjoy .

the seas off the seychelles were renowned for brilliant coral reefs .
most of the coral is now dead , a casualty of climate warming .
one of the islands ' giant tortoises besides the coral , the islands ' giant tortoises could also be at risk .
kevin , the chief warden of the marine national reserve on curieuse island , pointed to a group of tortoises munching contentedly on leaves .
one had ambled across to have its neck stroked to the delight of visitors .
at one time , the tortoises roamed freely on the islands and numbers were high , despite being a popular source of fresh meat for passing sailors .
the sex of a tortoise is determined by temperature .
if temperatures continue to rise the male / female ratio could become unbalanced .
and after the eggs hatch , if temperatures are still too high , the young tortoises could die from dehydration or suffocate to death .
fairy terns are under threat the neighbouring island of cousin has been designated a bird sanctuary .
here , we found the white fairy tern , the graceful long-tailed tropical bird , and other rare species swooping and diving above the trees .
the authorities have a rigorous programme to keep the island free of predators , with the result that there could be few places in the world where birds are so unfazed by visitors .
our tour guide led us through the forest trail pointing out birds nesting on branches of trees and in the crevices of rocks , apparently undisturbed by the daily sight of tourists trudging through their territory .
the coco de mer within touching distance were fluffy fairy tern chicks waiting for the parent birds to feed them .
any pronounced change in climatic conditions could destroy the insects , seeds and aquatic life that keep these rare birds alive .
perhaps one of the best-known products of the seychelles is the coco de mer .
many myths are associated with this giant nut , which has the rounded shape of a woman 's anatomy .
the fruit of the coco de mer is made into bowls according to local folklore , the male palm moves across at night to the female palm to mate ; anyone , according to legend , who sees the palms mating , will die - a strong disincentive to voyeurs !
in the past , the fronds of the coco de mer palm were used to make thatch roofs , the jelly inside the seed was considered a delicacy and the hard shell was carved into bowls , spoons and nick-knacks for tourists .
these days the unauthorised sale of coco de mer or any products made from it is banned .
this does n't stop some locals though from poaching the fruit to sell to tourists .
the second largest island in the seychelles is praslin , one of the few places where coco de mer palms can be seen growing in their natural state .
the warden of a local reserve noted worrying signs that climatic changes are affecting the growth of the palm .
he says the dry season seems to be longer and this could account for their stunted growth .
traditional houses rely on takamaka wood also under threat is another species distinctive to the seychelles - the takamaka tree , with its thick , waxy green leaves .
because the wood is tough and water-resistant , the tree is in demand for building boats and houses .
but the takamaka tree has been struck by a mysterious disease , which is also being linked to rising temperatures .
leaves are withering and branches are showing signs of decay .
in a move to stop the disease from spreading , the government has forbidden people to cut down the trees or transport them from one island to another .
concern for the future the seychelles is one of the world 's most environmentally conscious countries .
people are acutely aware of being custodians of their natural heritage .
everyone we met in shops , hotels , or out on the streets , talked about the dangers of unrestrained tourism and climatic change .
and this awareness starts early with wildlife clubs in all school .
students are encouraged to take an active part in environment protection programmes .
a long-term resident said five to six metres of land had been washed away since he was a child .
streams are drying up and for the first time in recent years water controls have been introduced in the seychelles .
natural beauty attracts tourists despite this , the seychelles still retains all the features one associates with a perfect holiday retreat : a dream landscape ; spectacular granite rocks ; isolated , palm-fringed , silky white beaches ; an abundance of fruit and flowers ; rare animals and birds .
but the people are also keenly aware of the fragility of their surroundings .
back on our boat , the skipper acknowledged that his government was facing a tough challenge : how to maintain strict measures to protect the environment without scaring off tourists who are vital for the economy of the seychelles .
we need support , he pleaded , from the rest of the world .
if rich countries like the united states do n't act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , in a few years there will be nothing left for tourists to enjoy .
