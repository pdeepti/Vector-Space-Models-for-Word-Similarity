they will be concentrating on events in afghanistan and the middle east and assessing plans to form a european rapid reaction force by 2003 .
the last few months have highlighted how little real power the eu has , and reinforced the determination to do something about it a lot of work needs to be done before the rapid reaction force becomes a viable military capability .
events since 11 september have reinforced the need for the eu to establish a common defence identity .
countries like britain and france have adopted a " go-it-alone " policy in response to the conflict in afghanistan , and have caused considerable resentment among smaller eu member states .
but the last few months have highlighted how little real power the eu has , and reinforced the determination to do something about it .
common defence policy it was as a result of a similar experience during the kosovo conflict in 1999 that the union decided to forge a common defence identity and set up a rapid reaction force .
the aim is for eu member states to be able to deploy collectively by 2003 a force of 60,000 troops within 60 days , independent of nato .
the eu should be able to keep them on the ground for at least a year .
the rapid reaction force is not designed to be a european army , not yet anyway .
it will be a collective force concentrating on a series of tasks - humanitarian relief , peacekeeping and crisis management .
ministers meeting in brussels this week will assess how much work needs to be done to reach that goal .
officials say that about two-thirds of what they call " capability targets " have been met - that includes promises of troops , aircraft and naval vessels .
but there are about 50 shortfalls - many of them militarily significant .
they include things like the ability to suppress enemy air defences , and to air lift large amounts of heavy equipment into operational areas .
airbus in trouble earlier this year eight eu member states announced plans to develop a military version of the airbus - the a400m - to give the union its own military transport capability .
it was seen as a symbol of their commitment to collective european defence .
but the project has already run into trouble , raising doubts about whether countries really will commit hard cash to it .
turkish pique another pressing issue involves turkey , a member of nato but not of the eu .
it fears that it is being shut out of european defence by the new eu initiative , and it is threatening to veto plans to give the eu automatic access to a range of nato assets .
despite these problems , belgium - the current president of the eu - wants to make a formal declaration at the end of this year that the capabilities of the rapid reaction force are " operational " .
it would be little more than a symbolic gesture , although diplomats are confident that they can meet all their targets by 2003 .
" it 's not an on-off switch " , said one european official , briefing reporters in brussels .
" it 's a question of turning up the volume , we 're talking about building capabilities up by 2003 " .
sceptics believe the timetable is too tight , and they question the level of political and financial commitment .
but diplomats insist the project is on course .

the group were detained 10 days ago while on a plane-spotting holiday , and accused of taking photographs of a military airbase .
the examining magistrate is due to meet with a committee of air force experts , to consider a report on the photographs from intelligence officers .
that report was due to be completed last week , but on friday lawyers said it had not yet been forwarded to the magistrate .
the 12 all deny taking photographs inside a restricted military zone , a charge which carries a maximum 20-year jail sentence in greece .
the charges were increased to full-blown espionage after , the greek authorities allege , notebooks were seized containing details of other airfields .
the offence is often treated harshly in greece because of longstanding military tensions with turkey .
british diplomats had expected the court would view the whole affair as arising out of a misunderstanding about what the hobby of plane-spotting involves .
the 11 men in the group were transferred on friday from police holding cells in kalamata , south-east greece , to a prison in nafplion , which is about 80 miles from athens .
the sole woman , grandmother leslie coppin , 51 , was separated from the men , including her husband paul coppin , and taken to korydalos women 's prison in a suburb of athens .
others detained include antoni adamiak , 36 , from london ; peter norris , 52 , of uxbridge , west london ; wayne groves , 38 , of tamworth ; andrew jenkins , 32 , from york ; mick keane and steve rush .
two dutch men are also being questioned .
