in an attempt to ease the situation , pakistan president pervez musharraf says he is ready to meet indian prime minister atal behari vajpayee - but delhi has rejected the offer .
" until pakistan is able to create a conducive climate by acting resolutely and meaningfully against terrorism , the outlook for such dialogue can not be promising , " a senior foreign ministry official told reuters news agency .
talks at a lower level , however , are not being completely ruled out .
us president george w bush , meanwhile , said his administration is " working actively to bring some calm in the region to hopefully convince both sides to stop the escalation of force " .
tension mounts the military build-up is the neighbours ' biggest for almost 15 years .
in the northern indian city of agra , officials said they were planning to camouflage the taj mahal , the famous 17th century marble monument to love , in case of pakistani air attack .
a tourism official told associated press that tailors were stitching together more than 400 metres of cloth to cover the mausoleum 's dome and its minarets .
tensions between the nuclear rivals have been mounting since a suicide attack on the indian parliament two weeks ago , which delhi alleges was backed by the pakistani intelligence service .
on friday , two indian civilians were killed and five wounded when pakistani troops opened fire on the border in kashmir , an indian defence official said .
if confirmed , they would be the latest civilian casualties in border clashes which have occurred daily over the past two weeks .
at least 12 indian soldiers were killed as they laid landmines on the border in the desert state of rajasthan on friday .
talks offer general musharraf said he would be prepared to hold talks with the indian prime minister at a regional summit in nepal next week .
but he warned that both sides had to be looking for a way out of the dispute .

pakistani security officials earlier told the bbc they believe that 95 % of the indian air force is now in an offensive position - in addition to the existing heavy deployment of troops along the border .
pakistani officials say the indian deployment is even bigger than that witnessed during a brief conflict with militants in the kargil sector of the disputed territory of kashmir two years ago .
pakistan 's military spokesman , general rashid qureshi , said the nature of the indian deployment suggested a desire for offensive action , and that india would find it difficult to back down .

the two countries have announced a number of sanctions against each other .
in delhi , there were emotional scenes at the bus station as the last bus left india for pakistan before direct services between the two countries were cut .
despite the measures , india says it will allow president musharraf to fly through indian airspace to attend the nepal summit .
the indian sanctions were aimed at forcing pakistan to take action against two kashmir militant groups , lashkar-e-toiba and jaish-e-mohammad , which india blamed for a suicide attack on its parliament two weeks ago .
asked whether he was prepared to move against the two groups , mr musharraf said : " we understand our responsibility .
we know what we have to do . "
pakistan has already frozen the groups ' assets and arrested the founder of the jaish group , but delhi is demanding that they be shut down for good .
india 's foreign minister jaswant singh has described the pakistani actions as " cosmetic measures and non-measures " .

bbc news -pipe- arts -pipe- young stars sing opera 's praises categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : entertainment : arts front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 29 december , 2001 , 08:55 gmt young stars sing opera 's praises jeffers and boe are two of the roh 's first young vilars by bbc news online 's rebecca thomas singers alfred boe and gweneth-ann jeffers are young and trendy and might not look out of place in the world of pop .
but they are among six new young faces of classical music at the royal opera house -lrb- roh -rrb- in covent garden , central london .
as such , they are one of the most visible signs that opera is making great strides to shake off its traditional stuffy image .
boe , 28 , and jeffers , 31 , are two of what the roh calls its young vilars - a group of promising singers offered two-year intensive training places for the first time this year .
they will partake in workshops and coaching that will teach them all the skills they need to perform in opera of the highest standard .
i saw my first opera at the roh when i was three years old and told my mother i wanted to be an opera singer gweneth-ann jeffers " we had three hours of rapier and dagger training this morning , " enthuses jeffers .
" it 's really interesting and teaches us about balance and strengthening our muscles so that we can sing in every position . "
an important part of the vilars ' training also includes visiting local schools to introduce classical music to the next generation .
in this respect , both boe and jeffers acknowledge that they are ambassadors for a new age of opera .
both also agree that their work with children is vital to changing attitudes .
" i look back now and realise just how influenced i was by classical music as a child , " says boe .
" my father would play classical records and although i did n't know it , it was all soaking in .
such appreciation has to be nurtured from an early age . "
' stereotype ' jeffers asserts that the musty , elitist perception of opera has long been outdated .
" opera performance has changed dramatically .
the stereotype of a fat lady singing on stage and not moving has long gone , " she says .
" singers and directors are getting younger and they bring new ideas for productions with lots of movement and dancing which is of interest to a younger audience . "
jeffers - an experienced soprano recitalist who represented england in 2001 's cardiff singer of the world contest - is proof that opera can appeal to the very young .
the roh : a focal point of the vilars ' ambition she explains : " i saw my first opera at the roh when i was three years old and told my mother i wanted to be an opera singer and give my first operatic address at covent garden . "
boe - a tenor who has represented the uk in major european competitions - confirms that in coming to the roh he also fulfilled a personal dream , although it was incredibly daunting .
" just walking into this impressive building really gets you .
it affects your nerves and makes you tense , " he says .
" but nerves are just a case of wanting to do well because this is the major opera house of the uk . "
jitters boe and jeffers will tackle their first case of major nerves when they each make their performance debut for the roh next year .
jeffers will take the part of ines in il trovatore conducted by carlo rizzi .
and in may , she will sing in the concert performances of daphne conducted by christian thieleman .
boe will sing the shepherd in tristan und isolde conducted by bernard haitink , also in april .
boe admits that he expects to be jittery when the time comes to get on stage but he also hopes to take it in his stride .
" it 's part of the learning process to be able to take everything as it comes and handle the pressure , " he says .
" luckily , everyone is behind us and here to help us achieve - so hopefully we will come out having done a very good job . "

the other had been blown off while bomb making in the kosovo war .
this was march in a still snowy albanian village in northern macedonia and the commander was preparing for a war in the only corner of the former yugoslavia untouched by the past decade 's ethnic conflict .
today this commander is biding his time in his villa on the albanian coast after war was averted by a skilful and unprecedented international diplomatic intervention to save macedonia .
but the macedonian time bomb was not defused altogether .
the republic of two million people remains at risk of an explosion of ethnic violence if the peace deal achieved under international pressure is not implemented fully .
the first sign of trouble came last january with a mortar attack on a police station in the small town of tearce , in western macedonia .
a statement was issued by a previously unheard of albanian guerrilla group , the national liberation army .
it said : " the uniform of the macedonian occupier will be targeted until all areas with albanian population are liberated " .
macedonia is a tiny chunk of what was once yugoslavia , landlocked between albania , kosovo , serbia , bulgaria and greece .
between a quarter and a third of the population are ethnic albanian , and they have always had a seat in government .
resentment " this is not kosovo , " a member of the majority slav population told me a year ago , summarising ethnic macedonian resentment both at the albanians taking up arms and at an international community which , it was angrily claimed , had misunderstood the situation in the republic .
but ethnic albanians felt they were second class citizens , virtually excluded from the police and army , denied state funding for their university in tetovo and subject to a constitution which described the country as being the " national state of the macedonian people " .
so although the nla gunmen were always a minority within a minority , western diplomats were taken by surprise at the level of support the guerrillas quickly achieved among an albanian population who believed their aspirations had been too-long denied .
a world away from the mountain villages where the nla was born , even the news reader on macedonian state television 's albanian language program could proclaim : " they are heroes .
if i was not a mother with two children i would join them too " .
once the fighting erupted around the western city of tetovo , it proved difficult to stop .
albanian guerrillas there denounced the nla 's own general staff as cowards for wanting to accept the first of many internationally brokered cease-fires .
the macedonian security forces brought out helicopter gun-ships and heavy artillery , pounding rebel-held villages in defiance of international calls for restraint .
the 3,000-strong german nato garrison stationed nearby ran for cover - there would be no immediate military intervention .
diplomacy instead there was a text-book exercise in preventative diplomacy by nato , the eu and the us .
over seven gruelling weeks of intensive negotiations in the picturesque setting of a villa on lake ohrid , american and european envoys brought the two sides progressively closer together .
events on the battlefield threatened to derail the whole process several times .
the rebels took the village of aracinovo , and threatened to rain down mortar bombs on the capital , skopje , if the security forces did not stop their punishing assault .
eventually nla rebels were escorted out of aracinovo by international troops .
this event and the emerging terms of the peace deal provoked an armed crowd of ethnic macedonians to go on the rampage , attacking western embassies , international journalists and even the macedonian parliament .
the deal which had so enraged them allows for an extra 1,000 albanian police officers to be recruited .
but they will remain under control of the central government in skopje and not be answerable to local leaders , as the ethnic albanians had wanted .
albanian will become an official language along with macedonian and can be used in official institutions in areas where ethnic albanians account for at least 20 % of the population .

jane 's defence weekly says that in reality the albanians may continue to hold up to 8,000 guns .
a respected think tank , the international crisis group , says that some 3,000 guns are also in the hands of ethnic macedonian paramilitaries .
after much delay , the macedonian government has finally approved the constitutional changes set out in the peace deal .
but the ethnic albanians say it is a watered down version of what was agreed .
and elections due to be held in january to cement the peace deal now look like being delayed .
among the ethnic macedonian parties in the coalition government , the moderate social democrats have now pulled out of the government , leaving it in the hands of uncompromising nationalists .
most of the nla 's leadership have put on suits and have entered the political arena .
but some important commanders have joined a new group , the albanian national army .
it wants to unify all albanian lands - so-called greater albania - something which will be resisted to the last drop of blood by the ethnic macedonians .
the peace deal is at risk of being torn apart by two opposing forces : the macedonian nationalists bitterly resentful that the international community forced them to give away too much , and albanian rebels who think they can still get more .

the other had been blown off while bomb making in the kosovo war .
this was march in a still snowy albanian village in northern macedonia and the commander was preparing for a war in the only corner of the former yugoslavia untouched by the past decade 's ethnic conflict .
today this commander is biding his time in his villa on the albanian coast after war was averted by a skilful and unprecedented international diplomatic intervention to save macedonia .
but the macedonian time bomb was not defused altogether .
the republic of two million people remains at risk of an explosion of ethnic violence if the peace deal achieved under international pressure is not implemented fully .
the first sign of trouble came last january with a mortar attack on a police station in the small town of tearce , in western macedonia .
a statement was issued by a previously unheard of albanian guerrilla group , the national liberation army .
it said : " the uniform of the macedonian occupier will be targeted until all areas with albanian population are liberated " .
macedonia is a tiny chunk of what was once yugoslavia , landlocked between albania , kosovo , serbia , bulgaria and greece .
between a quarter and a third of the population are ethnic albanian , and they have always had a seat in government .
resentment " this is not kosovo , " a member of the majority slav population told me a year ago , summarising ethnic macedonian resentment both at the albanians taking up arms and at an international community which , it was angrily claimed , had misunderstood the situation in the republic .
but ethnic albanians felt they were second class citizens , virtually excluded from the police and army , denied state funding for their university in tetovo and subject to a constitution which described the country as being the " national state of the macedonian people " .
nla rebels achieved a high level of support so although the nla gunmen were always a minority within a minority , western diplomats were taken by surprise at the level of support the guerrillas quickly achieved among an albanian population who believed their aspirations had been too-long denied .
a world away from the mountain villages where the nla was born , even the news reader on macedonian state television 's albanian language program could proclaim : " they are heroes .
if i was not a mother with two children i would join them too " .
once the fighting erupted around the western city of tetovo , it proved difficult to stop .

urgently needed repairs to the forth rail bridge could be undermined by the uncertain future of railtrack and possible delays in world heritage listing , linlithgow mp tam dalyell has warned .
the mp , a tireless campaigner for bridge maintenance , is to write to transport minister stephen byers to ask what arrangements are being made to keep the bridge in good order .
the government has previously said the maintenance of the bridge is a commercial matter for railtrack .
however , with the company going into administration , mr dalyell wants to know how long it will be before a full repair schedule is resumed on the bridge which links edinburgh to fife and the north east of scotland .
mr dalyell , who has previously raised the problem in the westminster parliament , said he had seen for himself the deterioration of the structure .
he said : " i have been given a tour of the bridge and the problem is , that dirt that gets into nooks and crannies , creating decay . "
" in addition , little holes have been drilled in the structure , for the lights illuminating it , and that is where rust starts . "
the mp fears that delays caused by the railtrack hiatus , will lead to further rusting and make future repairs more costly .
world heritage site railtrack said it was designing a maintenance plan for the bridge , with contractors balfour beattie .
but bridge preservation campaigners will be looking to ensure that the organisation which takes over from railtrack , will actually implement that plan .
meanwhile , it seems that a hoped for boost for the preservation of the bridge may be too far in the future , to put pressure on the government to act .
the structure is waiting in the wings , on a list of sites to be granted world heritage status .
however , the recent designation of new lanark as a world heritage site , may be the last for some time to come , north of the border .
the bridge was placed on unesco 's ' tentative ' list , by the british government , in 1999 alongside new lanark and 23 other uk locations but unesco -lrb- united nations educational , scientific and cultural organisation -rrb- has decided to limit the number of sites any country can nominate , to one a year from 2002 , so the bridge may have to wait a while .
built in the 1880 's by benjamin baker , the structure has long been regarded as one of the engineering wonders of the world .
engineering feat the revolutionary cantilever design at first shocked the victorians , still nervous after the tay bridge collapse .
but eventually the bridge came to be a source of national pride .
at the height of construction 4,500 workers from a dozen countries worked to build it .
it was the first cantilever bridge and the first large steel bridge .
the selection of the bridge for tentative inclusion as a world heritage site marks a shift away from cathedrals and medieval cities , towards natural and industrial sites , by the unesco heritage panel .
