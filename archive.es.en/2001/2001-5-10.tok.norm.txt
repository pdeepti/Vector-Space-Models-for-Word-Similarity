it is aimed at persuading the us congress to hold hearings on the existence of unidentified flying objects and extra-terrestrials . the campaign believes the us government has known about the existence of ufos for over 50 years but has been trying to hide it . ' alien life forms ' it was surely the strangest ever news conference hosted by washington 's august national press club .
donna hare was just one of over 20 witnesses , most of them ex-military , and all deadly serious . i was involved in situations where we actually did recoveries of crashed saucers. former army sergeant clifford stone among them was former army sergeant , clifford stone , who said the us government had tried to suppress what he had seen one strange day in pennsylvania , back in 1969 .
" i was involved in situations where we actually did recoveries of crashed saucers .
there were bodies that were involved with some of these crashes .
also some of these were alive , " he said .
" while we were doing this , we were telling the american public there was nothing to it .
we were telling the world there was nothing to it , " mr stone added .
so what , we all wondered , did they look like ?
were these visitors from another world the antennaed , hideous , slime-trailing creatures of science fiction ?
" you have individuals that look very much like you and myself , that could walk among us and you would n't even notice the difference , " he said .
he claimed to have catalogued 57 different species of alien life forms .
aliens for peace the brains behind project disclosure is country doctor turned ambassador to outer space steven greer .
he says there are two reasons for the project : first , to persuade the us government to reveal the astonishing planet-saving technology he says it has picked up from super-clever aliens , and second , to stop the bush administration from annoying them by building weapons in space .
" we 're not alone .
there are life forms out there , which while they are not hostile , have clearly shown that they 're not pleased with our tendency to put weapons in space , " mr greer said .
but does n't he think it will be tricky to walk into the white house and say to george w bush : " do n't go ahead with missile defence .
aliens do n't like it " ?
" i do n't think it 's tricky at all .
i think those discussions have happened in covert circles .
i think the decision has been made to weaponise space anyway , " mr greer added .
true believers for the apparently very pro-alien audience , it was a news conference from heaven . if you got bombarded and shot down from the sky and mistreated , how would you behave ?
project instigator steven greer one member of the audience said he believed people like mr greer much more than he believed the government .
" i know that major operators within the us government are big liars , " he said .
and when asked why extra-terrestrials had not come down and talked to the people of the world themselves , he asked , " if you got bombarded and shot down from the sky and mistreated , how would you behave ? "
the press conference just confirmed the beliefs of another audience member , who said she had seen ufos many times .
how would she respond to people who think that folks who believe in ufos are crazy ?
" they have n't seen them , and it 's hard to believe anything unless you 've experienced it , " she said .
and that really is the problem in a nutshell .
despite the impressive military credentials and undoubted sincerity of the witnesses , congress is surely unlikely to move on their request for a hearing - unless a space ship lands on , or at least within sight of , capitol hill .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- uk rate cut on the cards low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's economic reporter darshini david " businesses are being hit by slowing global demand " real 56k thursday , 10 may , 2001 , 04:23 gmt 05:23 uk uk rate cut on the cards the bank of england : under pressure to cut interest rates the bank of england is expected to announce a cut in interest rates at midday on thursday at the end of its monthly two-day meeting .
much of the domestic economy is thriving , but worries about the impact of a global slowdown could mean that the cost of borrowing falls for the third time this year .
a surprise us rate cut last month - the fourth this year - increased pressure on the bank 's monetary policy committee to follow suit , in an effort to stave off a recession .
a half a percent cut would probably be an over-reaction , 0.25 % would be sensible cbi associate director sudhir junankar a raft of gloomy economic news from around the world suggests that britain will find it difficult to avoid the effects of a global economic downturn .
figures released on tuesday by the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- show business confidence is continuing to fall sharply across the uk , adding to pressure for a cut .
' modestly optimistic ' the bank of england has cut interest rates twice in 2001 , bringing the cost of borrowing down for homeowners and businesses from 6 % at the start of the year to 5.5 % , the lowest level in more than 30 years .
it reduced rates by 0.25 % in april , in reaction to a slowdown in the economy and the impact of the foot-and-mouth crisis .
bank of england governor sir edward george has said he would be willing to cut rates further if there was evidence of a continuing slowdown .
inflation remains below the government 's 2.5 % target , leaving room for further cuts .
we can look forward to a pick-up in us activity as we move , say , into next year sir edward george however , sir edward said this week he was " modestly optimistic " about the prospect of a us recovery , given the federal reserve 's interest rate cuts .
addressing the swiss institute of international studies in zurich earlier this week , sir edward said us figures had not on the whole been as weak as many commentators predicted .
on an optimistic view , therefore , " we can look forward to a pick-up in us activity as we move , say , into next year " , he said .
at its most recent monthly meeting , the nine-strong mpc voted in favour of a 0.25 % cut , to 5.5 % .
three members of the committee were in favour of an even deeper cut of half a percentage point , the committee 's minutes showed when they were published two weeks later .
sir edward has the casting vote if there is no majority .
gloomy indicators the cbi regional trends survey showed business confidence at its lowest level since january 1999 with the sharpest drop coming in the south-east , adding to the list of gloomy economic indicators that the mpc will have to consider .
the chartered institute of purchasers and suppliers said last week its purchasing managers indices for both the manufacturing and the services sectors were contracting to levels below economists ' expectations .
cbi associate director sudhir junankar said : " with inflation prospects good , this gloomy picture across most regions suggests there is nothing to stop a quarter point cut in interest rates this week . "
the cbi 's export optimism survey also showed a marked decline , with weakening growth prospects and an ailing euro failing to sustain the optimism of the last survey .
investment intentions were negative in all but two regions , the east midlands and northern ireland .
" with confidence falling and manufacturers ' margins under further pressure , plant and machinery investment intentions are not surprisingly negative in nearly all regions , " mr junankar added .
job losses the manufacturing sector has been hit by job losses and this is expected to continue as profit margins remain under pressure .
across britain , expectations of job cuts in manufacturing are at their gloomiest since mid-1999 .
some 17,000 manufacturing jobs will be shed in the second quarter of 2001 , the survey estimated .
mr junankar said the survey showed britain was heading for a slowdown rather than a full-blown recession .
commenting on the likelihood of a further cut in interest rates , he said : " a half a percent cut would probably be an over-reaction , 0.25 % would be sensible . "

a half a percent cut would probably be an over-reaction , 0.25 % would be sensible cbi associate director sudhir junankar a raft of gloomy economic news from around the world suggests that britain will find it difficult to avoid the effects of a global economic downturn .
figures released on tuesday by the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- show business confidence is continuing to fall sharply across the uk , adding to pressure for a cut .
' modestly optimistic ' the bank of england has cut interest rates twice in 2001 , bringing the cost of borrowing down for homeowners and businesses from 6 % at the start of the year to 5.5 % , the lowest level in more than 30 years .
it reduced rates by 0.25 % in april , in reaction to a slowdown in the economy and the impact of the foot-and-mouth crisis .
bank of england governor sir edward george has said he would be willing to cut rates further if there was evidence of a continuing slowdown .
inflation remains below the government 's 2.5 % target , leaving room for further cuts .
we can look forward to a pick-up in us activity as we move , say , into next year sir edward george however , sir edward said this week he was " modestly optimistic " about the prospect of a us recovery , given the federal reserve 's interest rate cuts .
addressing the swiss institute of international studies in zurich earlier this week , sir edward said us figures had not on the whole been as weak as many commentators predicted .
on an optimistic view , therefore , " we can look forward to a pick-up in us activity as we move , say , into next year " , he said .
at its most recent monthly meeting , the nine-strong mpc voted in favour of a 0.25 % cut , to 5.5 % .
three members of the committee were in favour of an even deeper cut of half a percentage point , the committee 's minutes showed when they were published two weeks later .
sir edward has the casting vote if there is no majority .
gloomy indicators the cbi regional trends survey showed business confidence at its lowest level since january 1999 with the sharpest drop coming in the south-east , adding to the list of gloomy economic indicators that the mpc will have to consider .
the chartered institute of purchasers and suppliers said last week its purchasing managers indices for both the manufacturing and the services sectors were contracting to levels below economists ' expectations .
cbi associate director sudhir junankar said : " with inflation prospects good , this gloomy picture across most regions suggests there is nothing to stop a quarter point cut in interest rates this week . "
the cbi 's export optimism survey also showed a marked decline , with weakening growth prospects and an ailing euro failing to sustain the optimism of the last survey .
investment intentions were negative in all but two regions , the east midlands and northern ireland .
" with confidence falling and manufacturers ' margins under further pressure , plant and machinery investment intentions are not surprisingly negative in nearly all regions , " mr junankar added .
job losses the manufacturing sector has been hit by job losses and this is expected to continue as profit margins remain under pressure .
across britain , expectations of job cuts in manufacturing are at their gloomiest since mid-1999 .
some 17,000 manufacturing jobs will be shed in the second quarter of 2001 , the survey estimated .
mr junankar said the survey showed britain was heading for a slowdown rather than a full-blown recession .
commenting on the likelihood of a further cut in interest rates , he said : " a half a percent cut would probably be an over-reaction , 0.25 % would be sensible . "

the researchers made their remarks after observing a dramatic decline in the population of one bird colony , which coincided with an abnormal warm period in the southern ocean in the 1970s .
the penguin numbers at dumont d 'urville station in terre adelie were found to have dropped abruptly by 50 % when the average winter temperatures in the area rose from minus 17.3c to minus 14.7c.
however , british researchers cautioned against jumping to conclusions about any global warming and insisted that overall penguin numbers in the antarctic were healthy .
egg hatching the temperature increase at terre adelie , which lasted into the early 1980s , raised sea-surface temperatures and reduced the extent of local sea ice .
reduced sea ice is associated with a lower abundance of krill , the small shrimps that are a key element of a penguin 's diet along with fish and squid .
christophe barbraud and henri wirmerskirch , from the centre d 'etudes biologiques de chize , in villiers en bois , wrote of their findings in the journal nature : " in years with high ssts -lrb- sea surface temperatures -rrb- emperor penguins probably have difficulties in finding food , which could increase mortality . "
paradoxically , extensive winter pack ice reduced egg-hatching success by increasing the distance between the hatching areas and the hunting grounds , the scientists found .
this meant , the researchers said , the penguin population faced a trade-off between finding enough food to survive and laying enough eggs to sustain the colony .
computer models the researchers report that penguin numbers at terre adelie have now stabilised .
however , they write in nature : " our results ... indicate that emperor penguins may be very susceptible to environmental variability . "
commenting on the work , british researchers said the terre adelie experience might not have wider implications - particularly with respect to any global warming process that could be taking place .
" the climate models give no clear indication of whether a global warming would mean more or less sea ice in future and how this might affect penguins , " keith reid , of the biosciences division at the british antarctic survey , told the bbc " at the moment , there are no indications that the penguin is in trouble . "
he added : " it looks like this could be a very localised effect just in this colony .
a glacier in that area used to give protection to the colony but the front of it fell off in the 1970s and there were predictions then that the penguin population might go into decline .
it 's what you 'd expected if it 's less sheltered there . "
