today 's events without a doubt have serious implications for the peace process president andres pastrana president pastrana said he would visit the stronghold of the leftist revolutionary armed forces of colombia , or farc , after a candidate in next year 's presidential elections was prevented from entering the area .
the farc controls territory about the size of switzerland , which was ceded to them in 1998 in an attempt to launch peace talks .
the government has until 8 october to decide whether to allow the farc to remain in control of the area .
mr pastrana began talks with the farc in 1999 , but there has been little progress in the past two years .
he did not explain why he had decided not to travel to the farc-controlled area .
convoy halted horacio serpa , the liberal party candidate , was blocked by the farc at balsillas , 200km -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- south of the capital bogota .
he had driven there with thousands of his supporters in a 112-bus convoy to try and step up the pressure on the farc to make concessions and halt alleged human rights abuses in the area they control .
" it 's not horacio serpa who has lost , " the candidate , who has been leading polls ahead of presidential elections scheduled for may , told reporters .
" what has lost is democracy . "
before the procession set out , the 16,000-strong farc announced that it had blocked a road along the route due to fighting with troops in the area .
an army spokesman in bogota confirmed that there had been clashes in that area on saturday .
and farc warned that it could not guarantee mr serpa 's safety if the caravan proceeded .
' campaign tactic ' rebel chief manuel marulanda has accused mr serpa trying to gain votes by taking a tough stance against the guerrillas .
after metal spikes were put on the road , causing flat tyres in some of the convoy 's vehicles , mr serpa and his supporters had no choice but to proceed to the southern city of neiva , to spend the night .
the 37-year-old civil war waged by the farc and a smaller leftist rebel army against the government and a rival right-wing paramilitary army has claimed at least 3,000 lives every year .
mr serpa is currently leading the polls ahead of next may 's vote .
his liberal party is a traditional opponent of mr pastrana 's conservatives , although mr serpa had consistently backed the president 's peace negotiations with the guerrillas .
however independent presidential candidate alvaro uribe has been gaining support with his call for a crackdown on the rebels .
mr serpa has now started to toughen his own position on the farc .
both candidates in have made political capital from attacking the president 's conciliatory approach .
mr pastrana is barred by the constitution from standing for reelection .

the deaths have pushed the fatality count up to more than 130 since the start of the election campaign .
the authorities have mounted one of the heaviest security operations in the 30-year history of the country in advance of monday 's poll .
more than 55,000 security personnel have been deployed to prevent violence .
there is much at stake for the two main parties - the governing awami league , which was at the forefront of the country 's war of independence , and the bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- , which was created by forces opposed to the awami league in the late 1970s .
the vote comes at the end of the longest stretch of uninterrupted democracy that the country has experienced , and both parties have pulled out all the stops in their quest to win power .
bangladesh independence in 1971 seven general elections 300 parliamentary seats 75 million voters the awami league wants to be the first party ever to be democratically re-elected , while the bnp is seeking to re-occupy the position in government it held from 1991 to 1996 .
the mutual animosity between the leaders of the awami league and the bnp , sheikh hasina and khaleda zia , is reflected among their supporters who have frequently clashed .
the outcome of the election in this polarised country could be close .
bnp 's alliance in the 1991 and 1996 elections , the awami league secured more votes than their rivals .
although the bnp won 40 more parliamentary seats in 1991 , it failed to repeat the performance four years later , losing 30 seats to the awami league .
this time , the bnp is leading a three-party electoral alliance with two islamic groups that command the support of about 10 % of voters .
if the year-old alliance works well , it could represent a serious threat to the awami league .
the awami league has been warning that bangladesh will lose its secular bengali identity if the bnp and its hardline allies are elected .
there was evidence of militant islam in the campaign .
in some areas of dhaka , pictures of osama bin laden could be seen alongside photographs of parliamentary candidates .
but the opposition alliance vehemently denies that it supports any form of militancy and has accused the awami league of using gunmen to intimidate political rivals .
third party the chances for the revival of a third party do not appear good , but may be crucial to the formation of the next government if the main contenders fail to win a clear majority .
the jatiya party led by former ruler general ershad held more than 30 seats in the two previous parliaments , but has been riven by splits and defections .
general ershad has himself been disqualified from contesting the election because of a conviction for corruption .
but the huge popularity he commands in his home district in the northern bangladesh may help his party maintain its third position .
elections are being held in 299 seats of the 300-seat parliament .
polling in one constituency was postponed because of the death of a candidate .
the top nine leaders of the awami league and the bnp are contesting 30 constituencies as the electoral law allows a person to contest up to five seats .
but since a candidate can only hold one seat , there could be a number of seats left vacant after the votes are counted , and it is expected that whichever party secures at least 141 seats will form the next government .
