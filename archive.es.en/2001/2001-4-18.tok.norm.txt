bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- peru military chiefs exit amid scandal low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : americas front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 18 april , 2001 , 06:05 gmt 07:05 uk peru military chiefs exit amid scandal alberto fujimori left power in disgrace peru 's interim president , valentin paniagua , has accepted the resignations of the country 's military chiefs , after they were exposed backing the disgraced former president alberto fujimori .
wanting to avoid adding a new unsettling factor into the electoral process , we have decided to accept their resignations valentin paniagua the army , navy and air force chiefs - carlos tafur , victor ramos and pablo carbone - offered to resign on monday , after the release of videos showing them signing documents endorsing mr fujimori 's attempt to seize dictatorial powers in 1992 .
the military commanders said they were forced to sign the document by mr fujimori 's fugitive spy chief vladimiro montesinos , who used blackmail in running the armed forces .
mr paniagua said the three men would be replaced soon mr paniagua said the three men would be replaced by officers who were not involved in the scandal , but he did not name them .
he did not mention police chief armando santisteban , who also tendered his resignation on monday .
" wanting to avoid adding a new unsettling factor into the electoral process , we have decided to accept their resignations , " he said in a televised address to the nation .
government support the resigning commanders were appointed last november as part of a purge of high-ranking officials in the military .
the previous military leadership was viewed as remaining loyal to mr fujimori and mr montesinos .
montesinos built up an all-consuming web of corruption the peruvian congress has recently been releasing videos taken in march 1999 , showing hundreds of officers signing pledges endorsing mr fujimori 's 1992 so-called " auto-coup " .
in the coup , the former president deployed troops to dissolve the opposition-controlled congress and temporarily close the courts .
president paniagua 's government earlier this month expressed support for the current police and military high command , arguing they were forced to sign the endorsements of mr fujimori by their superiors at the time .
on the run there have been calls in peru for all officers who backed mr fujimori to go .
analysts say mr montesinos drew hundreds of officers and officials into a web of corruption , either through promotions or other favours .
they say that a purge of all officers tainted by corruption would cripple the peruvian military completely .
mr fujimori 's 10-year rule ended in november last year after he fled to japan , amid mounting corruption scandals surrounding mr montesinos .
the former intelligence services chief is still on the run .
he faces charges of drug-trafficking , arms smuggling , bribery and corruption .
