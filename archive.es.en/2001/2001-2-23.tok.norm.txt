judge octavio augusto machado de barros said members of the gang , known as the first commando of the capital -lrb- pcc -rrb- would end the violence in return for a transfer of some prisoners .
but the authorities in the state of sao paulo , where most of the riots have happened , have refused to negotiate with inmates .
on thursday , there was another riot at a sao paulo prison , only days after the massive revolt at 29 jails left 19 inmates dead .
more than 250 inmates at the prison of sao jose do rio preto about 400 km west of the city of sao paulo , took a guard hostage and threatened to set the jail on fire before police restored order .
the prison 's capacity is 230 inmates , but it actually has 410 inmates .
like many brazilian jails it is crammed with nearly twice the number of men .
sao paulo 's state government has tightened security prisons this week .
no visits the head of the prison administration , nagashi furukawa , said visits would not be allowed at jails that were damaged by rioting .
as news of the ban on visits spread , prison authorities were bombarded by letters from inmates across the state , media reports said on thursday .
the weekend uprising was orchestrated from carandiru , latin america 's largest jail , and was the biggest of its kind in brazil .
the mounting unrest has sparked renewed calls for prison reform .
extra funding one of the brazilian prison guards ' unions , the state correction workers union , has warned that prisoners are preparing more uprisings on a still bigger scale .
brazilian president fernando henrique cardoso has promised to increase federal funding from $ 4.5m last year to $ 33m this year .
but despite his promises of more money to build new prisons , many observers doubt whether the extra funding will solve the two main problems of overcrowding and corruption .
there are presently about 200,000 inmates in a system built to hold fewer than half that number .

the zimbabwean defence minister , stanislaus mudenge , whose country backs the congolese government , said the un resolution was an important first step .
at the end of a three-day meeting on the drc , the united nations security council set a new timetable for the pull back of the different factions .
of course it 's only the beginning of a long journey , but it 's a good beginning french un ambassador jean-david levitte representatives from the six warring countries and the three main rebel groups were all present at the discussions .
efforts to end the two-and-a-half year conflict have come to a head recently following the death of former dr congo president laurent kabila .
agreement in a resolution negotiated with all the parties , the council has demanded that the forces start an initial 15km -lrb- 10 mile -rrb- pull-back by 15 march .
they should then plan for a complete withdrawal by 15 may .
" of course it 's only the beginning of a long journey , but it 's a good beginning , " said french ambassador jean-david levitte .
the un has plans to deploy 3,000 troops in dr congo to monitor the withdrawals .
the namibian president , sam nujoma , speaking after talks with president joseph kabila in kinshasa , said : " we want to give the congolese people the opportunity to free themselves and to commence the expected democratisation process so as to freely choose their leaders . "
pull back there are about 50,000 foreign troops from african countries in dr congo .
rwanda and uganda , which support the rebels , have already announced plans to pull back some of their troops .
rwanda said it would unilaterally pull all its troops back 200km from current positions , starting at midnight on 28 february as a goodwill gesture which it hoped the congolese government would imitate .
uganda said on tuesday it would withdraw 1,000 of its forces from congo .
cautious optimism has grown since last month 's assassination of congo president laurent kabila .
but even if foreign forces do withdraw from the country , it will be an enormous task to fashion a functioning government with any real control of the congo 's vast territory .
fighting over its rich natural resources has brought it to the brink of disintegration .

the educational institute of scotland -lrb- eis -rrb- says the mccrone agreement will only work if teachers are given the right to exclude repeatedly disruptive children .
reported assaults on teachers nearly doubled last year to more than 3,000 and teachers believe many more cases of unruly pupils went unreported .
the mccrone agreement in february saw scotland 's two largest teaching unions vote to accept a 21.5 % pay rise .
however the success of the pay negotiations has been tempered by unruly elements in the classroom .
eis : wants to exclude troublesome pupils the teaching union wants to target those persistent offenders who disrupt the classroom and make teaching more difficult .
the scottish executive is committed to a policy of inclusion in schools and has set up a discipline task group .
however at a meeting of teachers in paisley on thursday , vice-president of the eis , sandy fowler , called for teachers to be able to exclude repeatedly disruptive children .
confidence building measure he said the kind of improvement envisioned for schools would only happen if teachers could work in a safe and disciplined environment .
" people 's confidence in the new culture will be affected particularly by how the ministerial task force on indiscipline deals with the problem .
" it has to have teeth and it has to have an unambiguous proposal in it that teachers can exclude pupils who cause major disciplinary problems . "
teaching unions had fought hard for a pay settlement which met with the approval of the majority of their members .
discipline the three-year agreement was clinched earlier this month with over three-quarters of the teaching members voting for the deal .
at the time , education minister jack mcconnell said the agreement represented a " turning point " in scottish education .
