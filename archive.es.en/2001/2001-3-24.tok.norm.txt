the leaders - ibrahim rugova , hashim thaci and ramush haradjinaj - simultaneously called on macedonia to show restraint and to address the grievances of ethnic albanians living there .
the statements backing the government came as the nato-led peacekeeping force in kosovo , k-for , reported that a number of civilians were injured by shrapnel after the macedonian army attacked rebels in the hills above the northern town of tetovo .
tensions are running high around tetovo , where the albanian community buried a father and son gunned down by macedonian security forces who said they had acted to prevent a grenade attack .

similar statements have already been issued by moderate macedonian albanians and by the albanian government in tirana , as part of intensive european efforts to isolate the rebels .
macedonia has repeatedly alleged that the guerrillas are getting supplies and support from kosovo , and demanded that nato step up border patrols in the serbian province .
nato has now agreed to boost its presence on macedonia 's border with kosovo , while the united states has ordered spy planes to be deployed in the area to monitor the movement of the rebels .
the guerrillas have threatened to escalate the conflict if the macedonian authorities reject their offer of a truce and talks .
the united nations refugee agency , the unhcr , says an estimated 22,000 people have left their homes in macedonia since fighting broke out last week .

brigadier alex birtwistle , who is in charge of the army unit assisting the operation , said sites had been identified around the county for the mass slaughter .
up to 300,000 live animals and thousands more carcasses are expected to be transported from farms in " cull zones " to the sites , which are most likely to be set up on disused airfields , he said .
this is a disease that has devastated this community and we must get on and sort it out brigadier alex birtwistle the spread of the disease is continuing to escalate , with 514 cases now confirmed in the uk .
currently 80 army personnel are assigned to the task of organising the operation in cumbria , which will draw on the skills of local farmers , contractors and slaughtermen .
they will not get involved in the actual killing of the animals , which will be done by licensed slaughtermen .
brigadier birtwistle , of 42 north-west brigade , told channel 4 news : " because of the scale of the problem , what we are contingency-planning for now is to establish a series of sites to which we will take the live animals and they will be slaughtered and disposed of there .
experimenting " this will allow us to deal with them more quickly .
" we have established three airfields for which we have got environmental clearance , but there are other factors we still have to look at .
we are going for as many sites as we can . "
specially-adapted vehicles are to be used to ensure that foot-and-mouth is not spread during the journeys from farm to slaughter site .
an agricultural expert checks lambs for signs of the disease he said : " they will move within the infected areas .
those that are infected will go in spill-free vehicles and we are experimenting ... on creating more vehicles quickly by the use of polythene and liners that will keep the area safe . "
the use of landfill sites to bury the animals in mass graves is being considered as a speedier alternative to incineration , but sensitive environmental considerations have to be taken into account , he said .
where possible , local contractors will be used to carry out necessary work , in order to pump money back into the community .
local farmers and national farmers ' union officials were assisting in drawing up the plans , he added .
" what we have got to do now is look forward and see what we can do for the future to bring prosperity back here , " said brigadier birtwistle .
" this is a disease that has devastated this community and we must get on and sort it out . "
the army took an active role in helping contain the 1967 outbreak of foot-and-mouth .
tory leader william hague has called for soldiers to be used in a " much more whole-hearted way " to fight the disease .

advisers have warned the ministry of agriculture -lrb- maff -rrb- that the slaughter of affected animals has to be done within 24 hours of suspected cases being reported .
if not they warn the crisis could get 10 times worse , with a projected 4,000 cases by june and half the uk 's 62 million farm animals in danger of being slaughtered .
we have watched with increasing anger as the government has continually underestimated the scale of the crisis william hague the spread of the disease is continuing to escalate , with 514 cases now confirmed in the uk and a second outbreak found in france , at a farm east of paris .
but there is some good news for the government , with maff figures to be released on saturday expected to show that the slaughter process is quickening .
it is now taking an average of 12 hours between cases being confirmed by vets and animals being slaughtered - about half what it was before .
but the continuing problem is in trying to speed up the period between farmers reporting suspected cases and slaughter .
the government hopes the increase in the number of vets , with volunteers from overseas and final year student recruits , will address this issue .
the average time taken to dispose of carcasses has now dropped four days in the first week of the crisis to 36 hours .
' long haul ' a downing street spokesman said : " it 's going to be a long haul but the pace is quickening .
we are starting to see a gear change on the ground and it 's a question of keeping the momentum going . "
the government 's chief scientific adviser , professor david king , said on friday the crisis was now out of control .
his comments directly contradicted advice from the agriculture minister , nick brown , who insisted the disease is under control .
the bbc 's political correspondent , laura trevelyan , said the government was sending out mixed messages and there was confusion about its overall strategy in tackling the epidemic .
mr brown 's admission that the government is undecided on whether to extend nationwide the pre-emptive cull of healthy animals within two miles of infected farms or opt for vaccination has fuelled these fears further .
tory leader william hague is expected to seize upon the government 's handling of the crisis and call on prime minister tony blair to appoint a " crisis cabinet " to meet daily until the outbreak is under control .
speaking to the conservative local government conference in coventry on saturday , he will accuse the government of failing to act quickly enough to contain and control the epidemic .
' crisis cabinet ' " we have watched with increasing exasperation and anger as the government has continually underestimated the scale of the crisis , " he is due to say .
" it has failed to act with anything like the necessary speed or vigour and has consistently shown itself to be behind the game .
" there is much more they could be doing and yet for some reason they refuse to do it .
" my message to the government is : get it together .
get a grip . "
the government will decide on saturday which of four sites in cumbria to use as a " cordon sanitaire " against the spread of foot-and-mouth .
downing street has said thousands of sheep will be moved to the site for slaughter once the choice has been made .
the intention is to pen and to slaughter all potentially affected animals in one place so the outbreak can be contained in south cumbria .
it has also been announced that the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- will be setting up a headquarters within maff offices .
the move is aimed at improving co-ordination of military resources .
meanwhile concern is being raised about illegal meat imports being smuggled into the country in consignments of fruit and vegetables .
customs officials say up to 200 batches of illegally imported meat are discovered every month , but many more are hidden in consignments of fruit because they are not subject to the same stringent checks as meat .
it is thought illegally imported meat could be a source of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .

' crisis cabinet ' " we have watched with increasing exasperation and anger as the government has continually underestimated the scale of the crisis , " he is due to say .
" it has failed to act with anything like the necessary speed or vigour and has consistently shown itself to be behind the game .
" there is much more they could be doing and yet for some reason they refuse to do it .
" my message to the government is : get it together .
get a grip . "
the government will decide on saturday which of four sites in cumbria to use as a " cordon sanitaire " against the spread of foot-and-mouth .
william hague : government should ' get a grip ' downing street has said thousands of sheep will be moved to the site for slaughter once the choice has been made .
the intention is to pen and to slaughter all potentially affected animals in one place so the outbreak can be contained in south cumbria .
it has also been announced that the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- will be setting up a headquarters within maff offices .
the move is aimed at improving co-ordination of military resources .
meanwhile concern is being raised about illegal meat imports being smuggled into the country in consignments of fruit and vegetables .
customs officials say up to 200 batches of illegally imported meat are discovered every month , but many more are hidden in consignments of fruit because they are not subject to the same stringent checks as meat .
it is thought illegally imported meat could be a source of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .

sweden , which currently holds the presidency of the eu , is hoping leaders will turn their attentions to the summit 's original agenda .
that was to discuss ways of making the european economy competitive in the digital age and tackling the worrying trends of a low birth rate in europe and an ageing population .
the eu 's leaders set themselves the goal at the lisbon summit last year of making the eu the most competitive - what they called knowledge-based - economy in the world by the year 2010 .
they agreed to liberalise the markets in telecommunications , transport and energy , to establish targets for job creation and to make it easier for eu citizens to move from one country to another .
progress reports they also decided that every spring summit would be devoted to monitoring progress over the 10-year timespan they set out at lisbon .
but this year 's summit has been dominated by more immediate concerns , and the economic climate now is very different than it was a year ago , with fears of a global economic slowdown .
sweden 's eu presidency has argued though that the stockholm summit has already produced one significant result - an agreement that goes some way to creating a single financial market in europe .
but other reforms may not be so easy to push through .
unions in some eu countries look set to resist reform of the welfare systems or opening up some industries to foreign ownership .
spain is likely to resist uk calls for single european air traffic control system because the plan includes gibraltar , which both countries claim .
the french , meanwhile , oppose uk prime minister tony blair 's desire for greater competition among energy and gas companies for fear that would lead to a lower standard of service .
eu leaders will also be asked to consider how the union will cope with the falling birth rate and ageing population .

estimates say cases have doubled in parts of the country over the past five years , particularly in poor areas .
when you have tb , do n't get despondent , just undertake your treatment archbishop desmond tutu increases in tb infection in africa as a whole have contributed to a global rise in cases , which were put at almost 8.5 million across the world in 1999 .
about a quarter of these cases result in death .
tuberculosis cases have increased by 6 % over two years , despite the widespread availability of drugs to tackle the condition .
the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- drew attention to the growing number of cases to mark world tuberculosis day on saturday .
tb scourge 5,000 deaths a day world 's biggest killer of women hiv / aids a factor in rise in cases curable with right drugs launching this year 's campaign , archbishop desmond tutu , himself once a tb sufferer , said those with the disease should ensure they seek treatment .
" there is life after tb , " he said .
" in fact when i had tb at one point they thought i was going to die and they told some people this - ' he 's on his way out ' .
the disease is still largely confined to the developing world " well , i 've been on my way out now for more than 50 years and i just want to say when you have tb , do n't get despondent , just undertake your treatment and you will be well . "
the most vulnerable are people with low resistance to disease - children and the elderly , the poor and people with hiv / aids .
high-density housing and crowded prisons are also known to increase the risk of exposure .
treatment hiv has increased the risk of tuberculosis , because it weakens immune systems .
where treatment is delivered in the correct way , we expect more than 90 % of patients to be cured dr chris dye , who unlike aids , there is a cure for tb - relatively cheap drugs are available .
but the difficulty is ensuring that patients complete their six-month course of antibiotics .
" where treatment is delivered in the correct way , we expect more than 90 % of patients to be cured , " chris dye of the world health organisation told the bbc .
" the problem is that in many poor countries , those drugs are not available , or patients do n't understand the importance - and indeed , health care workers do n't understand the importance of patients completing a full course of treatment - and for those reasons , the cure rates are often quite low . "
potential for epidemic since the 1950s the prevalence of tb has fallen dramatically in developed countries , but it has remained a constant threat in the developing world , especially in asia and africa .
but experts fear the emergence of drug resistant strains the emergence of drug-resistant strains of tb has renewed the threat it poses to the whole world .
that would transform the disease , already the world 's leading infectious killer , into a candidate for a deadly epidemic .
to co-ordinate international efforts to fight the disease , the who set up an initiative last year called stoptb .
this week , stoptb opened a global drug facility to finance and distribute enough drugs to treat up to 45 million patients by 2010 .
