with a multi-million dollar court case on the way , the bbc has learned that mcdonald 's has conceded that it may have confused customers over whether its fries were vegetarian , and so acceptable to hindus .
in 1990 , mcdonald 's announced with much fanfare that it would switch to cooking its fries in vegetable oil , making them acceptable to vegetarians who will not eat food cooked in beef fat .
however , it has now emerged that this is only part of the process .

american hindus have started legal action seeking damages , which they say could run to millions of dollars .
in india the revelation caused rioting until the company assured local people that the method of cooking there was strictly vegetarian .
mcdonald 's has nearly 30 restaurants in india , selling chicken , lamb and vegetarian products apology mcdonald 's has now conceded ground .
the corporation 's website on nutrition says it regrets if customers felt information was incomplete .
mcdonald 's fries are world famous a spokesman for mcdonald 's said : " we 're not too big to apologise . "
the company has also clarified its policy , saying that in predominantly muslim countries it conforms strictly to halal standards with no beef or pork flavouring .
but the apology is unlikely to head off the lawsuit in the united states being brought by the hindus , for whom the cow is a sacred animal .
in america , non-hindu vegetarians are divided on the issue .
some say they are outraged , but others say that the name mcdonald 's is synonymous with beef - so what did customers really expect ?

but pakistan made no immediate comment on india 's decision to end a six-month-old unilateral ceasefire in kashmir , which islamabad has previously termed a " farce " .
the indian foreign minister , jaswant singh , said prime minister atal behari vajpayee had decided to invite general musharraf to visit india " at his early convenience " .
we will respond positively when we receive the invitation officially pakistani foreign secretary inam-ul haq in response , pakistani foreign secretary inam-ul haq said general musharraf had repeatedly stressed the need for dialogue with india to resolve disputes .
he said the general had " more than once said that he is ready to meet and hold talks with the indian leadership anywhere , any time " .
possible breakthrough the bbc 's islamabad correspondent susannah price says that if the trip does materialise , it will be a major breakthrough .
there have been no official contacts between india and pakistan since fighting erupted in the kargil region of kashmir two years ago .
the conflict began when pakistani-backed forces took control of key mountain peaks .
mr singh said india 's unilateral ceasefire had ended because militant groups in the region had not co-operated and had continued with their campaign of violence .
reacting to delhi 's announcement , the main separatist alliance in indian-administered kashmir - the all parties hurriyat conference -lrb- aphc -rrb- - said it was an " insignificant " development , because the ceasefire " had never existed on the ground " .
' insignificant ' " non-initiation of combat operations is over .
security forces will act as they judge the situation best , " mr singh told journalists .
but the government statement said the troops would " continue to exercise maximum care that no harassment is caused to the civilian population . "
it was expected that various terrorist groups and organisations . . . would see reason and shun violence .
regrettably , they have not .
indian statement it said there had been relative peace along the line of control " on account of restraint exercised by both sides . "
militants who had continued fighting indian troops have yet to respond .
nearly 1,300 people have died in kashmir since the ceasefire was declared last november .
talks the indian government 's invitation to general musharraf comes as part of delhi 's recent initiative to begin talks with kashmiri separatists .
the bbc 's jill mcgivering says this is a bold move .
" india is yet again offering the hand of friendship , reconciliation , co-operation and peace to pakistan , in the expectation that this opportunity shall be positively and purposefully utilised by them , " the government statement said .
pakistan responded by saying a solution to the kashmir dispute should be found " through dialogue and in accordance with the wishes of the kashmiri people " .
separatist groups had called on delhi to involve pakistan in peace talks .
but india had insisted it would not do so unless islamabad ended its support for what it called terrorist actions in kashmir .
pakistan denies the charge .
as a result , most separatist leaders had shunned the indian invitation for talks .
more than 30,000 people have died in indian-administered kashmir since the separatist insurgency began in 1989 .
kashmir is divided between india and pakistan , who have fought two wars over it and came close to a third in the summer of 1999 .

after the meeting , the three opposition politicians said the prime minister had reiterated the government 's refusal to allow mr anwar to seek medical treatment abroad for a back problem .
they said his decision was final .
anwar ibrahim says his back condition , a slipped disc , was partly caused by a police beating in custody , but the government says it happened during a game of sport he was playing in prison .
mr anwar was dismissed from the cabinet in 1998 and jailed shortly afterwards when a court found him guilty of sodomy and corruption .

it was spring 1992 in the small bosnian town of bijeljina - and the first mass killings of the bosnian war were taking place .
i was just trying to document what was happening ron haviv the paramilitary ' tigers ' of zeljko raznatovic -lrb- alias arkan -rrb- were killing unarmed civilians .
gunmen had just shot two muslim women and a man .
as they lay there dying , taunted by their killers , ron haviv was able to take the photo he had vowed to take if he got the chance .
" it 's a horrific thing to see someone killed in front of you , " he said .
" the first time it happened i was n't allowed to take a photo .
" i could n't have saved them , but it made it worse that i could not tell the world about it .
" i made a promise to myself that if i was in that situation again i would at least be able to take a photo . "
' evidence ' haviv , an american photo-journalist , chronicled the long , painful break-up of yugoslavia throughout the 1990s .
click here for a photo gallery of ron haviv 's work .
he was in slovenia when it broke away from belgrade , witnessed the wars in croatia and bosnia and the conflict in kosovo .
his pictures show the raw agony of a land torn apart by ethnic hatred : a muslim captive pleading for mercy minutes before serb gunmen threw him from a window , a croatian child weeping at his father 's funeral , a field of snow stained with blood .
he thought he had the ability to control his own image ron haviv haviv , 35 , a contract photographer for newsweek , has won several world press awards , picture of the year awards , and numerous others .
he has gone right to the front-line of the balkans conflict , risking his own safety .
but haviv , who first went to the balkans when he was just starting his career in 1991 , sees his work as something he has to do .
" i never looked at it as courage , " he said .
" i was just trying to document what was happening .
" it 's a cliche but it 's important that the photojournalists and journalists are out there , documenting what 's happening and holding people accountable .
" the work does become evidence . "
' arkan 's ego ' that haviv was able to get close enough to take the photo of arkan 's militiaman kicking a dying woman , was because of an invitation by arkan himself .
arkan was furious when that picture was published and put out a death warrant on haviv , stating publicly that he looked forward to drinking his blood .
but arkan had personally invited haviv to photograph what he called the " liberation " of bijeljina from muslims .
" it was a combination of luck and playing to arkan 's ego , " said haviv .
" he was a very smart man , fluent in several languages and he thought he had the ability to control his own image .
" each time i photographed him and his men it was by his invitation .
" but it backfired for him " in january 2000 , arkan was shot dead - gunned down in the lobby of a belgrade hotel .
making a difference and ron haviv is still going back to the balkans - he was in macedonia for the start of the fighting earlier this year , and was outside former serb president slobodan milosevic 's house when he was arrested in april .
he believes his work in the balkans has made a difference , and that is what he hopes to carry on doing .
" journalists were showing more and more images from bosnia , and finally the politicians had to act , " he said .
" when it came to kosovo the politicians reacted much faster .
" i do n't believe photo-journalism alone can change anything , but i think the world would be very different without it . "

lough erne yacht club in county fermanagh is the base for the charity 's new enniskillen station .
the rnli already operates 224 lifeboat stations around the coast of the uk and republic of ireland .
but this will be its first base away from the coast on lough erne .
speaking about the station , angus watson , the rnli 's inland waters project manager said : " this is an exciting moment in the history of the rnli and for lifesaving in general . "
" we already operate one of the best lifeboat services in the world and we feel this is an opportunity to extend our skills to an inland water where we can really make a difference and potentially save more lives . "
on sunday , the rnli lifeboat took part in a search for a missing german tourist whose boat had run aground in lower lough erne .
station the man 's friend , also from germany , was killed after their cruiser ran aground on cleenishgarve island near castle archdale on lower lough erne .
enniskillen will become the 40th rnli station in ireland .
according to the organisation , the setting up of enniskillen lifeboat station is part of a pilot scheme to extend its lifesaving skills by providing a rescue service on large expanses of inland waters .
the charity said it is estimated that over 250 lives are lost each year around inland waters - more than around the coast .
the large stretch of water being covered extends across 50 square miles over two loughs which attract a high level of leisure activity including fishing , sailing , canoeing and over-the-water flying .
the organisation said the new lifeboat station would be served initially by an atlantic 21 inshore lifeboat but it may prove necessary to have additional resources on the lough in the long term .
eighteen lifeboat crew have been enrolled and trained ready for operation .

the composer of classic songs such as knockin ' on heavens door , times they are a changin ' and blowing in the wind has reportedly been on tour since 1988 and his appeal remains as strong as ever .
his song things have changed from the movie wonder boys won an oscar this year and this week he topped a poll of bbc news online users as the greatest lyricist of all time .
last week in new york patti smith , tracy chapman and sam shephard took part in a celebrity gala to pay tribute to the singer .
first album tribute concerts are also planned in australia , canada , france , italy and israel .
hs record company has embarked on a marketing push of his back catalogue and two new biographies have appeared on the market .
he invented the whole field we all work in joe strummer however , the man himself will be doing little to celebrate his birthday .
" absolutely no public plans , " said his spokesman , elliot mintz , when asked what the singer will be doing on thursday .
robert alan zimmerman was born on 24 may 1941 in hibbing , minnesota , and since his first album , called bob dylan , was released in 1962 he has gone on to produce more than 40 more .
he began his musical career as a folk artist but since then his music has generated a wide cross over appeal .
' infatuation ' he still tours extensively , performing more than 100 times a year and is about to embark on a european tour .
a select group of musician and writers have also paid their respects to the singer .
former clash singer joe strummer told bbc radio 4 's today programme that his infatuation with dylan began in the 1960s .
dylan 's like the beatles or the eiffel tower - he 's just there , his presence is so strong that you do n't really see him anymore david gray " he laid down the template for lyric , tune , seriousness , spirtuality , depth of rock music .
" without bob dylan i do n't think the form would be regarded . "
he added : " he invented the whole field we all work in . "
stevie wonder told the today programme that he considered bob dylan to be one of the finest ever lyricists .
poet laureate andrew motion told bbc news 24 that bob dylan 's lyrics had a strong poetic quality .
he said the lyrics to some of this songs were " fundamentally unlike anybody else writing now or then in the 1960s " .

the popularity of sms -lrb- short message service -rrb- messaging has attracted the attention of big businesses , which are about to start using the medium to send you adverts .
in a bid to ensure that companies do not abuse the messages , the wireless advertising association -lrb- waa -rrb- this week unveiled a voluntary code of conduct that it wants any company considering using sms ads to abide by .
central to the code of conduct was the necessity to seek permission from phone owners to send them adverts before they were bombarded with messages , said graham hardy , board member of the waa and marketing manager at technology company fusion one .
handling complaints " the mobile phone is very much the most personal device that anyone uses , " said mr hardy , adding that unwanted adverts could be a real affront to privacy .
" it would be very easy to get a bad reputation quickly and harder to repair it later , " he said .
" so , we want to make sure the standards and code of conduct are there from the start . "
the standards drawn up by the waa govern how long messages should be , how response rates should be measured , oblige companies sending adverts to make it obvious from whom they have come , and to make it easy to opt out of the service .
" this is going to be the year of the mobile phone advert , " said mr hardy .
but , so far , the waa is not prepared to handle complaints if unscrupulous companies start sending out unwanted messages , or spam , to phone owners .
a spokesman for the advertising standard authority said it was the regulator for the content of adverts and if ads were misleading or offensive , it would take up a complaints by phone users if they were being bombarded with unwanted messages .
early trials some advertisers have been sending adverts even before the standards were drawn up .
some shoppers at the lakeside shopping centre in essex have signed up for the zagme service , which lets them know about special offers in the mall while they are visiting .
the zagme service is now starting to expand to other malls and shopping centres .
earlier this year , wireless ad firm the mobile channel signed up 1,000 people for a trial of its service .
in return for taking part in the trial and receiving up to three adverts a day , the participants could ask for a donation to be made to a charity , or get vouchers for money off their phone bill , or off goods made by the advertisers .
companies who sent adverts by sms included carslberg , cadbury 's , interflora , tango , thomas cook and nationwide .
those signing up surrendered personal information and were sent ads only in categories they chose or from companies they liked .
the adverts sent ranged from reminders to buy particular goods or witty messages that mentioned particular products .
analysis of the trial showed that 74 % of triallists read all the messages they were sent , and 63 % replied to the message or did something as a result of it .
this stands in stark contrast to direct mail campaigns where response rates of 3 % or higher are considered a big success .
following the successful trial , the mobile channel is planning to launch its service in july and hopes to attract up to 250,000 customers by christmas .

exorcist director william friedkin and author william blatty both receive a share of profits from the film , but say that the values of deals warner struck with tv stations for the new version were deliberately kept low .
a warner spokesperson described the claim as " ludicrous " .
the film won two oscars in 1974 , and the re-issued version - which came out last year - included 11 extra minutes of footage and digitally enhanced sound .
friedkin and blatty claim that the deals were not as lucrative as they should have been because the film was sold to warner 's sister tv companies .
the turner television network -lrb- ttn -rrb- and turner broadcasting system -lrb- tbs -rrb- , which are part of aol time warner , paid no added license fee for the new version of the film , the lawsuit says .
and the cbs television network paid $ 1.5m -lrb- £ 1.06m -rrb- which was a quarter of the market price for the film , according to friedkin and blatty .
the lawsuit says this " extremely low rate " was set because of a special cbs arrangement with the turner companies .
both turner companies are named as defendants in the suit .
friedkin and blatty also say that the film was undervalued when it was sold as part of a 14-film package to tnt , tbs , the a & e cable network and various overseas broadcasters .
the package was worth $ 18m -lrb- £ 12.7m -rrb- but warner valued the exorcist at $ 110,000 -lrb- £ 77,800 -rrb- , less than the average and the same as films like the incredible mr limpet and it lives again .
warner spokeswoman barbara brogliatti said the studio has not seen the lawsuit .
" our policy is not to comment on matters that are in litigation , especially those that are ludicrous , " she said .
friedkin , who won an oscar for directing the french connection , receives 10 % of all net profits from the film .
blatty wrote both the best-selling novel on which the movie was based and the oscar-winning screenplay , and receives 39 % under his deal with warner .
the new version of the exorcist became the second most successful re-issue behind the star wars series after it went back to cinemas last year .
actors jason miller , who died recently , and ellen burnstyn and linda blair were all nominated for oscars for their roles in the original film .

k-for has been searching albanians on kosovo 's border by nick thorpe in skopje at gate b of the monteith us army base in south-east kosovo , there is a steady trickle of ethnic albanian rebels from nearby serbia .
all are in civilian dress and none carries weapons .
each is registered and photographed by american soldiers , and invited to sign a piece of paper acknowledging that they will not be allowed to return to southern serbia for the foreseeable future .
and then they can go .
yugoslav forces are reoccupying serbia 's buffer zones they walk away as free men , into the dusty town of gnjilane , to catch a bus to somewhere else in kosovo .
they have escaped prosecution in serbia as terrorists but their future role , as a factor of stability or instability in the balkans , remains uncertain .
in southern serbia a formula was devised by nato mediators , and accepted by both the guerrillas and the yugoslav authorities , which allows for an immediate halt to the bloodshed .
hundreds of guerrillas have already entered kosovo , to take advantage of the amnesty .
the final figure - by the 31 may deadline - may run into the thousands .
policy change for the past 15 months their group , known as the liberation army of presevo , medvedja and bujanovac -lrb- ucpmb -rrb- has been fighting serbian security forces in the presevo valley .
the ucpmb appeals to several generations of albanians taking advantage of the peace terms which ended the nato bombing of yugoslavia two years ago , the guerrillas set up their bases in a narrow , five-kilometre buffer zone ringing kosovo .
the zone was originally meant to prevent clashes between k-for , the nato-led peacekeeping mission in kosovo , and the yugoslav army .
but the fall of slobodan milosevic last october , and the coming to power of a democratic , pro-western government in belgrade , caused a dramatic shift in policy .
serbia 's new leaders began to speak about rights for the large albanian minority in the presevo valley and were even willing to sit with albanian rebel leaders - ' terrorists ' as they call them - to strike a deal .
sister group the situation so far has been very different in nearby macedonia .
if the kla , - the ethnic albanian kosovo liberation army - was the mother of the ucpmb , then the other daughter in the family is the nla - the national liberation army of macedonian albanians .
once again the balkans are teetering on a knife-edge , between peace and war .
they revealed their existence in february this year , with an attack on a police station north of the city of tetovo .
in march , they seized a number of villages in the same area .
shelled by the army , they withdrew with few casualties on either side and the army declared victory .
but the rebels simply regrouped and occupied another string of villages , just north of the city of kumanovo .
since then , a new government of national unity has been formed in skopje .
but the rebels treat the albanian politicians in that government with contempt , and claim to be the real representatives of albanian aspirations in macedonia - to win equal rights .
the macedonian media and visiting western statesmen describe them as terrorists .
but the nla wear uniforms , control checkpoints , and do not bomb civilian targets .
each day they have been opening fire at police and army positions above kumanovo and , increasingly , above tetovo again .
and every day the macedonian army has been shelling them from the front lines - sometimes less than a kilometre away .
unbearable situation that situation was becoming increasingly unbearable for all sides .
rexhep , an ucpmb fighter from southern serbia , said he would join the rebels in macedonia " if the nation needs me " .
fighting is continuing in macedonia each day , albanian newspapers in kosovo list the alleged atrocities of the macedonian army against the albanians in macedonia , just as the macedonian media write of the alleged atrocities committed by the albanian " terrorists " .

k-for has been searching albanians on kosovo 's border by nick thorpe in skopje at gate b of the monteith us army base in south-east kosovo , there is a steady trickle of ethnic albanian rebels from nearby serbia .
all are in civilian dress and none carries weapons .
each is registered and photographed by american soldiers , and invited to sign a piece of paper acknowledging that they will not be allowed to return to southern serbia for the foreseeable future .
and then they can go .
they walk away as free men , into the dusty town of gnjilane , to catch a bus to somewhere else in kosovo .
they have escaped prosecution in serbia as terrorists but their future role , as a factor of stability or instability in the balkans , remains uncertain .
in southern serbia a formula was devised by nato mediators , and accepted by both the guerrillas and the yugoslav authorities , which allows for an immediate halt to the bloodshed .
hundreds of guerrillas have already entered kosovo , to take advantage of the amnesty .
the final figure - by the 31 may deadline - may run into the thousands .
policy change for the past 15 months their group , known as the liberation army of presevo , medvedja and bujanovac -lrb- ucpmb -rrb- has been fighting serbian security forces in the presevo valley .
taking advantage of the peace terms which ended the nato bombing of yugoslavia two years ago , the guerrillas set up their bases in a narrow , five-kilometre buffer zone ringing kosovo .
the zone was originally meant to prevent clashes between k-for , the nato-led peacekeeping mission in kosovo , and the yugoslav army .
but the fall of slobodan milosevic last october , and the coming to power of a democratic , pro-western government in belgrade , caused a dramatic shift in policy .
serbia 's new leaders began to speak about rights for the large albanian minority in the presevo valley and were even willing to sit with albanian rebel leaders - ' terrorists ' as they call them - to strike a deal .
sister group the situation so far has been very different in nearby macedonia .
if the kla , - the ethnic albanian kosovo liberation army - was the mother of the ucpmb , then the other daughter in the family is the nla - the national liberation army of macedonian albanians .
once again the balkans are teetering on a knife-edge , between peace and war .
they revealed their existence in february this year , with an attack on a police station north of the city of tetovo .
in march , they seized a number of villages in the same area .
shelled by the army , they withdrew with few casualties on either side and the army declared victory .
but the rebels simply regrouped and occupied another string of villages , just north of the city of kumanovo .
since then , a new government of national unity has been formed in skopje .
but the rebels treat the albanian politicians in that government with contempt , and claim to be the real representatives of albanian aspirations in macedonia - to win equal rights .
the macedonian media and visiting western statesmen describe them as terrorists .
but the nla wear uniforms , control checkpoints , and do not bomb civilian targets .
each day they have been opening fire at police and army positions above kumanovo and , increasingly , above tetovo again .
and every day the macedonian army has been shelling them from the front lines - sometimes less than a kilometre away .
unbearable situation that situation was becoming increasingly unbearable for all sides .
rexhep , an ucpmb fighter from southern serbia , said he would join the rebels in macedonia " if the nation needs me " .
each day , albanian newspapers in kosovo list the alleged atrocities of the macedonian army against the albanians in macedonia , just as the macedonian media write of the alleged atrocities committed by the albanian " terrorists " .
meanwhile 10,000 civilians remain in the cellars of villages like slupcane , vakcince , lojane and lipkovo , in northern macedonia , as their homes are torn apart by shells .
nla withdrawal ?
several sides predicted something might happen as yugoslav forces began to return to the last section , sector b , of the buffer-zone around kosovo on thursday .

italy 's president ciampi attended a gala concert of works by verdi , wagner and bolini , attended by some 900 people , including politicians , cultural figures and italian celebrities .
the malibran will house the venice opera company , which has been without a home since la fenice was destroyed by fire in 1996 .
venice opera company director isaac karabt chevsky said it was like having a home again after being vagabonds - the company has been performing in a large circus tent on the outskirts of the city .
venice 's authorities are still keen that la fenice is rebuilt - though a series of bureaucratic hitches means this will not happen till 2003 .
mayor of venice paolo costa said the reopening of the malibran did not mean they were any less determined to rebuild la fenice .
mayor costa has recently sacked the contractors who were behind schedule and over budget .
until la fenice is rebuilt , the restored malibran will resume the central role it played in venetian cultural life when it opened in 1678 - it was venice 's only musical theatre until 1747 .
as one of europe 's oldest musical theatres it was renowned throughout the continent for its performances .
the theatre takes its current name - it was formerly teatro san giovanni grisostomo - from maria malibran , the most famous lyric singer in the early 1800s .
when the venice city council bought the theatre in 1992 it had been in disrepair and little used for more than a decade .

the pound fell slightly against the euro but stayed just a fifth of a penny away from this year 's high - set on wednesday when the single currency tumbled on bad economic news from france and germany .
the currency markets appeared nervous ahead of the release of the confederation of british industry 's report on the manufacturing sector due at 1000 gmt .
" we 're expecting the cbi report to be on the weak side and this could be negative for sterling , " said jeremy hawkins , chief economic adviser at bank of america .
at 0730 gmt , sterling was trading around $ 1.4125 after hitting six-month lows just below $ 1.4110 in the asian session .
euro rises the euro has rebounded one percent against the dollar after it fell to $ 0.8555 in asian trade , its lowest level since november last year .
rumours of intervention in the currency markets by the bundesbank and the bank of japan , combined with supportive comments by the japanese finance minister masajuro shiokawa , helped the euro bounce back against the dollar .
in october the euro reached an all time low of $ 0.8230 .
the slide , which started ahead of a decision by the european central bank to maintain interest rates at 4.5 % , has been blamed on a clutch of data hinting that europe 's major economies may be growing slower than analysts had predicted .
french slowdown the french economy , which many observers have viewed as a beacon of hope , grew by a disappointing 0.5 % in the first three months of the year , compared with the quarter before , a report showed .
official statisticians , who also revised down growth for the last quarter of last year from 1 % to 0.8 % , said the " surprising data " reflected a fall in corporate spending as bosses tightened purse strings .
and laurent fabius , french finance minister , said the " disappointing " figure could see economic output , or gdp , grow by less than the 2.9 % forecast by the government .
below forecasts analysts were further disheartened by figures showing that the german economy , the largest within the eurozone , had an annual growth rate of only 2 % between january and march .
the figure , the lowest since autumn 1999 , heightened fears that the german economy will expand this year by less than the officials have predicted .
the government recently downgraded its official forecast for economic growth from 2.75 % to " around " 2 % .
inflation data also revealed on wednesday intensified the gloom over the german economy , showing that prices were 3.5 % higher this month than in may 2000 .
this figure was the highest since december 1993 .
inflation fears disappointingly high levels of inflation within the eurozone have dissuaded ecb chiefs from reducing interest rates , and so helping to revive flagging economic growth .
the ecb 's decision on wednesday to keep interest rates on hold was widely expected by economists .
two weeks ago , the ecb surprised markets by lowering the rate from 4.75 % - its first cut in two years .
economists and politicians have criticised the bank for waiting so long to make a cut to shore up the economy , and for its lack of transparency .
high interest rates are viewed by economists as a key weapon in the fight to trim price rises .
eurozone inflation , which the ecb is charged with keeping below 2 % , stood at 2.9 % in april .

the study - by the health charity marie stopes international - said one in five of those questioned said they had full sex while they were away from home when they were 16 or under .
a quarter said they used no contraception .
one in three of those questioned said they had some kind of sexual experience on a trip , some when they were as young as 11 or 12 .
this does not mean that school trips should be stopped .
tony kerridge , marie stopes international researchers spoke to 900 people aged between 17 and 19 who had been on a school trip involving at least one overnight stay .
the charity said being away from their parents gave teenagers an opportunity to have sex that they would not have at home .
a spokesman for the organisation , tony kerridge , said it was not calling for an end to such trips : " this does not mean that school trips should be stopped , but that young people should be given more education about sex and the risks involved . "
dr marianne parry , the medical director of marie stopes international said : " what is really worrying is that a quarter of respondents did n't use any contraception at all and put themselves at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections and experiencing crisis pregnancies .
" if these findings are reflected nationally , a quarter of young people on school trips having unprotected sex is a real cause for concern . "
advice for pupils marie stopes international has produced a schools edition of a booklet called " your passport to sexual health " .
it gives pupils advice on how to resist peer pressure to have sex and information about contraception and the dangers of sexually transmitted infections .
dr parry said young people should think " long and hard " before they embarked on sexual activity while away from home .
mr kerridge said : " britain has the highest rate of teenage pregnancies in western europe .
" all the evidence from the continent suggests that the best way to discourage early sexual activity is to give young people all the facts . "

there is of course no bigger prize than the palme d 'or , which moretti won on sunday for the son 's room .
he was the first italian director to win the prize since 1978 .
the venice film festival is just as glamorous and star-studded as cannes , with many major hollywood stars in attendance .
fraught moretti 's relationship with the venice festival has been somewhat fraught at times , from the time when his 1989 film palombella rossa -lrb- red wood pigeon -rrb- was rejected for selection .
the film was eventually screened in the separate critics week section .
since then , the director 's films have all been screened .
the venice film festival is perhaps a more commercial prospect than its cannes equivalent , with more hollywood films and their stars in attendance .
last year , harrison ford and michelle pfeiffer attended for the premiere of what lies beneath .
clint eastwood was presented with a golden lion special award for his career , a body of work spanning some 40 years .
the venice festival is the world 's oldest film event and its special award is recognised as one of the most prestigious in the movie industry .
despite the strong hollywood presence , of the 20 pictures in competition for the coveted golden lion trophy last year , only two came from the us .
the prize was won by iranian film the circle .
major retrospective moretti 's invitation to sit on the venice jury comes at a time when his films are to get wide exposure in the united states .
the son 's room will premiere in north america later this month as the opening film of a complete retrospective of the italian writer-director-actor 's work .
starting on 31 may with the premiere to be attended by moretti and finishing on 3 june , the run will allow american audiences to see many films previously unreleased .
felix laudadio , president of cinecitta holdings said : " this will be an event of exceptional importance for italian cinema , which has been experiencing a strong revival in the past year . "
the other members of the venice jury will be announced on 27 july in rome .
the festival itself runs from 20 august to 8 september .

the study - by the health charity marie stopes international - said one in five of those questioned said they had full sex while they were away from home when they were 16 or under .
a quarter said they used no contraception .
one in three of those questioned said they had some kind of sexual experience on a trip , some when they were as young as 11 or 12 .
this does not mean that school trips should be stopped .
tony kerridge , marie stopes international researchers spoke to 900 people aged between 17 and 19 who had been on a school trip involving at least one overnight stay .
the charity said being away from their parents gave teenagers an opportunity to have sex that they would not have at home .
a spokesman for the organisation , tony kerridge , said it was not calling for an end to such trips : " this does not mean that school trips should be stopped , but that young people should be given more education about sex and the risks involved . "
dr marianne parry , the medical director of marie stopes international said : " what is really worrying is that a quarter of respondents did n't use any contraception at all and put themselves at risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections and experiencing crisis pregnancies .
" if these findings are reflected nationally , a quarter of young people on school trips having unprotected sex is a real cause for concern . "
advice for pupils marie stopes international has produced a schools edition of a booklet called " your passport to sexual health " .
it gives pupils advice on how to resist peer pressure to have sex and information about contraception and the dangers of sexually transmitted infections .
dr parry said young people should think " long and hard " before they embarked on sexual activity while away from home .
mr kerridge said : " britain has the highest rate of teenage pregnancies in western europe .
" all the evidence from the continent suggests that the best way to discourage early sexual activity is to give young people all the facts . "
