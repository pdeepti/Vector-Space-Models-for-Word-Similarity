unfortunately because of the ever demanding nature of my job in bbc newsgathering , i rarely have the opportunity to attend as many football matches as i would like to , whether they are home or away games .
but on wednesday i was determined to go to the match , against our great rivals kaizer chiefs .
i left the bbc bureau slightly early to make sure i could get a seat at south africa 's famous world-class stadium ellis park .
medics administered treatment on the pitch when i got to the stadium an hour before kick-off , the ticket queues were snaking ahead well into the distance and i was so impatient i could not bear standing in the long line to buy my ticket .
fortunately i recognised a friend who was close to the sales window and he kindly agreed to buy me a ticket at the same time as he bought his .
my heart was beating fast with excitement .
fans from both teams were filing past me with all sorts of celebratory regalia , singing , chanting and blowing real animal horns .
there was nothing odd about the size of the crowd , this was the biggest football derby in the country .
johannesburg on wednesday evening had a gentle autumn breeze softly blowing on crowds as they made their way into the stadium .
i managed successfully to get inside and got one of the last seats available .
the metal gates were twisted by the crush ellis park was packed to capacity 45 minutes before kick off , local music groups provided entertainment on the pitch , there was dancing and singing all around me .
as people were taking up space on the aisle between the stands , it became more and more difficult to move .
gradually , the pushing and shoving was becoming unbearable .
at first i thought it was going stop when the match began , but how wrong i was .
fans who were sitting on the steps down the aisle were getting more and more squashed by the incoming crowd - it was absolutely clear that there was no more room in that area .
the first thing i did was stand up and see how many people were still trying to get in .
there were thousands still coming in .
i and most people who were seated near to me had to stand on our seats to avoid the crush .
those who were not quick enough were getting crushed .
shocked fans wept after their ordeal our screams were as loud as humanly possible but the pa system and the rest of the stadium crowd just drowned out our voices .
when the whistle was blown and the match began , this just fuelled the stampede .
the crowd outside the stadium surged forward even more , only this time with greater force .
suddenly a few security guards and marshals were battling against a human tide .
as if this was not enough , kaizer chiefs scored the first goal and all hell broke loose .
those who were still outside pushed down the stadium steel gates and rushed in to join the people who were already being squashed and crushed - they wanted to see which team had scored the first goal of the match .
it was horrible .
together with those next to me i screamed and whistled , trying to draw the attention of the match officials to stop the game .
but the noise of the rest of the crowd in the stadium who were following every pass , every tackle and every move of the ball , was just too much for them to hear our cries .
they probably thought we were rooting for our teams .
a friend tried to use a belt to deter the crowd from surging forward but he failed , dismally .
i shouted to him : " banzi , if we do n't get away from here we are going to be crushed to death ! "
terrifying journey i then started the terrifying journey that led to my survival - walking , pushing , shoving , screaming with both my feet off the ground .
i had to walk on other people to save my own life .
others were pushing me away as i forced my way out of the chaos .
as i left the ellis park stadium .
i saw shoes , bags , people 's belongings spread across the outer perimeters of the stadium .
it looked like the aftermath of a riot .
some of the steel bars used for channelling queues were torn free of their cement bases .
hard lesson i felt relieved as i walked to my car that i could still walk and breath .
by that time orlando pirates had equalised , but the match was only stopped when the officials realised what had been happening in the grandstands .
the stampede was eventually stopped too , but a heavy price was paid by those who died in it .
like the hillsborough tragedy in england 12 years ago , almost to the day , south africa has learnt about the need for crowd control the hard way .
i had gone to the stadium to watch and enjoy my team beat our arch rivals , but my dream was snatched away by a tragedy that was both an accident and partly caused by human error .
as we go through this black easter weekend , we keep our hopes high that a tragedy like this will never happen here again .

johannesburg on wednesday evening had a gentle autumn breeze softly blowing on crowds as they made their way into the stadium .
i managed successfully to get inside and got one of the last seats available .
ellis park was packed to capacity 45 minutes before kick off , local music groups provided entertainment on the pitch , there was dancing and singing all around me .
as people were taking up space on the aisle between the stands , it became more and more difficult to move .
gradually , the pushing and shoving was becoming unbearable .
at first i thought it was going stop when the match began , but how wrong i was .
fans who were sitting on the steps down the aisle were getting more and more squashed by the incoming crowd - it was absolutely clear that there was no more room in that area .
the first thing i did was stand up and see how many people were still trying to get in .
there were thousands still coming in .
i and most people who were seated near to me had to stand on our seats to avoid the crush .
those who were not quick enough were getting crushed .
our screams were as loud as humanly possible but the pa system and the rest of the stadium crowd just drowned out our voices .
when the whistle was blown and the match began , this just fuelled the stampede .
the crowd outside the stadium surged forward even more , only this time with greater force .
suddenly a few security guards and marshals were battling against a human tide .
as if this was not enough , kaizer chiefs scored the first goal and all hell broke loose .
those who were still outside pushed down the stadium steel gates and rushed in to join the people who were already being squashed and crushed - they wanted to see which team had scored the first goal of the match .
it was horrible .
together with those next to me i screamed and whistled , trying to draw the attention of the match officials to stop the game .
but the noise of the rest of the crowd in the stadium who were following every pass , every tackle and every move of the ball , was just too much for them to hear our cries .
they probably thought we were rooting for our teams .
a friend tried to use a belt to deter the crowd from surging forward but he failed , dismally .
i shouted to him : " banzi , if we do n't get away from here we are going to be crushed to death ! "
terrifying journey i then started the terrifying journey that led to my survival - walking , pushing , shoving , screaming with both my feet off the ground .
i had to walk on other people to save my own life .
others were pushing me away as i forced my way out of the chaos .
as i left the ellis park stadium .
i saw shoes , bags , people 's belongings spread across the outer perimeters of the stadium .
it looked like the aftermath of a riot .
some of the steel bars used for channelling queues were torn free of their cement bases .
hard lesson i felt relieved as i walked to my car that i could still walk and breath .
by that time orlando pirates had equalised , but the match was only stopped when the officials realised what had been happening in the grandstands .
the stampede was eventually stopped too , but a heavy price was paid by those who died in it .
like the hillsborough tragedy in england 12 years ago , almost to the day , south africa has learnt about the need for crowd control the hard way .
i had gone to the stadium to watch and enjoy my team beat our arch rivals , but my dream was snatched away by a tragedy that was both an accident and partly caused by human error .
as we go through this black easter weekend , we keep our hopes high that a tragedy like this will never happen here again .

australian green leader bob brown , a senator in his country 's national parliament , told the bbc in an interview that there was support for such a boycott unless president bush reversed his decision to reject the kyoto agreement on measures to tackle global warning - a move he said was influenced by the oil companies .
a global force at the start of this century that is going to challenge the old parties and the economic rationalist philosophy senator bob brown mr brown said the conference was aiming to challenge the growing international influence of major corporations .
international environmental group greenpeace is said to be leading the initiative .
it has given us oil companies 10 days to detach themselves from the bush decision , according to european greens secretary general arnold cassola .
mr bush announced last month that he was not prepared to ratify the kyoto treaty because it could have a negative effect on the us economy .
need for power mr brown said the goal of the green movement was to be more than a mere lobby group , to fight against global warming and for stronger democracy in mainstream politics .
" experience over the last 30 years has shown that being a protest party is not enough , if you want to attain change , you need some power , " he said .
the aim was to ensure that the corporations were not at an unfair advantage politically because of their considerable financial influence .
green parties already exist in more than 80 countries , and have seats in 29 national parliaments .
they are participants in coalition governments in germany , france , italy , belgium , finland , slovenia and mexico .

deputy assistant commissioner alan fry , head of scotland yard 's anti-terrorist branch , said : " we believe -lsb- the bomb -rsb- contained between half and one pound of high explosives , which was a similar size to the device at hammersmith bridge in june last year . "
the hammersmith device exploded at 0430bst on 1 june 2000 .
no-one was injured in the blast and the bridge was not extensively damaged by the bomb .
residents living near the scene of the explosion described how windows in their homes were blown out by the force of the blast .
sarah pleat was at her home in goldhawk road , shepherd 's bush , about a mile from the scene .
" i was lying in bed when i heard an enormous shudder and the windows started shaking , " she said .
" i bolted upright and the tremor lasted for a good few seconds .
i bolted upright and the tremor lasted for a good few seconds .
sarah pleat " i looked out of the window but could not see anything , it was extremely eerie . "
anti-terrorist police set up roadblocks in west london in their hunt for the bombers .
drivers and pedestrians in hammersmith and on nearby bridges were stopped , searched and questioned as security in the capital was stepped up .
no-one admitted carrying out the attack , despite speculation that it could have been the work of dissident irish republicans opposed to the northern ireland peace process .
hammersmith bridge had been targeted twice before by terrorists , including in 1996 when a powerful semtex bomb failed to detonate .
