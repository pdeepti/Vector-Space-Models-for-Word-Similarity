one of those areas is the northern tip of the arctic national wildlife refuge in alaska , which is thought to contain substantial oil reserves .
but the plan is being condemned by environmental groups who say drilling could damage the fragile ecosystem there .
the bbc 's richard lister reports from the area .
the traditional image most people have of the arctic , myself included , is of a vast , featureless blanket of ice , inhabited by polar bears and the occasional eskimo .
the reality is that there are several different kinds of arctic , even within that part of it which is us territory .
there are places where the sea ice stretches to the horizon , broken only by the occasional , trapped iceberg .
here you can find polar bears in increasing numbers .
elsewhere , there are stunning , mountain ranges with trees and rivers , home to caribou , wolves and the occasional musk ox .
it is also a region that produces about a million barrels of oil a day .
prudhoe bay is a network of gravel roads , production plants and drilling derricks .
gas flares line the horizon .
the oil companies want to drill in the northern part of the arctic national wildlife refuge -lrb- anwr -rrb- , and for the most part the native inupiat people support the plan .
many still live in tiny , remote settlements along the north coast .
they described themselves to me as eskimos - even though many such groups elsewhere object to the term .
the igloo -lrb- or iglu -rrb- and the sod house have now gone , but the people retain many traditional activities such as whaling , and they celebrate their unique culture at spring festivals throughout the region .
but much of their income now comes from taxes on the oil companies , and i found few people who opposed new onshore drilling - even in anwr .
the strongest voices against , came from the gwich 'en indians further south , who feared the impact on caribou herds .
over the course of 11 days , we travelled to barrow , prudhoe bay , the inupiat village of kaktovic and arctic village , home of the grich 'en people .
we flew in small propeller planes to landing strips often longer than the villages themselves .
we avoided the worst of the cold weather , but it still froze hard enough to snap pieces off our tripod and camera , and make staying warm a constant challenge .
the upside was that there were almost 24 hours of daylight , in which to film this extraordinary region .
it is now facing considerable change from global warming , america 's demand for oil and the desire by the native people themselves to maintain their culture , even as they seek a more secure future .

with the row over the spy plane rumbling on , state department spokesman richard boucher said : " we are interested in the fastest return of the plane .
we think that is in china 's interest as well as ours . "
" china has constantly opposed us spy flights off china 's coast and will continue to lodge serious representations with the united states on the resumption of such flights " chinese foreign ministry spokesman , sun yuxi chinese officials have said that it is " impossible " for the plane to fly off hainan island , where it has been stranded , however , a us technical inspection team that was allowed access to the plane reported back on saturday that it would be air-worthy after some repairs .
on tuesday , china reacted angrily to the resumption of us surveillance flights along its coast for the first time since the collision .
foreign ministry spokesman sun yuxi was quoted by xinhua news agency as saying that china would urge washington to " correct such wrongdoings . "
official complaint " china has constantly opposed us spy flights off china 's coast and will continue to lodge serious representations with the united states on the resumption of such flights , " mr sun said . "
they made clear that they object to the flights and we made equally clear that these are flights that are conducted as part of us national and regional security efforts " state department spokesman richard boucher the state department acknowledged that beijing had lodged an official complaint over the surveillance flights with the us embassy in beijing .
" they made clear that they object to the flights and we made equally clear that these are flights that are conducted as part of us national and regional security efforts and we would expect to continue them on that basis in international airspace , " mr boucher said .
diplomatic row the collision at the beginning of april sparked a serious diplomatic dispute between the two countries , which deepened with disagreements over us arms sales to taiwan and washington 's plans to develop a missile defence shield .
a pentagon official disclosed on monday that an unarmed rc-135 surveillance plane had taken off from kadena air base on the japanese island of okinawa , and flown along a routine route close to the northern portion of china 's coastline .
white house spokesman ari fleischer has repeatedly said that us believed in its " prerogative and right to fly over international air space to preserve the peace by flying reconnaissance missions " .
china views such flights as provocative and damaging to its national security , and argues they may be illegal under international conventions .
the bbc beijing correspondent says their resumption after a month 's suspension is further evidence that the bush administration is adopting a more confrontational stance towards china .

the moroccan hosts of the meeting said that it is hoped the four countries will have set up the zone by the end of this year and that other arab countries will also join during the next decade .
financial experts are sceptical that the arab states might be in a position to form an eu or nafta-style bloc the moroccan foreign minister , mohammed benaissa , likened the agreement reached by the four arab states to the european coal and steel convention of 1958 that was to evolve into the european economic community and later the eu .
foreign ministers from a number of non-participating arab countries were also present to witness the signing of the declaration in the southern moroccan resort of agadir .
scepticism but financial experts are sceptical that the arab states might be in a position to form an eu or nafta-style bloc .
not only does the region incorporate a wide range of political views and economic systems , but the arab countries have little to trade between themselves other than energy and agricultural goods .
the exchange of goods with europe is much more substantial .
the arab free trade agreement needs to be seen in the wider context of the euro-mediterranean process taking place in which the eu and arab countries hope to create a free trade zone by the year 2010 that incorporates all 27 countries .
that process reaches its next milestone on thursday when the arab foreign ministers in morocco will be joined by five of their eu counterparts , as well as from turkey and malta , to discuss the way forward .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- mg rover boss paints bright future low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo john towers " bmw 's large investment gave us a good start " real 56k john towers " the car industry is sophisticated , sometimes " real 56k john towers " we now make decisions more quickly " real 56k john towers " i think we would chose a partnership with component suppliers " real 28k john towers " do n't make higher prices a fundamental part of the business " real 28k john towers " we do not want control for the sake of it " real 28k wednesday , 9 may , 2001 , 06:58 gmt 07:58 uk mg rover boss paints bright future towers : partnership with component suppliers would make a lot of sense new partnerships and new car models are firmly on mg rover 's radar , a year after its german parent bmw dismissed it as a dying patient .
in an exclusive interview , chairman john towers tells bbc news online 's jorn madslien about mg rover 's vision for the future .
it is exactly one year since the german car maker bmw sold its uk subsidiary rover for a symbolic Â£ 10 in order to prevent its losses from escalating .
my fear is that a major collaboration with a major car maker would pull us back to the old habits that took years rather than months to do things that should only take months john towers and already , the british car maker 's new boss is talking about breaking even , perhaps as early as 2002 .
but getting back in the black seems like a mindboggling task for anyone who has been listening to financial analysts during the past year , even though mg rover has slashed its losses from Â£ 750m to less than Â£ 300m .
mr towers says many analysts have no idea .
" i 've said to people time and time again that there 've been an awful lot of wise men outside of this business telling people what 's going to happen to this business , " he said .
" unfortunately , they 're the same wise men who told us to invest in the dot.com miracles about a year ago , and more latterly to invest in the mobile telecommunications boom . "
city analysts but despite his disregard for the " nay-sayers " , mr towers does spend a lot of time trying to win over the city analysts .
partnership with a large car maker would cramp our style .
peculiar , perhaps , for the boss of a privately owned company with no plans to float on the stock market .
but mr towers insists that " it matters what the city thinks because the press tend to report what the city thinks .
and what is reported in the press matters to us because our customers read it " .
investment mg rover aims to survive as a medium-sized car maker , selling about 200,000 cars a year .
mr towers insists that the new mgs are more than just re-badged rovers .
about half the cars are exported , with the proportion likely to grow as " the territorial movement is certainly going to be upwards " , said mr towers .

in an exclusive interview , chairman john towers tells bbc news online 's jorn madslien about mg rover 's vision for the future .
it is exactly one year since the german car maker bmw sold its uk subsidiary rover for a symbolic Â£ 10 in order to prevent its losses from escalating .
my fear is that a major collaboration with a major car maker would pull us back to the old habits that took years rather than months to do things that should only take months john towers and already , the british car maker 's new boss is talking about breaking even , perhaps as early as 2002 .
but getting back in the black seems like a mindboggling task for anyone who has been listening to financial analysts during the past year , even though mg rover has slashed its losses from Â£ 750m to less than Â£ 300m .
mr towers says many analysts have no idea .
" i 've said to people time and time again that there 've been an awful lot of wise men outside of this business telling people what 's going to happen to this business , " he said .
" unfortunately , they 're the same wise men who told us to invest in the dot.com miracles about a year ago , and more latterly to invest in the mobile telecommunications boom . "
city analysts but despite his disregard for the " nay-sayers " , mr towers does spend a lot of time trying to win over the city analysts .
peculiar , perhaps , for the boss of a privately owned company with no plans to float on the stock market .
but mr towers insists that " it matters what the city thinks because the press tend to report what the city thinks .
and what is reported in the press matters to us because our customers read it " .
investment mg rover aims to survive as a medium-sized car maker , selling about 200,000 cars a year .
about half the cars are exported , with the proportion likely to grow as " the territorial movement is certainly going to be upwards " , said mr towers .
" remember the starting point .
remember that Â£ 3bn worth of investment was poured into this business -lsb- by bmw -rsb- . "
" the platforms , the cars , they were all re-engineered .
the rover 75 was brand new , " said an enthusiastic mr towers , clearly pleased with his consortium 's Â£ 10 bargain .
" masses of investment poured into the model range gave us a terrific starting point .

the musical extravaganza took almost five years to complete , due to the complexity of the production and post-production process .
but luhrmann 's patience has paid off with moulin rouge 's global box office success .
" without an iota of exaggeration , this film personally , emotionally and creatively tested me to my outer limits , " said luhrmann , in an interview with the los angeles times .
unexpected the action takes place in 19th century paris and follows the story of a poet , played by mcgregor .
he defies his father by moving to the city 's seedy , artistic hotbed montmartre .
mcgregor and kidman dance to contemporary music he falls into the world of the fast-living artist toulouse-lautrec and his entourage and is drafted to write a nightclub spectacular .
in this world of sex , drugs and electricity , he begins a passionate but ultimately doomed love affair with the club 's highest paid star and courtesan , played by kidman .

the colours and costumes are garish and exuberant and the sets epic in size .
musically too , the film is unexpected , as luhrmann uses sounds from artists such as madonna , elton john , christina aguilera and nirvana .
luhrmann decribed his film as a musical comic-tragedy .
his inspiration came from a mixture of the orpheus myth and the stylised extravagance of india 's bollywood movies .
" what i thought was amazing about those movies was -lrb- the mix -rrb- of high comedy , high tragedy and people breaking into musical numbers , " he said .

during filming kidman was injured in a fall on set and later had to have surgery on her knee .
strictly ballroom was a success at cannes in 1992 this delayed the end of shooting and also meant the actress had to pull out of her next project the panic room .
her part was taken by jodie foster , who stepped down as this year 's cannes jury president to do so .
given his past record at cannes , luhrmann would be excused for being quietly confident about the reaction to moulin rouge at the festival .
his first film strictly ballroom - a vibrant romantic musical comedy - caused a splash at the festival in 1992 and became an international hit .
his second feature was romeo and juliet , starring leonardo dicaprio and claire danes .
again in the post-modern theme , luhrmann reconceived shakespeare 's story of doomed teenage love .
he set the film in the designer-clad environment of verona beach , complete with an eclectic modern soundtrack and shakespeare 's prose delivered in modern vernacular .

farmer tony marlow said that the trial at mathry in pembrokeshire , had been called off because of a " a deceitful and distorted campaign of misinformation . "
mo mowlam has given encouragement while michael meacher has undermined the scheme gm farmer tony marlow the welsh assembly had been battling to keep wales gm free and this latest development has been welcomed by welsh rural affairs minister carwyn jones .
plans to sow a the gm fodder maize trial crop at castle cenlas farm had also faced significant local opposition .
organic farmers in the area in particular feared they might lose their hard fought commercial advantage if customers suspected contamination .
over a 100 demonstrators concerned about cross-pollination held a protest on monday .
they are said to be jubilant at the news that the trials have been withdrawn .
a statement from contractors raymond bros and mr marlow said : " it would be unfair to proceed at this time . "
it claimed farmers had been " wrongly led to believe that the value of their commercial crops and livestock products would be put at risk by proceeding with the trial of gm maize .
" the government has woefully failed to provide , with cabinet minister mo mowlem giving every encouragement while michael meacher has done all he can to undermine the scheme , " it continued .
protestors had called on uk environment minister mr meacher to halt the trials after he questioned the location of a gm test site in warwickshire .
decision welcomed meanwhile carwyn jones said he was heartened that the views of people in pembrokeshire led to a change of heart .
the other political parties in wales all backed the postponement .
liberal democrat agriculture spokesman mick bates said the decision called into question the validity of the flintshire trial .
peaceful protestors had been planning a legal injunction against the proposed tests in pembrokeshire and had been staging fund-raising events to finance a barrister .
even though mr marlow had listened to their concerns had previously been determined to go ahead with the planting of fodder maize .

" at the end of the day , we just do not know what environmental consequences can occur from gm crops , " mr middlehurst said .
" i am urging mr cottle to rethink his decision and destroy the gm crop that he has planted . "
in a letter written to the farmer on wednesday , mr middlehurst said : " i know that this will not be an easy decision for you to take but i can assure you that a decision to stop this trial would be widely welcomed , not only in our area but indeed throughout wales . "
