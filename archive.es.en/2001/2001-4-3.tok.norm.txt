most buses and trucks stayed off the roads , two stock exchanges were closed and the port of chittagong was severely disrupted .
airport officials said hundreds of people returning from the hajj pilgrimage to mecca were stranded for up to 12 hours in the capital , dhaka , because of a shortage of transport .
the three-day strike , called to try to force prime minister sheikh hasina to call early elections , began on sunday and is due to end on tuesday evening .
general elections are due in july and the prime minister 's awami league party has vowed to serve out its full term .
security was tightened after at least one person was killed and more than 200 injured in clashes with police and in a series of bomb blasts preceding the strike .
opposition threat last month , the four-party opposition alliance - which includes opposition leader begum khaleda zia 's bangladesh national party - gave sheikh hasina an ultimatum to step down or face protests .
the prime minister had earlier announced she would step down after 17 april and hand over power to a caretaker administration , but has since changed her mind .
" we have changed our plan to hold early polls after the opposition issued the ultimatum , " she told a rally of her supporters in dhaka on saturday .
" we ca n't bow to its illogical threat . "
under the country 's constitution , the prime minister has to hand over power to an interim administration ahead of elections .
but sheikh hasina 's five-year term does not end before mid-july .
the stand-off has led to fears of more violence before the elections and has also hurt the country 's economy .
business leaders say the strikes have cost bangladesh billions of dollars in lost production and exports .

the times newspaper says orange is expected to begin a phased increase on tuesday , pushing the cheapest offer from £ 49.99 to £ 69.99 .
bt cellnet is expected to follow on wednesday .
the moves come ahead of the publication of the quarterly subscriber numbers that will see bt cellnet fighting to retain its number two position in the mobiles market .
market leader bt cellnet is expected to announce about 10.84 million customers after adding 600,000 in the quarter .
vodafone , the market leader , is believed to have attracted about 700,000 new subscribers , taking it to 12.36 million .
last week vodafone increased the price of its basic pay-as-you-go mobile phone by about 40 % .
the price of its cheapest pay as you talk handset - before dealer subsidies and special offers - will rise to £ 70 from about £ 50 from 1 may .
the company is also scrapping its " all in one " package , which includes a year 's contract line rental and bundled monthly minutes .
its decision follows a similar move by deutsche telekom-owned one2one in march , as the mobile giants try to take the heat out of the battle for new customers .

they follows research which showed a higher than expected percentage of handsets were not in regular use .
" these changes in vodafone uk 's commercial policies reflect the move of the uk market into a phase of greater maturity and our recognition of the need to reduce the current levels of expenditure on customer acquisition , " said peter bamford , chief executive of vodafone uk , middle east and africa region .

the fastest growth in customer numbers has been in pre-pay deals which bring in about one quarter the amount of money as contract customers .
all the big telecoms firms have seen their share prices plummet in the past year because of the huge amounts they have had to invest in next generation services and doubts about their ability to make enough profit from customers .
however , virgin mobile ruled out any increase in the cost of its pre-paid deals .
a spokesman said the company already kept handset subsidies to a minimum .
" we do subsidise handsets by a small amount but nowhere near as much as the other operators .
" we have always charged a realistic price for our handsets . "
as a relatively new entrant into the market , virgin was still concerned with customer acquisition , he added .
concerted effort some analysts argue that the change from customer acquisition to retention by the big four is long overdue .
" getting customers is easy - it is like turning on a tap .
" i think there is a concerted effort from the operators to make sure the customers they have got are worth it , " a telecoms analyst with a leading investment bank told bbc news online .

a survey of 300 businesses found that just 4 % of firms had sought legal advice when setting up a web site and many were breaking provisions in the data protection act .
and almost half those polled for the london chamber of commerce had no policy for staff use of e-mails .
" many firms could be in for a nasty shock by failing to give themselves adequate legal protection when doing e-business , " said the london chamber 's acting chief executive peter bishop .
" firms must act quickly to ensure they are complying with the law and are protected from the improper use of the internet by their own staff . "
web retailers were criticised by the office of fair trading last month for ignoring customers ' rights .

he will hear at first hand the worries that farmers have about the way the welsh assembly and his government is handling the crisis .
crisis in wales total confirmed cases uk-wide 943 - with 54 in wales powys - 33 cases anglesey - 13 cases monmouthshire - eight cases agriculture minister carwyn jones will take him to visit the assembly 's disease control centre in cathays park in cardiff , where he will meet first minister rhodri morgan , welsh secretary paul murphy and an army co-ordinater .
meanwhile , opposition leader william hague , will be the other side of the border , in gloucestershire , calling on mr blair to give the army full operational control to relieve the " hopelessly overstretched " ministry of agriculture .
mr blair 's visit comes as communities across wales become increasingly uneasy about arrangements for the slaughter and disposal of animals affected by the epidemic .
there have been angry scenes in rural areas where sites have been chosen for the burning or burial of bodies .
a 27-year-old man is due to appear in court at ystradgynlais in the swansea valley on tuesday charged with the attempted murder of a police officer injured during a foot-and-mouth protest .
he was charged following an incident at the weekend at llywel near sennybridge , mid wales , in which a 50-tonne bulldozer crushed a police van driven by pc john stone .
the south wales police officer had been on duty as local people protested against the burial of sheep carcasses at the nearby epynt army range .
rescuers spent an hour cutting pc stone from the wreckage .
he is said to be in a comfortable condition in hospital .
three other people were questioned and released on police bail in connection with the incident .
they had been arrested on suspicion of theft of the machine and conspiracy to cause criminal damage with intent to endanger life .
two more men were arrested on monday in connection with the incident .
police are now controlling all vehicle movements in and out of the area .
locals were so upset by the incident that they called off their protest , but more than 400 are expected to reinstate their peaceful demonstration on tuesday .
they have said they are still furious that maff and the assembly plan to bring the bodies of infected livestock to their area - so far clear of foot-and-mouth .
referred to police the environment agency confirmed on monday that it had received an anonymous threat to dump animal carcasses into reservoirs if the epynt disposal operation goes ahead .
the matter has been referred to the police .
elsewhere , 20 farmers mounted a protest outside an abbatoir at st asaph in denbighshire , north wales , on monday .
they claimed to have stopped two lorries carrying sheep from aberdeenshire , and said they were extremely concerned that the lorries passed through infected areas in dumfries and galloway and cumbria .
farmers in merthyr tydfil , south wales , took similar action at the trecatti landfill site , but were later told that no bodies would be dumped there .
agriculture minister carwyn jones confirmed the site had been earmarked by the intervention board , but he confirmed that no animals would be buried there .
in montgomery , a farmer is blockading the entrance to his farm and preventing maff officials from reaching animals earmarked for culling .
on anglesey the culling of 40,000 sheep has continued .
it is almost certain that 40,000 sheep will be disposed of at the penhesgyn landfill site , despite local opposition .

a report from the council of europe 's racism commission says that a " xenophobic " attitude is evident in the media , political debate and government policy .
there 's a certain resentment in the population -lsb- against asylum seekers -rsb- eva smith-asmussen tuesday 's report also details continuing problems in austria , albania , macedonia and denmark .
but it found that intolerance of refugees and asylum seekers was " particularly acute " in the uk .
the report said this was " reflected in the xenophobic and intolerant coverage of these groups of persons in the media " .
but it also criticised the " tone of the discourse resorted to by politicians in support of the adoption and enforcement of increasingly restrictive asylum and immigration laws " .
' misleading ' home office minister barbara roche said the report contained a series of " very serious factual inaccuracies " .
" for example it claims discriminating behaviour by immigration officials at borders yet of the 89m passenger arrivals in the uk last year there were only 40 complaints of racial discrimination against the service and one was upheld , " she said .
eva smith-asmussen , who was one of the research team behind the report and is herself danish , insisted there were inherent problems in the uk such as racist chanting at football matches .
" there 's a certain resentment in the population -lsb- against asylum seekers -rsb- and this is being boosted by certain media and certain politicians , " she told the bbc .
however , she said that the aim of the report was to help and not criticise .
the council of europe praises britain for making progress in tackling some forms of racism but warns that the uk 's anti-racist laws are not always effective .
earlier this year , home secretary jack straw called for an eu-wide agenda of action to stem the rising level of asylum seekers arriving in europe .
mr straw outlined possible changes including forming a list of " safe " countries from which applications would be refused and forcing refugees to apply for asylum before they reach britain .
record asylum figures in 2000 the number of people seeking asylum in the uk reached record levels , with a total of 76,040 individual applications .
the real number of people arriving in the country is likely to be much higher , as many have dependents and others enter illegally .
but home office figures show that the number of people claiming asylum in february was the lowest monthly total for almost two years .
the 5,520 applications were down 13 % on january 's figure - the lowest since may 1999 - with the backlog of outstanding claims almost at a seven-year low .
