hamid karzai , an ethnic pashtun , told the bbc that former taleban figures could play a role in a future government if the afghan people wanted them , but that " foreign terrorists " must be expelled and tried .
" foreign terrorists that have made afghanistan their base have brought unbelievable suffering to our people and my country .
" they must leave afghanistan and be taken to justice , " he said when asked about osama bin laden , who is accused of masterminding the 11 september attacks on the united states .
delegates from four afghan factions agreed on wednesday to set up a transitional government headed by mr karzai after 20 years of war .

he was talking by satellite phone from north of the southern afghan city of kandahar , where his forces are battling the taleban for control .
he said he believed taleban leaders would " transfer power to local tribal chiefs and local clergy ... sooner rather than later " .
the afghan islamic press - a pakistan-based agency close to the taleban - reported that taleban representatives had held talks with mr karzai about the possible handover of kandahar .
neither the taleban nor mr karzai have confirmed the report .
the power-sharing council mr karzai is to lead will take office on 22 december .

two women are among those named .
one of them , sima samar , will be one of mr karzai 's five vice-chairs .
the un has said the new authority must guarantee freedom of expression and women 's rights .
king 's role the agreement includes plans to set up a special commission to convene a loya jirga , or traditional grand assembly , to be opened by former king zahir shah .
the interim administration will rule for six months until this assembly is convened .
the assembly will then elect a transitional government to rule for not more than two years until elections are held .
another assembly will be set up to adopt a constitution within 18 months of the creation of the transitional authority .
peacekeepers the agreement also proposes requesting a multinational peacekeeping force for kabul , but does not stipulate the force 's size or duration .
the force could be progressively expanded to cover urban centres and other areas as appropriate , the text of the agreement says .
the conclusion of the talks is a big fillip for a gathering of major international aid donors taking place in berlin .
big donor countries kept up pressure on the afghan factions by warning them that billions of dollars in reconstruction aid depended on a deal being reached .

it could be a couple of years tunnelling before we get to the coal .
" we are getting our own geologists to look at the wentedge area and the faults , but they can only use the surveys that uk coal has produced .

the company has spent £ 18m over the past two years on the wentedge project , with 5,000 metres of tunnel driven to reach the reserves .
uk coal director of deep mines , alec galloway , said : " our assessment is that if we continue mining in that area , the colliery will sustain annual losses in the order of £ 15m a year .
" this is a financial burden we can not contemplate .
' business viability ' " this is poor reward for a great deal of hard work and endeavour by everyone concerned at prince of wales . "
he said due to the geological and economic position the company was " reviewing its mining operations at the colliery " .

the company said that the six months to october produced a pretax profit of £ 75.1m before one-off charges , down from £ 91.8m in the same period the year before .
it was the weakness in the us market following 11 september which did the most damage to the company 's finances , it said .
the coach usa long-distance bus operation saw operating profits drop $ 18m in september and october , with sales down $ 25m .
stagecoach said it will cut staff by 10 % or 550 jobs - including coach usa 's chief executive , randy west - mothball 330 coaches and close down a number of businesses .
that should reduce costs by $ 25m , it said .
the cost-cutting measures encouraged investors , who lifted stagecoach stock by 8.3 % to 71.5p at 1140m gmt in london .
off the rails the disruption of the uk rail network as a result of the hatfield rail crash and railtrack 's problems also harmed performance , the company said .
while sales crept up £ 6m to £ 206m , operating profits on the railways were down nearly a sixth to £ 20.8m from £ 24.3m.
stagecoach owns 49 % of virgin rail , which runs the west coast main line and cross country franchises .
it is also negotiating for a new 20-year franchise on its existing south west trains operation .
" each of our divisions is operating against the background of a challenging economic environment , " said chief executive keith cochrane .
just when coach usa might fully recover was impossible to determine , he said , while the uncertainties shrouding the uk rail network would not be settled for some time .
taking charge even so , stagecoach is pushing for the chance to run its own railway track and maintenance operation as the government tries to clean up after the forced collapse of railtrack .
" we believe this is a railwayman 's solution to the problems of our railways " which would address decades of under-funding and weak management of the track " , said chairman brian souter .

off the rails the disruption of the uk rail network as a result of the hatfield rail crash and railtrack 's problems also harmed performance , the company said .
while sales crept up £ 6m to £ 206m , operating profits on the railways were down nearly a sixth to £ 20.8m from £ 24.3m.
stagecoach owns 49 % of virgin rail , which runs the west coast main line and cross country franchises .
it is also negotiating for a new 20-year franchise on its existing south west trains operation .
" each of our divisions is operating against the background of a challenging economic environment , " said chief executive keith cochrane .
just when coach usa might fully recover was impossible to determine , he said , while the uncertainties shrouding the uk rail network would not be settled for some time .
taking charge even so , stagecoach is pushing for the chance to run its own railway track and maintenance operation as the government tries to clean up after the forced collapse of railtrack .
" we believe this is a railwayman 's solution to the problems of our railways " which would address decades of under-funding and weak management of the track " , said chairman brian souter .

the group said its businesses are still resilient despite the pounding they have taken , although sales at its hotel operations in october dropped $ 30m from the previous year .
overall , six continents said it made a pretax profit of £ 731m -lrb- $ 1.03bn -rrb- before one-off costs in the year to september , down from £ 756m the year before but ahead of forecasts of £ 710-725m .
sales rose nearly 7 % to £ 4.03bn six continents operates 3,200 hotels across almost 100 countries and 2,000 restuarants and bars in germany and the uk .
pub popularity the hotel business - which includes the inter-continental , holiday inn and crowne plaza brands - has suffered in the wake of 11 september attacks .
but the pubs and drinks business is still going strong , and helped offset the decline in tourism .
the group 's uk pubs and restaurants , such as the all bar one chain , o 'neills and harvester , saw sales rise 8.6 % in the first eight weeks of the new financial year .
and the britvic soft drinks business saw volumes rise more than 4 % , after seeing profits soar 23 % in the year to september .

in many ways , companies producing semiconductors - the electronic components that underpinned the growth of the internet in the first place - have had an equally traumatic time of it .
since a single personal computer or mobile phone can contain several hundred semiconductors , or memory chips , these firms were hit hard when companies and consumers alike began to rein in spending on it and communications equipment 18 months ago .
the us-based semiconductor industry association said this week that global memory chip sales for october 2001 plunged to $ 10.4bn -lrb- 11.4bn euros ; £ 7bn -rrb- , a massive 43 % lower than the previous year .
profits plunge and , as recent corporate results confirm , many leading chipmakers are facing their most serious crisis ever .
us semiconductor giant intel , the world 's biggest producer of computer-grade chips , saw its profits fall by a thumping 77 % during the july to september period , while its share price has slumped by two thirds since the beginning of the year .
in asia , the world 's fastest growing semiconductor market during the boom years of the late 1990s , the situation is no better .
intel is the world 's biggest chipmaker the continent 's leading chipmaker , south korea 's samsung , reported a 75 % decline in profits between july and september , while toshiba , nec , and taiwan semiconductor racked up losses in excess of $ 1bn between them over the same period .
the semiconductor downturn is so severe that south korea 's hynix and micron technology of the us are even discussing a merger , a rare event in an industry dominated by multi-billion dollar giants .
boom to bust but the severity of the slump in computer chips can not solely be attributed to slowing growth in demand for mobile phones and computers .
the latest downturn has been exacerbated by some of the semiconductor industry 's own peculiarities .
computer chips are manufactured in vast sterile fabrication units , or fabs , which take two years and cost between $ 1bn and $ 2.5bn to build .
this limits the speed with which manufacturers can respond to a decline in demand for chips from end-users .
moreover , the massive cost of re-sterilising a semiconductor plant usually makes it uneconomical to suspend production once a fab has come into service .
this means that cyclical overproduction and severe price fluctuations are a fact of life in the chip industry .
mobiles drive chip demand when demand dips , most chipmakers have little choice but to continue producing at full capacity , accepting whatever price they can get for their products .
indeed , the recent slump in sales is due more to a collapse in average semiconductor prices rather than to a decline in volumes sold .
according to industry sources , computer-grade dram -lrb- dynamic random access memory -rrb- chips now fetch less than $ 3 at the factory gate , down from around $ 50 in 1996 .
let the good times roll however , the big semiconductor producers are well aware that their industry is cyclical , and have various strategies for coping with downturns .
most make sure that they can weather the slowdowns by maximising profits and paying off debts during the upswings .
and already , many leading analysts say that the spread of new generation mobile phone technology is poised to trigger the start of a new cycle .
technology market monitors gartner last month forecast that demand for computer chips will enter the expansionary phase of the next cycle by 2003 , hitting growth rates of 30 % a year .
and market leader intel this week announced that it hit sales targets in november thanks to unexpectedly strong demand for its innovative pentium 4 chips , sparking a rally in technology stocks . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's martin lewis " for most people this is the last chance .. for a bargain " profits plunge in 2001 intel profits slide yahoo losses linger microsoft concerns motorola slashes jobs infineon chip slump dell 's price war ericsson shock unisys profits halve sony 's heavy losses fujitsu slides into red compaq losses mount nokia sales fall ibm rare success ad slump hits aol bruised apple philips ' hefty losses palm sales halved lucent losses widen cisco slumps analysis mobile phone saturation global pc downturn battle of the handhelds bill gates talks it up silicon valley survival marconi 's wrong turning stock option revival consolidation hopes few signs of recovery see also : 29 oct 01 -pipe- business samsung plans chip dominance 22 oct 01 -pipe- business profits dive at chipmaker samsung 16 mar 01 -pipe- asia-pacific samsung folds in uzbekistan 04 dec 01 -pipe- business chip merger grows closer 13 nov 01 -pipe- business chip slump batters infineon 31 oct 01 -pipe- business intel predicts sharp growth 26 oct 01 -pipe- business chips hit by sharp losses internet links : hynix semiconductor gartner taiwan semiconductor intel the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : worldcom chiefs refuse to testify buoyant ebay snaps up bills firm digital tv woes hit pace profits bush vows action after scandals merck ' exaggerated ' revenue in accounts congress pushes accounting reform oil trade thaws us-russian ties hiv : the drug firms ' quest for a cure links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

this limits the speed with which manufacturers can respond to a decline in demand for chips from end-users .
moreover , the massive cost of re-sterilising a semiconductor plant usually makes it uneconomical to suspend production once a fab has come into service .
this means that cyclical overproduction and severe price fluctuations are a fact of life in the chip industry .
when demand dips , most chipmakers have little choice but to continue producing at full capacity , accepting whatever price they can get for their products .
indeed , the recent slump in sales is due more to a collapse in average semiconductor prices rather than to a decline in volumes sold .
according to industry sources , computer-grade dram -lrb- dynamic random access memory -rrb- chips now fetch less than $ 3 at the factory gate , down from around $ 50 in 1996 .
let the good times roll however , the big semiconductor producers are well aware that their industry is cyclical , and have various strategies for coping with downturns .
most make sure that they can weather the slowdowns by maximising profits and paying off debts during the upswings .
and already , many leading analysts say that the spread of new generation mobile phone technology is poised to trigger the start of a new cycle .
technology market monitors gartner last month forecast that demand for computer chips will enter the expansionary phase of the next cycle by 2003 , hitting growth rates of 30 % a year .
and market leader intel this week announced that it hit sales targets in november thanks to unexpectedly strong demand for its innovative pentium 4 chips , sparking a rally in technology stocks .
