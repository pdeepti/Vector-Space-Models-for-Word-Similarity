the daily telegraph says the country 's biggest city has choked under a cloud of bushfire smoke and has a picture to prove it .
it shows the sydney harbour bridge barely visible at noon on sunday , which could disrupt monday 's new year 's eve celebrations .
" sydney fades to grey , " said one columnist , as pollution levels hit an all-time high .
" spared by luck and toil " is the headline in the australian , which reports that mild , freakish weather coupled with extensive containment efforts by the army of emergency workers spared much of the sydney region from an inferno .
the sydney morning herald 's editorial gives mention to what it calls the great australian spirit , which has shone through the smoky haze of the crisis like a beacon .
the paper praises the sacrifices made by the many thousands of volunteer fire fighters , the largest emergency force ever assembled here .
anger at arsonists if these fires that have devastated a quarter of a million hectares of bush land have brought out the best in many people , they have also brought out the worst in others .
the authorities believe almost half of the outbreaks across much of new south wales were started deliberately .
all of the newspapers reflect the anger and disbelief felt here towards the arsonists .
" acts of sheer bastardry " says the sydney morning herald , quoting the state 's second most senior police officer , who leads a specialist squad set up to track down the firebugs .
comments from the premier of new south wales , bob carr , get aired in every newspaper .
he said simply the arsonists " were mad and wicked " and promised to do all he could to increase the penalties for those convicted .
new warning australia 's wild summer weather dominates other papers around the country .
brisbane 's courier mail reports that queensland 's summer heatwave has abruptly given way to violent electrical storms , which damaged dozens of homes and caused many others to go without power .
the herald sun in melbourne describes the country-wide effort that is battling the flames further north near sydney .
fire crews from victoria , south australia and queensland are all on the front line , along with army and navy personnel .
the paper strikes an ominous warning for the days ahead .
it says hot , dry conditions are expected for the next 72 hours , providing the fire stricken areas no respite .
in its end-of-year review the australian reflects that the country sees out 2001 focusing on a familiar threat .
bush fires are common but the intensity of these fires is not .
the newspaper believes the nation should harness the sense of purpose and togetherness the fires have brought to create a more optimistic and outward looking country in 2002 .
