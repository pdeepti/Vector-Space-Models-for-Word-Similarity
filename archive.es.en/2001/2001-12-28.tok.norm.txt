" we will be unrelenting in our pursuit of anybody who has caused these acts of arson , " said commander laycock .

the nsw emergency services ministry has declined to hire an ilyushin-76 fire-fighting plane , which can drop more than 40,000 litres -lrb- 10,400 gallons -rrb- of water in eight seconds .

japan 's army of unemployed is mounting the november jobless rate , at 5.5 % , was the highest since records began in the 1950s , up from 5.4 % in october and 5.3 % in september .
output in japan has fallen to its lowest level for 14 years and thousands of manufacturing and construction jobs have vanished during japan 's more than three recessions in 10 years .
end of an era that spells the end of a central icon of japan 's postwar economic miracle : the jobs for life principle .
in former years , many men - gender equality in the workplace is still a dream in much of corporate japan - would join a corporation fresh out of college , staying until retirement in their mid-50s .
pay rises came largely with seniority .
so as belts are tightened , it is these men , between the ages of 45 and 55 , who are bearing the brunt of layoffs , and who have little hope of finding another job .
according to the public management ministry , the number of 45-54-year-old men without jobs was up 130,000 year on year to a record 440,000 .
and the number of unemployed heads of households rose 180,000 to 1.01m.
export panacea off the cards traditionally , japan has managed to pull out of recession by relying on exports .
this time , that is proving difficult after the aftermaths of the 11 september attacks have caused further weakness to an already ailing world economy .
even a slump in the value of the japanese currency versus the us dollar is not expected to bring any immediate relief for the country 's growing army of unemployed .
traditional industries hit unemployment is particularly painful for men formerly employed in traditional industrial jobs and performing the roles of the traditional breadwinners of their families , the government said .
the yen is historically weak against the us dollar japan 's prime minister , junichiro koizumi , described the country 's economic problems as " very serious " and vowed to inject more state money into the country 's banks in order to prevent a complete financial meltdown , japanese newspapers reported .
the only good news to emerge in japan was a feeble deflation slowdown , from october 's 0.8 % to 0.1 % in november .
in addition , consumer spending rose 3.6 % in november from a year earlier , up from a yearly rise in october of 1.6 % .
this should help bolster the country 's economy .

the educational institute of scotland -lrb- eis -rrb- made the claim after a survey indicated that 86 % of teachers on temporary contracts are female .
more than 2,000 teachers on temporary contracts took part in the study , which also suggested that 48 % of teachers were unable to get a permanent post .
eis general secretary ronnie smith said that in light of the survey 's findings , education bosses should re-double their efforts to create more permanent teaching posts .
as part of a recent agreement on conditions of service , each education authority will be reviewing their use of temporary contracts helen law , cosla he said : " it would appear from this survey that the growing use of such contracts means that women teachers in particular are affected .
" the fact that around half of all respondents are in temporary posts due to a shortage of permanent teaching opportunities is discriminatory in that it is mostly women who are affected .
" we would urge the relevant authorities to look very closely at the reasons behind these findings and , as a matter or urgency , authorities should look at ways of ensuring more permanent posts for teachers . "
the eis sent questionnaires to more than 6,000 teachers on temporary contracts and received 2,128 replies .
of those , 1,820 were women and only 308 were men .
the scottish executive is currently in the midst of a major campaign to attract more people into the teaching profession .
' stable environment ' mr smith said this , coupled with the findings of the survey , showed that the need for more permanent teaching posts would grow in the future .
he added : " we must ensure that teachers have a stable environment in which to work for the good of education and pupils in scottish schools .
" only by ensuring that there are sufficient numbers of teachers in secure positions can we provide the right environment for learning and teaching in scotland 's schools and make teaching attractive as a career for graduates . "
more than 2,000 teachers responded to the survey but helen law , education spokeswoman for local authority umbrella group cosla , said moves were already afoot to look at the use of temporary teaching contracts .
she said : " as part of a recent agreement on conditions of service , each education authority will be reviewing their use of temporary contracts .
" high quality training is clearly important for the temporary workforce and this is why education authorities are introducing one year induction / training posts for all newly qualified teachers .
" these will provide a stable environment in which newly qualified teachers are able to work and this can only be for the good of education and scotland 's schoolchildren . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- police wooed with pay deal categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 28 december , 2001 , 06:26 gmt police wooed with pay deal it is illegal for police officers to strike the government has offered police officers in england and wales a package that includes a Â£ 400 pay rise for every officer , after talks with the police federation .
some officers could get up to Â£ 1,000 a year once they have proved their competence and some could receive as much as an additional Â£ 5,000 .
but the federation acknowledges approval of the deal could be doubtful once officers see the new conditions they will have to accept .
home secretary david blunkett has been calling for major reforms aimed at shaking up police working practices .
costly abuses he has demanded more consistent clear-up rates for crime and a reduction in what he believes have been costly abuses of sick leave and early retirement on medical grounds .
the chairman of the police federation , fred broughton , said the package would now be put to officers for their approval .
" we are going to need to widely consult with police officers about the detail ... to see what police officers are thinking about it and feeling about it , " said mr broughton .
i think there 's a package here that enables us to achieve the radical reforms we want in policing in britain john denham home office minister the police had threatened to stage demonstrations and work to rule if the reform white paper , which proposed changes to pay and conditions , was not diluted .
mr broughton added : " we 've concluded the negotiations today with the best negotiated package we could achieve in the timescale . "
" it 's a difficult package we 've been pressing hard for over many weeks and long hours tonight to try and get the compensation , the money , into the frontline officers ' pay package . "
' lazy ' home office minister john denham told the bbc : " we 've had pretty tough but basically constructive negotiations over a number of weeks now , and i think there 's a package here that enables us to achieve the radical reforms we want in policing in britain . "
he said the deal would also provide " a better and fairer pay system for police officers " .
he added that the offer meant a more a flexible working system and more efficient use of officers , which would keep more experienced staff on the frontline .
mr blunkett 's aim in his white paper was to cut down on unnecessary paperwork and increase police visibility on the streets using civilians as patrollers .
but the police federation , which has 126,000 rank and file members , had fiercely opposed the proposals , claiming they would lead to pay cuts and worse conditions .
if officers refused overtime , policing could be affected after the talks , the federation said it could not make any further progress before consulting police officers and this meant any final agreement with the government would be delayed until probably february .
there will also have to be another meeting with the government some time in the new year .
mr broughton added : " i think in this process , the government is getting what it wants in terms of modernisation .
" it 's getting some flexibility , it 's getting changes in working conditions .
' bouncers ' " and the police officers are going to get extra pay in their pay package , either by the normal pay scale or by some special allowances we 're trying very hard to be focused on the frontline . "
he attacked the home secretary for allegedly conducting private briefings portraying frontline officers as lazy malingerers who abuse the sick pay system .
but mr denham denied he or mr blunkett had made such strong criticisms , merely an effort by them to bring parity to sickness levels between forces .
denham : fair pay package police had threatened to stage a mass rally at sheffield arena in a bid to embarrass mr blunkett in his home city .
it is illegal for officers to strike , but possible action could include work to rule or refusal to carry out voluntary duties , such as carrying firearms .
further proposals to give civilian wardens the power to detain suspects " using reasonable force " raised concerns in the federation .
the wardens were dubbed " blunkett 's bouncers " . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's nicholas jones " in return for their co-operation the government has put new money on the table " police federation chairman fred broughton " it 's a difficult package we 've been pressing hard for " uk home office minister john denham mp " a better and fairer pay system for police officers " see also : 17 dec 01 -pipe- uk anger brews over police plans 17 dec 01 -pipe- uk ' low morale ' on the front line 29 nov 01 -pipe- uk politics police anger over blunkett reforms 17 dec 01 -pipe- uk politics q & a : police reform white paper 02 dec 01 -pipe- uk politics plan to reform ' failing ' police 12 jul 01 -pipe- uk politics blunkett reveals police reform plans internet links : police federation home office police reform off duty the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk stories now : postcode lottery in gp services leanne killer jailed for life tories attack brixton drugs scheme straw defends arms sales change ivf mix-up heads for court police shoot man on the m6 new challenge excites venables judge urges life sentence shake-up links to more uk stories are at the foot of the page .
