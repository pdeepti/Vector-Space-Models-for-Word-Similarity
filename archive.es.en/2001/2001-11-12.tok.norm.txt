despite similarities to the 20s silent classic , " berlin , symphony of a city " , schadt 's film is no remake . thomas schadt and his assistant have been hard at work in the germany 's capital for almost a year now .
the two are making a film on berlin .
despite schadt 's fascination for the famous berlin film classic , " berlin , symphony of a great city " , the film producer does not regard his project as a remake of the former , but as his own tribute to today 's berlin .
but schadt 's film does resemble ruttman 's silent masterpiece in certain aspects : " what we have taken from walther ruttmann 's film is the fact that we 're shooting in black and white on 35mm film , " film director thomas schadt says .
as well as the fact that he too , is recounting a day in the life of berlin .
the power of montage ruttmann did not intend to create a realistic portrait of the city in 1927 .
the power of his images comes from his clever montage technique , which conveys a sense of movement and speed .
" in terms of content , ruttmann - in a very visionary manner - came up with an image of a city in which he said : here , take a look , this is the pulse of a city , this is what a metropolis will look like .
and what i think we 're doing , what i hope the film will finally say is : take a look at this walther - this is how your vision turned out , " schadt says .
no glossy post-card clichés schadt 's film shows images that represent berlin 's recent history , such as the painted remains of the berlin wall , known as the east side gallery .
but the film also includes historical landmarks in the heart of the city .
however schadt hopes to avoid the so typical glossy picture post-card clichés of berlin .
thomas schadt is always on the look out for unusual images .
a glimpse behind the scenes and pictures of day-to-day life are both important elements in his work : whether images of people at work in a bmw factory or of the bustling atmosphere at one of the city 's many flea markets , schadt attempts to capture the life behind the surface .
half of the shots , he says , are planned but part of the film team 's intention is to put aside enough time to also react spontaneously to things that are unexpected – " real poetry " for schadt . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic picture of the day dw-tv europe live popxport - das deutsche musikmagazin we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

toy story marketed buzz lightyear dolls one bright spark tells the gang of toys how merchandisers failed to anticipate the demand for buzz lightyear dolls during the first film .
the joke neatly parodies a film that spawned a mini industry in buzz lightyear merchandise .
it also makes a serious point about how merchandising has become an integrated part of the whole film experience , says andy milligan , a director at the branding consultancy interbrand .
harry potter craze today , few could fail to notice the rush to cash in on the ubiquitous harry potter .
cashing in on harry potter many months before the harry potter film was set to launch , retailers were selling harry potter book-ends , wizard coins and quidditch card games .
and because of the universal popularity of the harry potter phenomenom , consumers seem only too happy to lap up the memorabilia .
as a result , global sales of harry potter merchandising are expected to generate the sizeable sum of £ 1.4bn next year , according to industry estimates .
fortune telling in the big league of blockbuster merchandising , similar fortunes have been made .
famously , george lucas , the creator of star wars , was said to have earned close to $ 1bn from merchandising and sequel rights to the star wars films .
george lucas made a fortune from star wars according to hollywood legend , producers 20th century fox chose to sign away the merchandising rights rather than give mr lucas a pay rise .
" he benefited from fox 's lack of belief in the value of merchandising , " says steven gaydos , executive editor of industry publication variety in london .
in the beginning ...
as mr gaydos points out , spin-offs have been around since the beginning of film .
charlie chaplin led to the sale of " little tramp " confectionary , while walt disney capitalised on the us nation 's affection for mickey mouse .
merchandising switched from useful , but not essential , to being a major contributor to the business plan andy milligan interbrand but it was not until star wars that film executives began to see the true potential of spin-off products .
" before , merchandising was seen opportunistically , as creating value , " says interbrand 's mr milligan .
" but george lucas showed how you could make a fortune . "
" it switched from useful , but not essential , to being a major contributor to the business plan . "
merchandise multiples a successful hollywood film can make about $ 120m from the box office , explains mr gaydos .
on top of that , it can generate about $ 60m from ancillary products , such as videos , dvds and pay-per-view .
strong merchandising , however , can then add another $ 50-200m , depending on how exploitable the film is .
blockbuster films that appeal to children tend to be the most obvious vehicles for merchandising .
" children are fad mad and ca n't get enough of things , " says mr milligan .
adults only however , adult films like james bond also provide opportunities for more sophisticated merchandising , such as cds of the film 's soundtrack .
ralph fiennes ' face launched a re-run of the novel the english patient in addition , there is careful placement of products in the film .
" in james bond , there are nokia phones and bmw cars .
they choose brands that sit appropriately with the james bond image , " says mr milligan .
in another example , the release of the english patient coincided with a new book run of the novel , which carried actor ralph fiennes on the front cover .
backfiring nevertheless , there is always the danger that excess merchandising will backfire .
at the beginning of last year , publisher dorling kindersley saw its profits slide after over-investing in star wars books during the release of phantom menace .
the company said it sold just three million of the 13 million books it had printed .
the unsold books caused a £ 3m loss on operations and a £ 14m write-off against the unsold stock .
" with star wars , people just assumed it was a banker , " says mr milligan .
" if you assume consumers will buy anything , you will fail . "
over-hyped in the case of another children 's film , godzilla , the flood of merchandise highlighted the failure of the film , critically .
after all the hype , the film was unable to live up to expectations , says variety 's mr gaydos .
godzilla merchandising influenced the film nevertheless , the film still managed to gross $ 350m - with considerable help from its merchandising .
the search for marketable toys and characters , such as a " good " opponent for godzilla , even influenced the development of the film .
" godzilla showed how early merchandising kicks in and how it even helped create the script , " says mr gaydos .
" it 's really unbelievable how really integrally entwined the different arms -lsb- of the film -rsb- are - the merchandising , the promotion , the production of dvds , " he adds .
what 's for xmas ?
as christmas approaches , there will be no shortage of kids clamouring for the latest harry potter must-have .
jk rowling has kept a careful eye on the merchandising unlike fox , time warner is carefully coordinating the harry potter spin-offs under the watchful eye of jk rowling .
so far the film premiere seems to have lived up to expectations and there appears to be a healthy appetite for the merchandise .
perhaps harry 's magic touch has warded off the evils of over-supply and excessive marketing .

the events - organised by the national union of students -lrb- nus -rrb- - focus on demands to restore targeted grants and to abolish tuition fees .
the government announced last month that it was reviewing student funding .
demonstrations in november 13th : nottingham , cardiff 15th : birmingham 17th : london 19th : bristol 20th : plymouth , cambridge 21st : newcastle 22nd : southampton 27th : liverpool it is looking closely at bringing back in a limited form student maintenance grants , which it abolished four years ago .
and some ministers are known to be in favour of abolishing tuition fees , which were found to be a main cause of complaint on doorsteps during the general election campaign .
as the government continues its review of student funding , the nus wants to press for a generous package for students .
the nus president , owain james , said students worked long hours in paid work to try to keep their debts down with a detrimental effect on their grades .
" and they still graduate with over £ 12,000 of debt , " he said .
" while we welcome the government 's review of student funding , we are deeply concerned about recent media speculation over alternative systems which nus believe will leave thousands of students even worse off .
" if the government is serious about fulfilling its manifesto pledge to widen access it must introduce new money into the sector at the earliest opportunity , " he said .
' scrap tuition fees ' the union wants to see the abolition of tuition fees and the introduction of targeted maintenance support for those students who do not traditionally see university as a viable option .
the first demonstration will get underway in nottingham on 13 november , when students will hold a march and rally .
on 15 november , students in birmingham will stage a parade involving eight buses through the city and hold a rally .
other events will follow in london , bristol , plymouth , cambridge , newcastle , southampton , liverpool , bangor , aberystwyth , lampeter , camarthen , swansea , glamorgan and cardiff .
one of those taking part in the nottingham demonstration will be law student claire johnson .
making ends meet in the second year of her degree at trent university , claire says she struggles to juggle her academic work with paid work she needs to make ends meet .
" i work for about ten hours a week as a course instructor for the union , teaching things like stress-busting and time-management .
" then at the weekends , i work as many hours as i can in a hotel .
" i sometimes work between 15 and 25 hours over a weekend . "
claire , who took out a £ 1,200 student loan to cover her accommodation costs this september , says she still has a big overdraft despite her paid work .
she says she needs the money to buy core books for her degree .
" the books can cost anything from £ 15 to £ 45 pounds and you really do need to buy some because they are in short supply in the library . "
the government 's review of student funding should report within five months , but it is unlikely changes could affect students before autumn 2003 .

they will have the chance to comment on the proposals before a ballot is held next year .
but opponents claim vital financial information is missing from the 60-page document , which tenants should receive on monday .
' your home , your choice ' outlines the plans to transfer the homes of about 90,000 council tenants to community ownership .
it says that if the proposals go ahead then the council 's housing debt of around £ 900m will be wiped out and massive investment can be made to modernise homes and regenerate communities .
tenants are being asked for their views by friday 14 december .
the next stage will see the holding of a ballot .
welcoming the consultation , social justice minister jackie baillie said that the transfer could deliver real and lasting benefits to tenants .
but opponents of the plans say that key financial information has been left out of the document .
details about how much will be spent locally on improving the housing stock have not been included .
opponents are considering legal action to force the council to provide this information so that tenants can be properly informed before the ballot takes place .
they have called for the council 's debt to be written off , but for the council to embark on a new programme of social housing to improve dilapidated stock .
safeguards ' in place ' in october scottish socialist leader tommy sheridan said all those involved in the stock transfer project had ignored tenants ' interests .
he claimed that rather than being involved in the process , tenants were being " financially blackmailed " .
but glasgow city council leader charlie gordon said safeguards regarding investment , rent levels and security of tenure were mostly in place .
and he said tenants would have the final say on whether to agree to the stock transfer .

macedonian state television reported that the officers died near the village of trebos , near tetovo , after an operation to take control of an alleged mass grave .
officials quoted by reuters news agency say the officers died when they came under a rocket attack .
shooting has also been reported in other villages around the town of tetovo .
the bbc 's nicholas wood in pristina says the violence is the most serious incident in the country since early august , when ethnic albanian and macedonian politicians signed a peace deal designed to end seven months of conflict .
the deaths followed the deployment of an elite police unit in the region by macedonia 's interior minister , ljube boskovski , a fierce opponent of the peace process .
the macedonian cabinet met on sunday night to discuss the crisis , as mr boskovski warned that " macedonia has been attacked one more time and we have to fight back fiercely " .
albanians arrested interior ministry officials said the police officers ' task was to seize control of the alleged mass grave and arrest former ethnic albanian guerrillas .
it is believed the grave is that of 12 macedonians killed by ethnic albanians during the recent conflict .
local reports say seven ethnic albanians were arrested in spite of an amnesty declared by the macedonian government for members of the guerrilla army .
hours later , police say 12 ethnic macedonians were taken hostage , although three - two women and a young girl - were later released .
but macedonian television reported that dozens of macedonian civilians were held hostage by ethnic albanians in the village of semsovo near trebos in protest at the police operation .
the macedonian information agency says president boris trajkovski has appealed for the release of the hostages .
the violence erupted just as macedonia 's parliament was expected to ratify the august peace deal after three months of debate .
the session set for monday was cancelled due to the latest escalation .
peace process delayed the ethnic albanian insurrection began in february but guerrillas voluntarily disarmed in a nato-led operation after a peace deal was struck in august .
a former rebel commander , speaking on condition of anonymity to the associated press , said that the disbanded group , the national liberation army , was not involved in the hostage-taking incidents .
nato spokesman craig ratcliff said : " we are monitoring the situation .
the international community is very concerned about this , but for now it 's an internal issue . "

but macedonian television reported that dozens of macedonian civilians were held hostage by ethnic albanians in the village of semsovo near trebos in protest at the police operation .
the macedonian information agency says president boris trajkovski has appealed for the release of the hostages .
the violence erupted just as macedonia 's parliament was expected to ratify the august peace deal after three months of debate .
the session set for monday was cancelled due to the latest escalation .
peace process delayed the ethnic albanian insurrection began in february but guerrillas voluntarily disarmed in a nato-led operation after a peace deal was struck in august .
a former rebel commander , speaking on condition of anonymity to the associated press , said that the disbanded group , the national liberation army , was not involved in the hostage-taking incidents .
nato spokesman craig ratcliff said : " we are monitoring the situation .

she had sounded out possible supporters and indicated her interest .
however , ms alexander surprised many pundits by announcing on sunday that she would not be standing .
in a statement , she said : " after much heart-searching i have decided it would not be right for me to put my name forward . "
jack mcconnell appears to be the favourite she said she would find it difficult to step into the role previously held by the late donald dewar , with whom she had worked closely .
" labour is the only way forward for scotland and whoever becomes first minister will have my support , " she added .
one of her supporters said on sunday that her decision was understandable but deeply disappointing .
ms alexander was formerly a special adviser to mr dewar and close friends say she saw at first hand the damaging impact of the top job on the late first minister .
her supporters say it is a purely personal decision - and not any reflection of her likely prospects .
nominations open the favourite to win the labour leadership contest , education minister jack mcconnell , is already canvassing votes - although he has not yet declared his candidacy .
deputy health minister malcolm chisholm has confirmed he will stand as a unity candidate .
nominations in the contest to succeed mr mcleish open on monday morning .
after hustings meetings and a ballot of the membership , the winner will be declared early next month .
malcom chisholm : unity candidate the new leader will go before the scottish parliament on thursday 6 december to be endorsed as first minister .
in total 412,000 ballot papers will be sent out and there will be three official hustings meetings .
it would normally take the party three months to elect a new scottish leader but the scotland act requires that a new first minister be in place within 28 days .
in the vote 356,000 trade unionists will make their choice , alongside 25,000 party members .
fifty-five msps , 56 mps and four meps complete those who will vote in the electoral college . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's brian taylor in glasgow " it still looks like being a two horse race but with different horses " internet links : scottish labour scottish parliament scottish executive house of commons scottish conservative party scottish national party scottish liberal democrats the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top mcleish resignation stories now : mcleish to rebuild political career deacon lifts lid on resignation jack suffers first defeat tory trumps first minister 's choice labour rejects cronyism taunts mcconnell in radical cabinet shake-up ' jack the knife ' under fire who 's who in the scottish cabinet links to more mcleish resignation stories are at the foot of the page .

karl rove , the president 's political advisor , met with the executives in beverly hills to discuss the change in the political climate in the wake of the terror attacks .
we talked about no propaganda - the industry decides what it will do and when it will do it bush advisor karl rove " content was off the table , " said jack valenti , president of the motion picture association of america .
" directors , writers , producers , studios will determine the kind of pictures they choose to make and the compelling stories they want to tell , " he said .
a lot to offer forty-seven representatives attended from most of hollywood 's major studios , including cbs , sony , viacom , dreamworks and mgm .
mr rove said the studio chiefs had a lot to offer .
" these people , like every other american , feel strongly about the events of 11 september and the need to see this war through to its victorious conclusion , " he said .
mr rove said that on the agenda in the two-hour meeting were volunteerism , support for us troops and their families , and showing that the war in afghanistan was not against islam but against terrorism .
ideas were also raised like putting on shows to entertain troops , getting new movies overseas quickly for soldiers and sailors and producing tv public service announcements to reassure children and families .
' not propaganda ' mr rove emphasised that the government was not asking hollywood to produce propaganda .
" the world is full of people who are discerning and we need to recognise that concrete information told with honesty , specificity and integrity is important to the ultimate success of this conflict , " mr rove said .
mr valenti said the studios could produce public service announcements for the local and overseas audiences .
" we can try to tell people how america has been the most generous country in the world , we have fed and clothed and sheltered millions of people without asking anything in return , " mr valenti said .
he said paramount had sponsored the meeting , which also included trade union leaders .
pr battle the meeting is being seen as an attempt by the government to win the public relations battle as it continues its bombing campaign against afghanistan and clean-up operations in new york and washington .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said the meeting was not about influencing plot lines for films .
" the white house will share with the entertainment community the themes that are being communicated here and abroad : tolerance , courage , patriotism , " he said .
an executive quoted in daily variety likened the gathering to one that followed the japanese attack on pearl harbor .
that led to the major hollywood studios producing more patriotic , morale-boosting films .
public service announcements have previously been used to warn children of the perils of drugs and to promote literacy .
hollywood is just one of the industries that has been affected by the 11 september attacks .
in the immediate aftermath , films with violent or contentious themes were shelved , including arnold schwarzenegger 's collateral damage , and an episode from friends set in an airport .

karl rove , the president 's political advisor , met with the executives in beverly hills to discuss the change in the political climate in the wake of the terror attacks .
we talked about no propaganda - the industry decides what it will do and when it will do it bush advisor karl rove " content was off the table , " said jack valenti , president of the motion picture association of america .
" directors , writers , producers , studios will determine the kind of pictures they choose to make and the compelling stories they want to tell , " he said .
a lot to offer forty-seven representatives attended from most of hollywood 's major studios , including cbs , sony , viacom , dreamworks and mgm .
mr rove said the studio chiefs had a lot to offer .
" these people , like every other american , feel strongly about the events of 11 september and the need to see this war through to its victorious conclusion , " he said .
mr rove said that on the agenda in the two-hour meeting were volunteerism , support for us troops and their families , and showing that the war in afghanistan was not against islam but against terrorism .
ideas were also raised like putting on shows to entertain troops , getting new movies overseas quickly for soldiers and sailors and producing tv public service announcements to reassure children and families .
' not propaganda ' mr rove emphasised that the government was not asking hollywood to produce propaganda .
" the world is full of people who are discerning and we need to recognise that concrete information told with honesty , specificity and integrity is important to the ultimate success of this conflict , " mr rove said .
mr valenti said the studios could produce public service announcements for the local and overseas audiences .
" we can try to tell people how america has been the most generous country in the world , we have fed and clothed and sheltered millions of people without asking anything in return , " mr valenti said .
he said paramount had sponsored the meeting , which also included trade union leaders .
pr battle the meeting is being seen as an attempt by the government to win the public relations battle as it continues its bombing campaign against afghanistan and clean-up operations in new york and washington .
a plan to repaint the hollywood sign red , white and blue was rejected white house spokesman ari fleischer said the meeting was not about influencing plot lines for films .
" the white house will share with the entertainment community the themes that are being communicated here and abroad : tolerance , courage , patriotism , " he said .
an executive quoted in daily variety likened the gathering to one that followed the japanese attack on pearl harbor .
that led to the major hollywood studios producing more patriotic , morale-boosting films .
public service announcements have previously been used to warn children of the perils of drugs and to promote literacy .
hollywood is just one of the industries that has been affected by the 11 september attacks .
in the immediate aftermath , films with violent or contentious themes were shelved , including arnold schwarzenegger 's collateral damage , and an episode from friends set in an airport .
