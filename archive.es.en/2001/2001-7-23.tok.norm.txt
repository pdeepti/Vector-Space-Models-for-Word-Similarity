officials from the world 's 49 poorest countries have started talks in zanzibar to try to shape any further liberalisation in the world trade organisation in their own interests .
they are concerned that they are being forced to open up their markets while the west is not opening up to them .
they will consider a proposal that they should not enter new rounds of trade negotiations until the commitments made by the developed world to them in the past are honoured .
tanzania 's trade minister , idi simba , told the bbc that europe and the us subsidise their agricultural sectors , while lecturing poor countries not to do the same .
" we know we are not getting a fair deal , " he said , pointing out that europe had previously promised to reduce its agricultural subsidies by 2000 .
agriculture is the biggest employer and earner in many african countries and economists say that exporting food could be one of the fastest ways to boost living standards .
broken rules the world 's poorest 49 countries account for less than 1 % of world exports and they think the developed world should be able to afford their demands .
" we are confronting a time where 600 million people , one-tenth of the population of this globe , are finding it increasingly difficult in their endeavor to lead a decent life , " said s rahama , the chief delegate from bangladesh .
after talks stalled in seattle in 1999 , the wto is meeting again this november in doha , qatar .
in a draft declaration to be signed on tuesday , the countries ' finance ministers are expected to express concern " at the exclusion and marginalization " caused by current wto rules .
none of the poor countries has been able to accede to the wto since its establishment in 1995 , and the poor nations ' percentage of world trade has dropped .
the least developed countries are defined by the un as countries with an average per capita income of less than $ 900 a year .
haiti is the only country in this category in the western hemisphere .
there are also a number of pacific islands represented but apart from bangladesh , the poorest countries with the largest populations are all in africa .
following the riots in genoa and the last wto meeting in seattle , the meeting 's spokesman , hassan mitawi , told the french news agency afp : " we do n't expect any protestors here ... but we are not going to take things easily . "

security was tight as mourners , many clad in black or wearing black armbands , streamed into may pen cemetery , one of kingston 's largest burial grounds .
i am filled with sorrow for all these people that are here , dead , through no fault of their own edward seaga , jamaica labour party the 13 victims - all civilians , aged from 15 to 83 - were lowered into a long single , grave .
at least 28 people , including four policemen and soldiers , died during gun battles that began on 7 july in gang strongholds of west kingston .
prime minister pj patterson called out the army two days later to help restore order .
the services passed off peacefully , with relatives singing hymns and weeping in front of coffins laden with flowers .
occasionally though , a mourner shouted angrily , vowing revenge against the government and police .
' sorrow ' may pen cemetery is close to the tivoli gardens and denham town districts of the city , where the worst of the violence erupted .
opposition jamaica labour party leader edward seaga told mourners : " i am filled with sorrow for all these people that are here , dead , through no fault of their own . "
mr seaga , a former prime minister now in the opposition , accused security forces of firing indiscriminately on the streets of tivoli gardens , a jlp stronghold , to foment unrest for political reasons .
the prime minister has said gunmen opened fire on police during a weapons sweep through the inner city areas , where gangs linked to the two major political parties operate .
however , some people have claimed that they came under random police sniper fire during the fighting , and there have been accusations from civil rights groups that the police overreacted .
rival communities jamaica 's two major political parties , mr patterson 's people 's national party and seaga 's jlp , armed political supporters in kingston 's inner cities during the 1970s to secure influence and votes in poor districts .
these ' garrison ' communities , as they are called , remain fiercely loyal to the rival parties .
as a result , jamaica has suffered frequent outbursts of inner-city violence in the months before national elections .
more than 500 people were killed before 1980 elections and dozens more died before national votes in 1993 and 1997 .

the talks are trying to thrash out the details for implementing the pollution-reduction commitments made at kyoto - notably a 5.2 % reduction in global emissions of six greenhouse gases by 2012 , relative to 1990 levels .
the latest paper includes generous allowances for the use of forests and farmland to reduce the amount by which countries have to cut emissions .
in return they would have to give up the right to use investment in nuclear power as an alternative to cutting greenhouse gases .
the compromise plan would in fact cut greenhouse gases by less than half the amount set in the kyoto protocol , but many delegations think it better to accept a poor deal now than any of the worse ones they think will be available later .

the treasury and the bank of england should start planning a large-scale currency intervention prof peter spencer the ernst & young 's item club is calling for the pound to be deliberately weakened .
it says that the bank of england should intervene in the currency markets to sell the pound and buy the euro , bridging the chasm between the two .
the bleak warning - made in the item club 's quarterly report - goes on to say that the high street and the housing market will follow the manufacturing sector into recession .
it adds that the economy wo n't pick up until 2003 .
the item club has broken with convention in trying to influence the bank of england , rather than just forecasting the state of the economy .
precarious situation " the present situation is so precarious that we have to come out and say something has got to be done , " said the item club 's professor peter spencer .
the strength of the pound against the euro has meant that british manufacturers are struggling to compete in europe .
unless the pound falls soon you are going to see bodies falling out of the window in a big way prof peter spencer the downturn in the manufacturing sector will next hit the level of employment and this in turn will knock down consumer sentiment and the housing market .

in a second increase , italenergia upped its bid price from 3.07 euros a share to 3.16 euros a share .
the final price represents a 30 % premium to the 12-month average of montedison 's share price and is worth about 5.5bn euros -lrb- $ 4.8bn -rrb- .
montedison 's shares bounced up close to 3.16 euros in early trade on monday .
italenergia , which also includes three large italian banks , already owns 52 % of montedison .
end of the battle their success in winning over montedison 's board puts to an end to their battle with the powerful italian bank mediobanca to win control of the energy company .
mediobanca , a 15 % shareholder which until recently controlled montedison through a shareholder pact , has conceded that it can no longer fight off the italenergia bid .
the only hurdle that remains to italenergia is the european competition authority , which still has to approve the deal .
the european commission confirmed on monday that it would be examining the takeover , since fiat 's involvement gave the deal a european dimension .
fiat earns less than two-thirds of its revenue in italy , pushing the montedison takeover into the eu 's jurisdiction .
even before it increased its bid , italenergia had been given the green light by stock market regulator consob .
this was after the consortium had accumulated a controlling interest in montedison - built up over the last few weeks .
prior objections prior to accepting the sweetened bid , montedison had argued that the takeover would violate competition laws , since it would give edf access to the italian electricity market .
fiat : a new investment powerhouse montedison 's power subsidiary , edison , is the second biggest generator in italy , and the main focus of acquisition interest .
there were also rumours last week that us power giant enron was planning to step in as a " white knight " to take over edison .
montedison has interests from agri-business to shipbuilding .
fiat sees a montedison takeover as a vital step in its transformation from a car maker into a diversified investment holding company .
the italian government seems to be untroubled by the prospect of edf entering the market , as long as it remains only a minority partner in italenergia .
