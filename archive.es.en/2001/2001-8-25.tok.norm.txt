equitable 's chief executive has told the bbc that the package will offer some payment for members who do not have guarantees on their pensions , as well as those who do .
the deal was originally intended to get those people with generous pension guarantees to give them up in exchange for a lump sum .
however , there are now further fears about mis-selling claims from policyholders without guarantees .
huge burden of costs the generous guarantees equitable offered on pensions until the late 1980s have saddled it with huge unquantifiable costs , leading to fears it will not be able to honour its promises .
but recently concern has arisen that there will be further calls on the equitable 's funds from mis-selling claims .
policy holders without guarantees argue they did not know when they bought their policies of the existence of the guarantees and the resulting liabilities .
both groups saw the value of their pension policies cut by 16 % last month .
equitable chief executive charles thomson has confirmed to bbc radio 's 4 's inside money programme that a forthcoming compromise deal will offer something for these people too .
expert legal advice he said lawyer nicholas warren qc has been investigating what his organisation should do next .
mr thomson told the bbc : " we have heard enough from him to make us believe that we must build this into the compromise scheme .
" we need to make sure that is done as appropriate depending on what our legal advice is so that the one pot is shared as fairly as we can amongst all the policy holders . "
a draft of the compromise scheme is expected next month and it is hoped equitable members might vote by the end of the year .

i just have n't got any anger toward them .
god just took it all away charles fain charles fain was convicted of raping and then drowning a nine-year-old girl in 1982 and has been imprisoned in the us state of idaho since 1984 .
but a judge ordered his release two hours after new dna tests showed conclusively that hairs found on the young girl did not belong to mr fain , who is now 52 .
mr fain , who became deeply religious shortly after his incarceration , said he felt no hostility against those who wrongly convicted him .
" i just have n't got any anger toward them .
god just took it all away , " mr fain told the associated press news agency .
evidence overturned the hairs were the principle evidence used against mr fain during his trial , according to prison officials .
according to the death penalty information centre , mr fain is the 97th death row inmate exonerated since 1973 and the 11th whose case involved a dna exclusion .
convicts are not automatically entitled to dna testing .
in mr fain 's case the district judge had to authorise funds for the forensic testing .
" when this dna stuff stated coming on in the news , something just told me it was going to be part of this case , " said mr fain .
faulty convictions a recent study of the death penalty in the us found that two-thirds of all capital convictions are overturned on appeal .
of the cases where courts ordered a new trial , 7 % were acquitted , while 75 % were convicted but sentenced to lesser punishment .
there are no definitive cases of innocent people having been executed , but the numbers of people released from death row on appeal have raised suspicions .
only a small number were cleared by dna evidence and the rest for a variety of reasons , including recanted testimony , evidence overlooked or withheld or inadequate legal representation .
dna testing is becoming increasingly important in challenging existing convictions .

sun 's staroffice running on linux by bbc news online 's ivan noble just how hard is it to kit out your pc with linux , the free software operating system which was first announced 10 years ago on saturday ?
the answer is : it depends .
if you have enough technical confidence to install a new hard drive or graphics card in your system , you are probably easily capable of dealing with linux .
and if your machine is reasonably modern and does not have too many unusual add-ons , linux will probably run without too many hitches .
side by side ?
the installation is more complicated if you want to hang on to an existing microsoft windows set-up and install linux alongside it , so that you decide whether you want windows or linux each time you boot the machine .
linux distributions tested suse linux 7.2 professional caldera openlinux 3.1 workstation and if , like many linux users , you are installing it on an older machine , perhaps to lend new life to a pc which would otherwise be given away , you may have to live with a very basic set-up .
microsoft is criticised by many people for releasing software which takes up acres of hard disk space , but the software installed by default in modern linux distributions can easily take up more than a gigabyte of disk space .
click here to read your experiences of linux .
though linux is available for free , organisations like red hat , caldera , suse and mandrake charge money for creating and selling distributions .
smoothing the way ?
these are packaged versions of linux with set-up tools designed to make installation easier .
but when these tools run into a situation their designers were not expecting , users end up having to wield a fair bit of technical expertise to get things back on track .
test machines four-year-old toshiba laptop with pentium 133mmx , 48mb ram two-year-old dell desktop with pentium ii 550 , 128mb ram suse linux installed first time on our laptop , but we could n't get it to recognise the machine 's sound chip , leaving our machine mute .
an e-mail to suse 's support service received a swift reply , but the answer did not help and we were left trawling linux websites for suggestions .
learning curve many would say this is all part of the linux experience .
installing linux does demand more of you , but by way of reward you end up with a much better understanding of how your computer works .
up and running we found a solution by trial and error , using a text editor to change the set-up files , but once we had made it work , we forgot what we 'd done and could not replicate our success - another learning experience , one might argue .
the first book i ever read about linux advised keeping a notebook and writing down every change as it was made .
we had even less luck with caldera 's distribution .
it did leave us with more space on our disk : the laptop had a 1.4gb drive and suse 's basic installation left us with less than 100mb free , while caldera left us twice as much .
trouble with x but caldera 's installation tool did n't have much luck with the graphics chip in our laptop and failed to set up x window properly .
x window is the display system running on top of linux 's unix-like text-only guts .
it is highly configurable , allowing users to customise the appearance of their machines , but if the set-up routine fails , you need some detailed knowledge of the specifications of both your graphics chip and monitor to get things going .
both distributions had far more success on our desktop machine , which , with 128mb ram and a 4gb hard disk , had enough space and power to cope .
and if you reach the happy stage of having a working system , both provide tools to make connecting to the internet as easy as it is under windows .
ten years on , installing linux is well within the capabilities of the kind of user who likes a bit of tinkering .
taking precautions but take it from someone who has made all the mistakes already : learn how to make a full disk image back-up of your system which will restore your system and data even if you wipe the entire hard disk learn how to back up and restore the partition table which stores details of how your hard disk is divided up between different file systems having learnt how to do this , do n't just pat yourself on the back for being geek of the week , go ahead and make the back-ups lay your hands on a copy of linux and , before you start , gather together as much technical information about the electronic guts of your pc as you can : model numbers , interrupt request numbers and memory addresses of things like sound cards and network cards read as much as you can bear of the manual and , unless you are 100 % confident about your back ups , try the whole thing on an old machine first .
one final top tip .
install linux on your own pc , not your employer 's or your friend 's .
no-one likes a tinkerer who leaves them a pc which does not boot .

david liddiment , itv 's director of channels , warned that british television is in danger of losing its " soul " in the search for ratings success .
speaking at the keynote mactaggart lecture at the guardian edinburgh television festival , he said " the relentless quest to find out what viewers want and then to give it to them has made for sameness " .
really great television has to do more than ... just bring in the numbers david liddiment and he singled out bbc one for criticism for failing to lead by example .
but mark thompson , director of television at the bbc , said he did not recognise the picture painted of bbc one .
" it was partial and he either ignored or dismissed all of the many programmes that would have disproved his argument , " he said .
" we do n't believe bbc one is perfect - that 's why we are investing heavily in high quality uk programmes for the future - across all genres , including those like science , arts and current affairs that rarely find a place in itv1 's peaktime schedule . "
mr liddiment stressed he was expressing his personal opinions , not those of itv .
mr liddiment also hit out at the bbc 's board of governors , for lack of accountability .
" a small group of lay people have what amounts to sovereign power over the most important cultural institution and biggest creative powerhouse in britain , " he said .
" do i trust them to do the job ?
no .

david liddiment , itv 's director of channels , warned that british television is in danger of losing its " soul " in the search for ratings success .
speaking at the keynote mactaggart lecture at the guardian edinburgh television festival , he said " the relentless quest to find out what viewers want and then to give it to them has made for sameness " .
really great television has to do more than ... just bring in the numbers david liddiment and he singled out bbc one for criticism for failing to lead by example .
but mark thompson , director of television at the bbc , said he did not recognise the picture painted of bbc one .
" it was partial and he either ignored or dismissed all of the many programmes that would have disproved his argument , " he said .
" we do n't believe bbc one is perfect - that 's why we are investing heavily in high quality uk programmes for the future - across all genres , including those like science , arts and current affairs that rarely find a place in itv1 's peaktime schedule . "
mr liddiment stressed he was expressing his personal opinions , not those of itv .
mr liddiment also hit out at the bbc 's board of governors , for lack of accountability .
" a small group of lay people have what amounts to sovereign power over the most important cultural institution and biggest creative powerhouse in britain , " he said .
" do i trust them to do the job ?
no .
nothing personal , but this is not the way to run a 21st century public body with huge cultural obligations as well as significant commercial interests . "

until this week there had been no new reports of foot-and-mouth in northumberland for about three months .
the new case is at stonehall farm at catton - just five miles from where the first new case was confirmed at taylor burn farm at ninebanks near allendale , on thursday .
disease facts total : 1,972 new cases on saturday : 2 slaughtered : 3,768,000 awaiting slaughter : 11,000 awaiting disposal : 3,000 the farm at the centre of the latest outbreak has 95 cattle and 800 sheep - most of these are expected to be destroyed over the weekend .
but two new cases in two days have left farmers worried about the true extent of the outbreak .
the newcastle disease emergency control centre -lrb- ndecc -rrb- is implementing even more stringent bio-security measures which may include a total ban on all animal movements in the area .
this is a severe blow to our hopes of achieving disease-free status for the north-east john bradbury , ndecc experts said the outbreak was a " bitter blow " , but that a few rogue cases in the twilight phase of the epidemic were to be expected .
there have also been one or two new daily cases in cumbria over the last weeks .
john bradbury , regional operations director at the ndecc , said the fresh outbreak mirrored the pattern of the last foot-and-mouth epidemic in 1967 .
but he added : " this is a severe blow to our hopes of achieving disease-free status for the north-east and a big disappointment for farmers in the region , as well as vets and others who have been working so hard to eradicate the disease . "
investigators have sealed off the farms and are tracing the origin of the disease .
they believe it is almost certain to have arrived at the remote hillside area by road - attached to animals , people or their vehicles .
an nfu spokesman said : " this is a stark reminder to all livestock producers and people visiting farms to ensure that they are continuing to do everything possible to guard animals against risk . "
disease warning experts have already warned the disease could drag on for many months .
epidemiologist dr neil ferguson , of imperial college , london , warned this week that the crisis would be harder to control in the poorer weather of autumn and winter if the disease was not eradicated .
farmers are urged to continue with disinfection precautions he also said foot-and-mouth disease had continued longer than expected because strict movement restrictions and hygiene rules had been breached by some farmers .
last week , the european commission -lrb- ec -rrb- announced it would give the uk £ 225m in compensation for the foot-and-mouth crisis , with more money expected to follow .
the payout comes as a first instalment , while the ec continues to assess the financial cost to european farmers following the devastating outbreak of the disease .
under eu farming policy , the commission has to pick up 60 % of the cost of an epidemic where whole herds have had to be destroyed .
the new cases come days after the uk 's first cattle auction since the outbreak begain , in the orkney islands . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's christine stewart " the slaughter of animals that many thought was over will now be repeated " richard ellison , regional director of the nfu " we were looking forward to having the final restrictions lifted " arthur griffiths , veterinary manager for defra " this disease is still out there " full special report a year to forget outbreak 's uk impact last county recovers tourism bouncing back ?

the bbc afghanistan correspondent , kate clark , looks at the tradition of the two great proselytising faiths - christianity and islam .
" go on , go on , just do it , it 's only a few words .
go on . "
it 's a hot , sweaty , mosquito-ridden evening and i 'm experiencing the heaviest proselytising of my life .
i feel i now know how people could succumb to brain washing .
i 'm reduced to the most basic arguments .
" i ca n't , my mum would be upset if i became a muslim . "
" that 's alright , " came the instant reply .
" you can lie to her . "
i was shocked .
" i ca n't lie to my mum , " i said .
" whatever happened to honouring your parents ? "
" yeah , it would be alright , it would be a lesser sin .
go on , just say those few little words . "
intense pressure the scene was a small town in south-eastern yemen , six years ago , in the hadramuaut region .
it 's the ancestral home of osama bin laden - now a wanted islamic militant holed up in afghanistan - but that 's not the reason i was there .
locals boast of having converted indonesia , malaysia , parts of india and east africa .
i could now understand why the hadramaut has been pushing out muslim missionaries for centuries .
and i 'd come to interview students and teachers at the ancient madrassas or religious seminaries .
locals boast of having converted indonesia , malaysia , parts of india and east africa to islam .
i could now understand why .
persuasive tactics what was making it more difficult was that every conversation i had there was in arabic - a language in which it 's virtually impossible to say the simplest sentence without invoking god .
and it 's so easy to convert to islam - you just make the testament of faith to a muslim - that you believe in one god and mohammed as his messenger - less than a dozen words in arabic - and bingo , you 've joined the faith .
arab muslims have been particularly fond of trying to convert me .
when i was working in the west bank , the first three questions i usually encountered were : " where are you from ? " , " are you married ? " and " what 's your religion ? "
even friends who are secular occasionally and off-handedly ask when i 'm going to convert .
one palestinian friend explained it by saying they believed it was a sure-fire way to paradise .
less overt afghanistan has been a very different experience .
not because afghans are n't devout - they 're more so if anything .
most afghans seem to pray and keep the ramadan fast , but they do it quietly and without much fuss .
religion seems to come up in conversation , if at all , a long way down the line , when you know people well .
and it 's never heavy - an exchange of information at most .
what 's ironic is how little sympathy any potential christian missionary receives in the west in the year 2001 it always seemed a bit rough that a religion which prizes missionary work as much as islam does should penalise anyone from their side who chooses to leave the faith .
but apostasy is one of the severest offences under religious law - a capital crime .
there are very few countries in the world where a death sentence might actually be carried out by the state , but afghanistan is one of them .
preaching christianity the idea that anyone might choose to go there to preach the gospel is chilling .

the bbc afghanistan correspondent , kate clark , looks at the tradition of the two great proselytising faiths - christianity and islam .
" go on , go on , just do it , it 's only a few words .
go on . "
it 's a hot , sweaty , mosquito-ridden evening and i 'm experiencing the heaviest proselytising of my life .
i feel i now know how people could succumb to brain washing .
i 'm reduced to the most basic arguments .
many muslims are eager to convert people " i ca n't , my mum would be upset if i became a muslim . "
" that 's alright , " came the instant reply .
" you can lie to her . "
i was shocked .
" i ca n't lie to my mum , " i said .
" whatever happened to honouring your parents ? "
" yeah , it would be alright , it would be a lesser sin .
go on , just say those few little words . "
intense pressure the scene was a small town in south-eastern yemen , six years ago , in the hadramuaut region .
it 's the ancestral home of osama bin laden - now a wanted islamic militant holed up in afghanistan - but that 's not the reason i was there .
locals boast of having converted indonesia , malaysia , parts of india and east africa .
i could now understand why the hadramaut has been pushing out muslim missionaries for centuries .
and i 'd come to interview students and teachers at the ancient madrassas or religious seminaries .
locals boast of having converted indonesia , malaysia , parts of india and east africa to islam .
i could now understand why .
persuasive tactics what was making it more difficult was that every conversation i had there was in arabic - a language in which it 's virtually impossible to say the simplest sentence without invoking god .
women in afghanistan wear obvious muslim dress and it 's so easy to convert to islam - you just make the testament of faith to a muslim - that you believe in one god and mohammed as his messenger - less than a dozen words in arabic - and bingo , you 've joined the faith .
arab muslims have been particularly fond of trying to convert me .
when i was working in the west bank , the first three questions i usually encountered were : " where are you from ? " , " are you married ? " and " what 's your religion ? "
even friends who are secular occasionally and off-handedly ask when i 'm going to convert .
one palestinian friend explained it by saying they believed it was a sure-fire way to paradise .
less overt afghanistan has been a very different experience .
not because afghans are n't devout - they 're more so if anything .
most afghans seem to pray and keep the ramadan fast , but they do it quietly and without much fuss .
religion seems to come up in conversation , if at all , a long way down the line , when you know people well .
and it 's never heavy - an exchange of information at most .
what 's ironic is how little sympathy any potential christian missionary receives in the west in the year 2001 it always seemed a bit rough that a religion which prizes missionary work as much as islam does should penalise anyone from their side who chooses to leave the faith .
but apostasy is one of the severest offences under religious law - a capital crime .
there are very few countries in the world where a death sentence might actually be carried out by the state , but afghanistan is one of them .
preaching christianity the idea that anyone might choose to go there to preach the gospel is chilling .
yet that 's precisely what the workers from shelter now international are accused of .

i had nurtured the dream that after independence i would have time to cultivate pumpkins and animals xanana gusmao mr gusmao - widely viewed as the hero of the struggle for independence - said he was standing in response to pressure from the people , and with the encouragement of foreign governments .
the announcement ends months of speculation and reverses previous statements that he would not stand in the election expected early next year .
our correspondent richard galpin says it is almost a foregone conclusion that mr gusmao will now be elected president next year .
credible leader to cheers and applause , mr gusmao told a meeting in the capital , dili , that he was ready to accept the candidacy for president , but added : " i am conscious that i am not the best person for the job .
" it 's true that i have begun to feel tired as a consequence of 25 years of heavy responsibility .
he is not terribly happy but he 's a remarkable individual independence leader jose ramos horta " i had nurtured the dream that after independence i would have time to cultivate pumpkins and animals . "
he added : " i changed my position because of pressure from the people and from foreign governments , including the us . "
most timorese see mr gusmao , 55 , as the only credible leader who can unite the fledgling nation .
east timor has been administered by the united nations since its people voted to break away from indonesia in 1999 .
it is expected to gain full independence in 2002 .
hero independence leader jose ramos horta told the bbc that mr gusmao was persuaded to run because he had the overwhelming support of the people and the international community , and he was seen as the only candidate who had the respect of the indonesian military , which occupied east timor for some 25 years .
he said : " he bowed to the pressure .
" he is not terribly happy but he 's a remarkable individual .
" now he has accepted his responsibility and he will fulfil his mandate when he 's elected with generosity , with total dedication to the people . "
the un 's administrator in east timor , sergio vieira de mello , said : " it will send a very powerful message to the timorese people .
" i think this will inspire confidence to the population and i believe it 's the right choice because xanana has an important role to play . "
mr gusmao led a guerrilla war for many years against indonesia , which invaded east timor in 1975 .
he was captured in 1992 and imprisoned until 1999 .
constituent assembly his announcement comes days before east timor holds its first democratic election for an 88-member assembly that will draft a constitution .
the assembly will decide on what system will be used to govern east timor .
it will also decide how the country 's president and parliament will be elected .
mr gusmao said his candidacy was conditional on a peaceful outcome to the vote on thursday , which must be accepted by all political groups .
" this means each party must promote ... the policy of tolerance and mutual respect in the democratic spirit which we are all engaged in developing , " he said .
after the east timorese voted to sever ties with indonesia in 1999 , a campaign of killings and destruction by pro-jakarta militias gripped the territory until an australian-led international peacekeeping force arrived in september 1999 .
the united nations now administers east timor with the help of a peacekeeping force of nearly 8,000 troops .
