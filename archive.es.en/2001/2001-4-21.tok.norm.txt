the pact was drawn up to encourage politicians not to use racist language during the forthcoming general election campaign .
on friday , the shadow chancellor , michael portillo became the most senior conservative to refuse to sign the cre 's code of conduct .
one tory backbencher has said the commission 's action reminded him of the anti-communist witch-hunts in the united states in the 1950s .
i went into public life to speak for myself and i will use my own language , my own words michael portillo but the commission 's vicki kennedy said there had been no intention to make mps feel pressured into signing the document , and they were free to publish their reasons for not doing so on the cre website .
the cre had merely acted as a " mediator " between the parties in drawing up the pact , and the pressure to sign had come largely from opposition politicians and the media , she said .
but the commission has also stressed that the pact should not deter politicians from " robustly debating " sensitive issues such as asylum and immigration .
some 78 % of labour mps , 100 % of liberal democrats and 35 % of conservatives have so far signed the compact .
' offensive ' labour has said that all its mps will be expected to sign .
but the pact has attracted increasing criticism , with some other tory mps rejecting it and a former minister calling it " loathsome and offensive " .
conservative party chairman michael ancram insists it was clear from the start party leader william hague had signed the compact on behalf of the whole party .
ancram : warned candidates on racism asked about it during a trip to wales on friday mr portillo said : " no , i have n't signed it because i speak for myself and i have said that i offer equality of esteem to everyone in this country .
" i do n't like signing bits of paper and questionnaires thrust in front of me .
" i went into public life to speak for myself and i will use my own language , my own words . "
the cre pledge labour : 269 of 417 mps signed tory : 55 of 160 signed , 4 refused lib dem : 45 of 47 signed others : 9 signed mr portillo 's comments have dramatically increased the tempo in the debate on racism in politics - and could be seen as an embarrassment to mr hague .
the pact commits politicians " not to pitch one group against another for short term political or personal gain " .
and it commits the main party leaders - who all signed it - to taking action against any candidates or campaigners who provoke racial prejudice .
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said on saturday that the tories were " self-destructing " over the race issue , and that mr hague was attempting to kindle fears over immigration and asylum .
he said : " mr hague says that britain is turning into ' a foreign land ' and that we are becoming over-run with ' bogus asylum seekers ' .
" in using language like this , the conservative leader has fostered a climate in his party where racist sentiment can be given voice . "
mr kennedy also commented on mr portillo 's decision not to sign the cre 's pact , saying it " owes more to his conservative leadership aspirations than it does to a decent and sensible debate about asylum and immigration " . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's polly billington " this is n't just about different approaches to debating race in politics " the bbc 's guto harri " the situation was getting out of control " conservative party chairman , michael ancram " william hague signed the compact on behalf of the whole conservative party " talking point race row should race be an election issue ?

as we have said in the past , our primary concern is for safety nasa spokeswoman the 60-year-old us businessman is believed to be paying russia $ 20m for the trip , which was originally destined for mir , but which was switched to the international space station -lrb- iss -rrb- when it became clear mir was being ditched .
nasa has not confirmed any agreement , but an official says a proposal has been drafted to get mr tito into orbit next month - but only as an exceptional case .
if all goes as he hopes , mr tito will become the world 's first space tourist when a soyuz rocket blasts off from kazakstan on 28 april .
dennis tito will fly as scheduled russian spokesman for months , nasa has opposed mr tito 's space station visit on safety grounds .
the partners of the iss - the canadian space agency , the european space agency and nasda , the japanese space agency - are still discussing ways to resolve the issue and reach a consensus .
" we 're still working with our partners to reach a consenus " , said nasa spokeswoman kirsten larson .
" as we have said in the past our primary concern is for safety " .
training meanwhile , russian space officials stood firm over their right to send tito to the space station .
" nothing has changed or will change .
dennis tito will fly as scheduled with the other members of his crew on 28 april , " a spokesman for russia 's space agency said .
dennis tito : " i 've had this dream so long " mr tito has been training to ride into space for months at cosmonaut headquarters in star city , russia .
russia says that he is well trained for the mission and that it has the right to send him to the iss , quoting international agreements that give it complete control over who flies on its spacecraft .
but the united states , the leading partner in the 16-nation space station consortium , maintains that tito lacks the training or russian language skills to ensure his safety or that of the crews of the space station .
nasa has softened its rhetoric during the past week , saying it wanted to ensure that mr tito would not jeopardise anyone 's safety aboard the space station or disrupt the crew 's work .

judge charles pannell ruled that alice randall 's novel the wind done gone was a pirated version of miss mitchell 's 1936 epic of the american civil war , and he granted an injunction preventing its publication .
randall 's book has gained support from authors if you will pardon the distortion of rhett butler 's classic line , " frankly my dear " , judge pannell made it clear that he " did n't give a damn " for alice randall 's argument that her work was a political parody .
her story was written from the perspective of scarlett o 'hara 's mixed-race half-sister on the georgia plantation which was the setting for the original novel and the subsequent oscar-winning film starring clark gable and vivien leigh .
copyright miss randall gathered a formidable array of literary supporters to back her claim that parody was an important element of free speech .
she said her work was designed to ridicule a book that had portrayed black slaves as a happy , supportive backdrop to white masters in the racist confederate south .
gone with the wind is an enduring classic movie but attorneys for miss mitchell 's estate argued successfully that the crux of this case was not freedom of expression but the protection of a writer 's creativity and copyright .
judge pannell agreed , ruling that alice randall 's story borrowed too liberally from gone with the wind and constituted unabated piracy .
a spokesman for the mitchell trust described it as a marvellous decision which protected authors and publishers .
houghton mifflin , the publishers who backed miss randall , said they had a tradition of fighting for america 's first amendment , which protects freedom of speech , and would continue to do so .
as scarlett o 'hara would say after losing everything - " tomorrow is another day " .
