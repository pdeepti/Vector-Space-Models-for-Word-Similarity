bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- code red keeps world guessing categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 1 august , 2001 , 05:42 gmt 06:42 uk code red keeps world guessing question over how much damage the worm will do the code red worm computer bug has had no immediately visible effect on the internet , security experts say .
but they have cautioned that the impact of the worm 's attack , which was expected to begin as the new month started at midnight gmt on wednesday , might become evident later .
in a bid to limit the number of machines the worm can infect , law enforcement agencies , business groups and governments urged people to check if their computers were infected and to install software that could stop the malicious program taking them over .
code red worm what is it ?
code red is a malicious program that can scan the web by itself looking for computers it can copy itself to .
how does it work ?
on certain dates , all infected machines are supposed to bombard the white house website with bogus data packets .
for the rest of the month , infected computers will be scanning for uninfected machines .
it also briefly replaces web pages with the text " hacked by chinese " .
what effect does it have ?
as yet unknown .
the white house avoided the attack by changing the internet address of its website , but all those machines looking for new homes for the virus could cause some disruption .
how can it be stopped ?
infection can be avoided by using microsoft patch programs .
software is also available to remove the worm from infected machines .
computers that are infected and scanning should be rebooted and then disinfected .
but a company that monitors website traffic , keynote systems inc , has reported that traffic appears normal at some of the most-visited us websites , such as yahoo , google and excite .
" if the proliferation of the worm and its resulting traffic was going to affect internet performance , it would surely be seen in these sites , " keynote spokeswoman mary lindsay said .
" so i guess it remains to be seen ...
everything is quiet . "
millions of computer systems appeared well prepared , because of a free software patch from microsoft .
" it 's something like the y2k bug , because everyone was prepared , " said ravi venkatesam of at atesto technologies in california .
" because everyone protects themselves , it turns out to be a dud .
but that 's a good thing because it means that everyone has protected themselves . "
but us officials said more time was needed to determine whether the internet had managed to escape the worm 's wrath .
" it will take a while for pertinent analysis to be conducted , " fbi spokeswoman debby weierman said .
" we 're not going to get a definitive sense of what has transpired for a few hours . "
net is strong the net is built to withstand disruption and the worm attacks only a fraction of all net-connected machines .
governments have issued a warning about the worm because they fear that the increase in web traffic caused by all those copies of code red looking for vulnerable machines could severely disrupt the normal working of the net .
the worm reportedly spends two-thirds of every month looking for new machines to infect and the rest of the time using these machines to bombard the site of the white house , with bogus data packets .
for the last few days of every month , it lies dormant .
the code red worm exploits vulnerabilities in versions 4.0 and 5.0 of microsoft 's internet information server software that is bundled in with some copies of the windows nt and 2000 operating system .
defences microsoft has made available a patch that closes the loophole that code red exploits and many anti-virus companies have produced software that can find and remove the malicious program from infected machines .
worm targeted the white house 's website nevertheless , according to a california company , computer economics , code red has already cost about $ 1.2bn in damage to networks .
that makes it more destructive than the 1999 melissa virus -lrb- $ 1bn -rrb- but less damaging than last year 's love bug virus -lrb- $ 8.7bn -rrb- .
the cost of cleaning up and protecting systems from code red is estimated at nearly $ 740m .
code red differs from many recently successful viruses because it is relatively sophisticated and uses a variety of techniques to hide and do damage .
as the worm scans for up to three weeks of every month , the most compromised networks should soon become obvious .
the scanning is unlikely to be co-ordinated because many net-connected systems have their internal clocks set to the wrong time .
for many , the only difference it might make to their web browsing experience could be to make web pages take longer to appear and perhaps delay the delivery of e-mail messages for a short while . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's nick bryant " so far so good " rex frank , alvaka networks , los angeles " this is a wake up call , the next generation could be a lot more destructive " ron dick , fbi speaks about the precautions the us government has taken to protect against viruses graham clueley , technology consultant " it can hack into your website and deface your main page " the bbc 's julian siddle looks at some of the most successful computer viruses key stories code red threat tailing off code red cost tops $ 1.2bn white house dodges web virus pentagon avoids virus threat background are computer viruses unstoppable ?

the playfair project - named after the building - aims to raise £ 26m to pay for a new " subterranean space " beneath princes street .
if completed it would provide the national galleries with an extra 15,000 square feet of exhibition space , creating one of the largest facilities of its type in britain .
the lottery funding leaves project organisers with a shortfall of £ 6m .
timothy clifford : " major player on the international stage " the royal scottish academy , which is home to the contemporary arts north of the border , co-occupies the playfair building at the foot of the mound with the national galleries .
both organisations say the extra space is badly needed to expand the arts in scotland .
the additional space created by the underground extension would mean that blockbuster exhibitions , like the current rembrandt one , would not displace the permanent collection on the mound .
dr timothy clifford , director-general of the national galleries said the new space would not only " improve the quality of our facilities and resources for the communities which we serve , but it will ensure that scotland is a major player on the international stage " .
he added : " soon we will have a gloriously refurbished and upgraded royal scottish academy building linked to the existing national gallery by an underground extension - discreet , chic , adventurous and welcoming . "

the global downturn in the technology sector has weakened demand for electronic products , with semiconductor exports down by nearly two-thirds and computer exports down 37 % .
during july the country 's trade surplus fell to $ 459m , down from $ 784m a year earlier .
gloomy prospects for exports and production will put more pressure on policymakers to act kwon hyeuk-boo economist and compared to june this year , the figures are even worse .
then buoyant exports had given the country a $ 1.35bn surplus .
the global downturn is clearly harming south korean manufacturers , with exports down to $ 11.6bn , a drop of 20 % compared to a year earlier .
it was the sharpest fall in exports this year so far , and commerce ministry officials said the picture would darken during the coming months .
they described the data as a sign of a prolonged economic slump .
the figures came as a nasty surprise for financial markets , which had expected exports to fall by just 15 % .
inflation threatens rate cuts the export industry is of vital importance to south korea 's economy , accounting for about 45 % of overall output .
even worse , when exporters are in trouble , domestic demand dries up as well , as manufacturers buy less in the way of machines and raw materials .
and with exports flagging , the central bank in seoul estimates that the weakness of the global economy could cut south korean growth to as little as 3.8 % .
the original forecast had been a growth rate of well above 5 % .
but the central bank is in a quandary .
rate cuts to boost the economy are unlikely because price rises have now gone above the bank 's target range .
the inflation figures , also published on wednesday , were mainly driven by " higher agricultural prices stemming from heavy rainfall this month after a severe drought in june " , said the national statistical office .

the global downturn in the technology sector has weakened demand for electronic products , with semiconductor exports down by nearly two-thirds and computer exports down 37 % .
during july the country 's trade surplus fell to $ 459m , down from $ 784m a year earlier .
gloomy prospects for exports and production will put more pressure on policymakers to act kwon hyeuk-boo economist and compared to june this year , the figures are even worse .
then buoyant exports had given the country a $ 1.35bn surplus .
the global downturn is clearly harming south korean manufacturers , with exports down to $ 11.6bn , a drop of 20 % compared to a year earlier .
it was the sharpest fall in exports this year so far , and commerce ministry officials said the picture would darken during the coming months .
they described the data as a sign of a prolonged economic slump .
the figures came as a nasty surprise for financial markets , which had expected exports to fall by just 15 % .
inflation threatens rate cuts the export industry is of vital importance to south korea 's economy , accounting for about 45 % of overall output .
even worse , when exporters are in trouble , domestic demand dries up as well , as manufacturers buy less in the way of machines and raw materials .
and with exports flagging , the central bank in seoul estimates that the weakness of the global economy could cut south korean growth to as little as 3.8 % .
the original forecast had been a growth rate of well above 5 % .
but the central bank is in a quandary .
rate cuts to boost the economy are unlikely because price rises have now gone above the bank 's target range .
the inflation figures , also published on wednesday , were mainly driven by " higher agricultural prices stemming from heavy rainfall this month after a severe drought in june " , said the national statistical office .

the national criminal intelligence service -lrb- ncis -rrb- received 18,408 disclosures from the financial sector to its economic crime unit -lrb- ecu -rrb- .
investigators believe the increase of nearly 27 % from the previous year is as a result of better awareness of the problem and improvements to databases .
solicitors and accountants continue to give concern andy blezzard ecu money laundering - helping to hide the proceeds of crime - carries a maximum penalty of 14 years ' imprisonment or an unlimited fine or both .
the law allows professionals to report suspicions of money laundering to the authorities .
making a disclosure is not treated as a breach of any duty of confidentiality to a client .
high-profile cases ecu head andy blezzard said the increase in disclosures this year was partly down to efforts to raise awareness by the authorities and trade bodies .
awareness was also raised by the reporting of several large money laundering cases in the media .
he said the implementation of a new disclosures database had proved to be highly successful .
" on the down side , we note , once again , that whilst the majority of disclosures still originate from the banking sector , there are still many such organisations that disclose very few , if any , suspicious transaction reports . "
he said that out of 575 registered banks only 170 , less than 30 % , made any suspicious transaction reports during last year .
' vulnerable ' institutions he added : " solicitors and accountants continue to give concern with very few reports being made despite their relative attractiveness to launderers .
" accordingly , concerns remain that some of the financial institutions and sectors lack sufficient adherence to the regulations and disclosure obligations .
" they may not have adequate training provisions and reporting systems in place , leaving themselves vulnerable to laundering attempts . "
he said ecu would tackle reticent sectors such as betting and gaming organisations , money transmission agents and bureaux de change .
greater automation " we are also mindful of the impact of technology , " he said .
" face-to-face contact with customers has reduced for banks and other financial institutions as more people have moved to telephone and postal banking .
" this is likely to continue with the spread of the internet , the establishment of call-centres and greater automation .
" the identification of suspicious transactions is therefore an increasing challenge for banks and other institutions . "
