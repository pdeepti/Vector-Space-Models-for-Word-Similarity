bush has surrounded himself with powerful figures by jonny dymond in washington on a bitterly cold day in january , george w bush took his place in what he called a long story .
not everyone was celebrating as thousands of protesters took to the streets .
mr bush did not get a majority of the popular vote .
he has trod carefully establishing himself .
but he is proving a different kind of president from those who have come before .
" he was a cheerleader in high school , and i think he is a very effective cheerleader for the administration , " said stephen wayne , a professor of government at georgetown university .
" that does not mean that he 's not involved or not signing off on the major decisions .
i am sure that he is . "
president bush views his role as that of a washington outsider with the american people rather than a wonkish washington insider .
" he has always been interested in people more than politics , " mr wayne said .
influential advisors within the white house , george bush 's political advisers hold real power ; the undisputed chief is his former campaign manager and strategist karl rove .
nicknamed " the boy genius " by bush , he 's also been called president rove .
" karl rove is described by some people as george bush 's brain , and given that the president is sometimes said not to have the largest intellect , karl rove becomes even more important , " said james carney , white house correspondent for time magazine .
" karl rove is probably the most influential and important political consultant to a president that we 've ever seen , " he added .
bush has surrounded himself with men and women with long government experience ; in the most powerful positions , many served his father .
vice-president cheney was defence secretary in the early 1990s .
he is perhaps the most powerful vice-president ever to serve .
defence secretary donald rumsfeld has held the post before .
he is reviewing the role of the us military .
he served before with dick cheney and is a close ally of the vice-president .
secretary of state colin powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and served as ronald reagan 's national security adviser ; he is said to have fundamental policy differences with the other two .
together , these three men have decades of foreign policy experience .
george bush has virtually none .
team players ?
" the real question for the administration will be down the road when people disagree , and disagree very strongly on they issue , " said james lindsay of the brookings institution .
" are they going to be able to keep the disputes in house , or are people going to want to go out and hang out dirty laundry ? " he asked , adding : " we do n't know that yet . "
there is much talk in washington as to who really runs this administration : political advisers or senior cabinet members ?
the truth is more complex .
these are very early days in a four-year term .
the true test for president bush will be whether he will be able to pull his powerful team together in more difficult times .

such a move would pave the way for impeachment proceedings to begin , possibly within weeks .
several thousand of mr wahid 's supporters rallied in drenching rain in jakarta , but pulled back from a planned march to parliament , which is surrounded by razor wire and guarded by thousands of police and troops .
on sunday , mr wahid appealed to his followers not to resort to violence .
but his most radical supporters , who travelled to the capital from east java , have pledged to fight to death to protect him , raising fears of an outburst of violence if the censure motion is passed .
opposition united opposition politicians say almost all the parties have agreed to pass the second censure motion against mr wahid for his alleged part in two financial scandals , involving the misuse of $ 6m .
the president - who has repeatedly protested his innocence - will then have one month to respond .
if the legislators are not satisfied with mr wahid 's response , there is likely to be a special session of the highest legislative body , which need only a simple majority to vote the president out of office .
but the bbc 's richard galpin in jakarta says mr wahid is determined to stay in office - and he has thousands of supporters who are willing to fight a " holy war " for him .
our correspondent says a pro-wahid rally held in jakarta on sunday was meant as a warning to members of parliament that they are playing with fire by trying to impeach the president .
dressed in muslim white robes and green scarves , some of his supporters were visibly upset at the prospect of mr wahid 's impeachment .
quoting from the koran , the president accused his opponents of trying to oust him illegally .
but , in an emotional address , mr wahid urged people not to resort to violence and the event passed off largely peacefully .
the allegations the president was censured by parliament at the beginning of february .
mr wahid has always denied financial wrongdoings in the two scandals that parliament has been investigating .
one of the scandals , dubbed bulogate , involves the president 's personal masseur who allegedly fled with $ 4m from the national food agency , bulog .
the other scandal , bruneigate , refers to an alleged $ 2m donation from the sultan of brunei .

army officials said 15 members of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- had been gunned down .
five soldiers were also killed in the clash .
recently , the area has seen intense fighting between leftist rebels , outlawed right-wing paramilitary groups and government troops .
meanwhile , the united states announced that one paramilitary group , the self-defence units of colombia -lrb- auc -rrb- , is to be listed as a terrorist organisation .
but , unlike left-wing rebel movements , the right-wing paramilitaries are not perceived as a threat to us national security , and washington is not expected to take any measures against them .
elusive peace the auc , which has about 8,000 fighters , is believed to be responsible for the majority of the escalating killings which are plaguing the country .
last year about 236 attacks are believed to have claimed over 1,200 lives .
under the leadership of carlos castano , the auc also opposes any attempts by president andres pastrana 's government to hold peace talks with the left-wing rebels .
the auc paramilitaries have complicated government efforts to begin formal negotiations with the rebel national liberation army -lrb- eln -rrb- - which is smaller than the farc - by attacking the group 's established bases in the northern bolivar province .
peace talks between the largest rebel group , the farc , and the government began two years ago , but so far no ceasefire has been agreed .
