bush has surrounded himself with powerful figures by jonny dymond in washington on a bitterly cold day in january , george w bush took his place in what he called a long story .
not everyone was celebrating as thousands of protesters took to the streets .
mr bush did not get a majority of the popular vote .
he has trod carefully establishing himself .
but he is proving a different kind of president from those who have come before .
" he was a cheerleader in high school , and i think he is a very effective cheerleader for the administration , " said stephen wayne , a professor of government at georgetown university .
" that does not mean that he 's not involved or not signing off on the major decisions .
i am sure that he is . "
president bush views his role as that of a washington outsider with the american people rather than a wonkish washington insider .
" he has always been interested in people more than politics , " mr wayne said .
influential advisors within the white house , george bush 's political advisers hold real power ; the undisputed chief is his former campaign manager and strategist karl rove .
nicknamed " the boy genius " by bush , he 's also been called president rove .
" karl rove is described by some people as george bush 's brain , and given that the president is sometimes said not to have the largest intellect , karl rove becomes even more important , " said james carney , white house correspondent for time magazine .
" karl rove is probably the most influential and important political consultant to a president that we 've ever seen , " he added .
bush has surrounded himself with men and women with long government experience ; in the most powerful positions , many served his father .
vice-president cheney was defence secretary in the early 1990s .
he is perhaps the most powerful vice-president ever to serve .
defence secretary donald rumsfeld has held the post before .
he is reviewing the role of the us military .
he served before with dick cheney and is a close ally of the vice-president .
secretary of state colin powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and served as ronald reagan 's national security adviser ; he is said to have fundamental policy differences with the other two .
together , these three men have decades of foreign policy experience .
george bush has virtually none .
team players ?
" the real question for the administration will be down the road when people disagree , and disagree very strongly on they issue , " said james lindsay of the brookings institution .
" are they going to be able to keep the disputes in house , or are people going to want to go out and hang out dirty laundry ? " he asked , adding : " we do n't know that yet . "
there is much talk in washington as to who really runs this administration : political advisers or senior cabinet members ?
the truth is more complex .
these are very early days in a four-year term .
the true test for president bush will be whether he will be able to pull his powerful team together in more difficult times .

health minister john hutton said : " we have to be satisfied that people who bring children into this country for the purposes of adoption have been properly vetted and this law will hopefully ensure that there are safeguards for these children . "

such a move would pave the way for impeachment proceedings to begin , possibly within weeks .
several thousand of mr wahid 's supporters rallied in drenching rain in jakarta , but pulled back from a planned march to parliament , which is surrounded by razor wire and guarded by thousands of police and troops .
on sunday , mr wahid appealed to his followers not to resort to violence .
but his most radical supporters , who travelled to the capital from east java , have pledged to fight to death to protect him , raising fears of an outburst of violence if the censure motion is passed .
opposition united opposition politicians say almost all the parties have agreed to pass the second censure motion against mr wahid for his alleged part in two financial scandals , involving the misuse of $ 6m .
the president - who has repeatedly protested his innocence - will then have one month to respond .
if the legislators are not satisfied with mr wahid 's response , there is likely to be a special session of the highest legislative body , which need only a simple majority to vote the president out of office .
but the bbc 's richard galpin in jakarta says mr wahid is determined to stay in office - and he has thousands of supporters who are willing to fight a " holy war " for him .
our correspondent says a pro-wahid rally held in jakarta on sunday was meant as a warning to members of parliament that they are playing with fire by trying to impeach the president .
dressed in muslim white robes and green scarves , some of his supporters were visibly upset at the prospect of mr wahid 's impeachment .
quoting from the koran , the president accused his opponents of trying to oust him illegally .
but , in an emotional address , mr wahid urged people not to resort to violence and the event passed off largely peacefully .
the allegations the president was censured by parliament at the beginning of february .
mr wahid has always denied financial wrongdoings in the two scandals that parliament has been investigating .
one of the scandals , dubbed bulogate , involves the president 's personal masseur who allegedly fled with $ 4m from the national food agency , bulog .
the other scandal , bruneigate , refers to an alleged $ 2m donation from the sultan of brunei .

army officials said 15 members of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- had been gunned down .
five soldiers were also killed in the clash .
recently , the area has seen intense fighting between leftist rebels , outlawed right-wing paramilitary groups and government troops .
meanwhile , the united states announced that one paramilitary group , the self-defence units of colombia -lrb- auc -rrb- , is to be listed as a terrorist organisation .
but , unlike left-wing rebel movements , the right-wing paramilitaries are not perceived as a threat to us national security , and washington is not expected to take any measures against them .
elusive peace the auc , which has about 8,000 fighters , is believed to be responsible for the majority of the escalating killings which are plaguing the country .
last year about 236 attacks are believed to have claimed over 1,200 lives .
under the leadership of carlos castano , the auc also opposes any attempts by president andres pastrana 's government to hold peace talks with the left-wing rebels .
the auc paramilitaries have complicated government efforts to begin formal negotiations with the rebel national liberation army -lrb- eln -rrb- - which is smaller than the farc - by attacking the group 's established bases in the northern bolivar province .
peace talks between the largest rebel group , the farc , and the government began two years ago , but so far no ceasefire has been agreed .
