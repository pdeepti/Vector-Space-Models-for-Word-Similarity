shop stewards say they will oppose any compulsory redundancies at the company 's yards on the clyde at govan and scotstoun .
bae says it will try to minimise the effect of the cuts by offering early retirement , voluntary redundancy , redeployment and help with relocation .
but union officials have vowed that they will not lie down and accept the job losses , which are being made despite bae winning a lucrative order to build six royal navy warships .
john edmonds , general secretary of the gmb union , said he was " shocked and devastated " by the news .
" workers were expecting an announcement which would secure jobs , not result in 1,000 jobs being axed , " he said .
the losses were announced on tuesday afternoon .
more than 1,000 jobs will go on the river clyde , in glasgow , and a further 150 will be cut at barrow-in-furness , in cumbria .
danny carrigan , national officer of the amalgamated engineering & electrical union , said : " we will not take these job losses lying down . "
' black day ' john wall , national officer of the manufacturing science & finance union , said vital skills would be lost to the yards and warned that workers would have to be recruited from overseas to meet future orders .
he added : " this is a black day for the shipbuilding industry . "
uk defence secretary geoff hoon said work on the anti-aircraft type 45 destroyers would be split between two companies - bae systems and vosper thornycroft .
but simon kirby , managing director of bae systems marine , said the announcement would do nothing to ease the lack of work in the short-term .
" we have done everything we can to address this situation but regrettably have been left with no alternative other than to announce these redundancies , " said mr kirby .
" i recognise the concern that this announcement will cause our employees , their families and the local communities and we are determined to handle this restructuring sensitively and professionally . "
subdued mood however , in his statement , mr hoon said the contract would secure a long term future for bae 's yards .
he said : " the first of class ship will be assembled and launched at scotstoun , the focus of design support to the whole class will remain there , with continuing participation by both shipbuilders .
" the remaining ships will be assembled and launched at barrow .
" based on the company 's own estimates , once this total construction programme is up and running , work on type 45 should sustain a steady level of some 1,200 jobs on the clyde and around a further 900 jobs at barrow-in-furness .
" i understand that , in light of this package of work , the company has no plans to close any of its yards . "
mr hoon said the cost of the six ships will be around £ 4.3 billion , with deliveries starting in 2007 .
the mood at bae 's govan yard after the job cuts were announced was subdued .
the news was given to staff at a mass meeting and jim mcfall , 47 , who has worked as a trainman for the past 22 years , said the announcement had come as a huge blow to workers .
he said : " everybody is very subdued , but there are a lot of questions still to answer just now .
" we heard in the last couple of weeks these figures of 500 to 1,000 jobs , but as soon as we heard that figure of 1,000 it was a blow .
it really is a surprise for everyone . "

they have found a genetic similarity between the tb bacterium and fungi , which they believe makes the bacterium vulnerable to these drugs .
tb is on the rise in africa tuberculosis kills two million people each year , a figure that is rapidly rising in parts of the world where aids is widespread .
drugs are available , but they are gradually becoming less effective as the bacterium becomes resistant to them .
so there is an urgent need for new lines of treatment .
now , researchers at the university of wales in aberystwyth say they have found one .
genome breakthrough the key was an international research project which sequenced the tb genome - work conducted at the wellcome trust 's sanger centre , cambridge , uk , and at the institut pasteur , paris , france .
when the aberystwyth researchers examined the sequence , they discovered that tb contains a gene that is also found in the kinds of fungi which infect humans .
there are already anti-fungal drugs called azoles , which work by blocking this gene .
the researchers tried giving these drugs to a close relative of tb in the laboratory , and found that they killed it .
price problem they are now starting experiments with tb itself .
if the drugs do work here , the researchers will have found a completely new way of attacking this tough bacterium .
and as azoles are already widely used , far fewer safety trials will be needed than with new drugs .
the problem area could be price - several of these drugs are still under patent , and according to the world health organisation , even those which are not are still priced too highly for the poorest parts of the world .

we have fulfilled all the main chapters of this law sok an , head of taskforce the legislation was passed with 86 members of parliament out of 88 supporting the new laws .
the cambodian government and the united nations have worked together on plans for the unique tribunal that would have both cambodian and un-appointed judges and prosecutors .
almost every cambodian family lost relatives to the regime the long-delayed legislation still has to go through the cambodian senate and to be approved by king norodom sihanouk .
after that it will be examined by the un to determine whether it meets international legal standards .
" i think this law will not return back to this place again , " said sok an , head of the government 's taskforce for drafting the legislation .
" i see that there are no more obstacles because we have fulfilled all the main chapters of this law and everybody has agreed . "
judge richard goldstone , former chief prosecutor at the international war crimes tribunals for rwanda and the former yugoslavia , told the bbc it was essential to ensure the tribunal was not politically driven , and had the confidence of the cambodian people .
slow process if the un approves the law , a memorandum of understanding will be signed with the cambodian government and the tribunal can move forward .
cambodia and the un agreed in april 2000 on a formula to try former khmer rouge leaders - blamed for some 1.7 million deaths during their 1975-79 " killing fields " regime .
but the process has made little real progress since .
legislation to create the special tribunal was on the verge of approval by king sihanouk back in february , but prime minister hun sen had wanted all references to the death penalty removed .
commitment doubts cambodia abolished the death penalty nearly a decade ago with its new constitution and the maximum punishment was changed to life in prison .
the delays have led many observers to question cambodia 's commitment to holding a trial with un participation .
a khmer rouge trial is a divisive issue in cambodia where many former leaders of the regime live free , protected by a government amnesty given in return for laying down their weapons and ending decades of civil war .

deaths linked to ecstasy are at a record high , with the rate of people dying after taking the drug almost trebling so far this year .
ecstasy is one of the most pernicious and damaging drugs available dr michael morgan but some experts are claiming these statistics mask another threat posed by the drug to a far wider range of people .
the risk of dying after taking a tablet is one in a million - but the chances of long term mental illness after regular use are thought to be much higher .
one in ten could be affected .
dr michael morgan , of sussex university , has carried out new research which looks into serotonin levels in the brains of people who regularly take e. serotonin is the body 's natural chemical which lifts a person 's mood .
re-evaluation as a result of his studies , dr morgan says we need to completely re-evaluate our understanding of ecstasy , which is regularly taken by around half a million people in britain .
" in the early nineties , it was thought of as a soft drug , analogous to cannabis but we now know that ecstasy is one of the worst drugs in terms of its long term harm potential .
" it is more neurotoxic to the serotonin system than any other drug we know , and this kind of permanent brain damage is something you do n't see with other drugs .
" ecstasy is one of the most pernicious and damaging drugs available - and at the same time the second most popular drug in use .
it 's a major issue " anecdotal evidence anecdotal evidence may support dr morgan 's findings .
we spoke to one ecstasy user who had taken ecstasy nearly every weekend for six years from the age of 13 .
i would end up in casualty three times a week because i thought i was dying ecstasy user she started to suffer panic attacks and severe depression .
" i would end up in casualty three times a week because i thought i was dying - my mum had to sleep in my bed for a year .

deaths linked to ecstasy are at a record high , with the rate of people dying after taking the drug almost trebling so far this year .
ecstasy is one of the most pernicious and damaging drugs available dr michael morgan but some experts are claiming these statistics mask another threat posed by the drug to a far wider range of people .
the risk of dying after taking a tablet is one in a million - but the chances of long term mental illness after regular use are thought to be much higher .
one in ten could be affected .
dr michael morgan , of sussex university , has carried out new research which looks into serotonin levels in the brains of people who regularly take e. serotonin is the body 's natural chemical which lifts a person 's mood .
re-evaluation as a result of his studies , dr morgan says we need to completely re-evaluate our understanding of ecstasy , which is regularly taken by around half a million people in britain .
" in the early nineties , it was thought of as a soft drug , analogous to cannabis but we now know that ecstasy is one of the worst drugs in terms of its long term harm potential .
" it is more neurotoxic to the serotonin system than any other drug we know , and this kind of permanent brain damage is something you do n't see with other drugs .
" ecstasy is one of the most pernicious and damaging drugs available - and at the same time the second most popular drug in use .
it 's a major issue " anecdotal evidence anecdotal evidence may support dr morgan 's findings .
we spoke to one ecstasy user who had taken ecstasy nearly every weekend for six years from the age of 13 .
i would end up in casualty three times a week because i thought i was dying ecstasy user she started to suffer panic attacks and severe depression .
" i would end up in casualty three times a week because i thought i was dying - my mum had to sleep in my bed for a year .

michael ancram and david davis tied for last place in the five-way contest on tuesday , but neither were prepared to stand down .
first round votes michael portillo - 49 iain duncan smith - 39 ken clarke - 36 david davis - 21 michael ancram - 21 mr davis and mr ancram will also step up the lobbying of parliamentary colleagues knowing a single defection could mean the difference between staying in or being thrown out of the contest .
as expected , frontrunner michael portillo topped the poll - with 49 out of the 166 votes cast in the initial knock-out ballot of all tory mps .
there have been calls within the party for a change to the contest rules amid suggestions tuesday 's result will further dent the tories ' image .
result defended but mr ancram , former party chairman , insisted it showed they were democratic .
" we have been campaigning on serious issues , we 've been doing it in a very dignified way , there has n't been a lot of sniping at each other and i think that 's very important .
i think it 's very important that we show we are a democratic party , that we do take our leadership election seriously michael ancram " what we now need to do ... is to spend the next 48 hours putting our case and i intend to do that and to come through . "
defending his decision to fight on , mr ancram claimed his appeal on a unity platform was gaining momentum .
asked about the result mr portillo said : " it 's exactly in line with our predictions and our canvassing . "
he added : " i have always been convinced i can win but i have also always known this is a choice for the conservative party . "
endorsement iain duncan smith came second to mr portillo with 39 votes , followed closely by ken clarke on 36 .
mr ancram and mr davis came joint fourth with 21 votes each .
by thursday , he might be like goran ivanisevic and win the whole thing peter bottomley on michael ancram 's candidature after the result was declared , mr davis said he had received a lot of support from grassroots tories .
" we are going to carry on .
the pressure that has come is from the grassroots tories , " he said .
mr ancram insisted the number of votes he polled was an " endorsement " of his leadership campaign .
carrying on peter bottomley , one of michael ancram 's supporters , said his contender had received 75 % more support than people were predicting on tuesday morning .
" by thursday , he might be like goran ivanisevic and win the whole thing , " said mr bottomley .
mr duncan smith said his 39 votes had exceeded all predictions .
" i believe now we have the momentum to go on and possibly win this competition , i hope , " he told bbc news .
former chancellor ken clarke suggested that support for mr portillo was " falling away " .
" i think i can pick up sufficient support to overtake iain duncan smith , " he said .
final round he said neither of the fourth place candidates could win the overall contest and he predicted he would make it into the final round of voting by party members and go on to win .
asked if the inability of the tory mps to choose between the candidates was farcical , he insisted : " it shows there is life in the old party yet . "
if thursday 's ballot again produces a tie for last place , both candidates will be ejected from the contest .
one or two further knock-out ballots will then take place until two candidates remain .
party members across the country will choose the winner in a postal vote .
their choice will be announced on 12 september , allowing the winner three weeks to get into his stride before making his leadership debut at the party 's annual conference in october .

the cabinet office said in a monthly report submitted to a meeting of economic ministers on wednesday that corporate profits showed no signs of growth .
last week the bank of japan 's quarterly tankan business confidence survey found that companies expect a 7.5 % year-on-year fall in profits during the six months to september .
it is now widely believed that japan is in recession , with its exporters hit hard by the slowdown in the united states .
government response much depends on the response of the government .
the new prime minister , junichiro koizumi has said the report " is not good " .
" there is no growth without reform , " mr koizumi added .
he has promised a new approach , saying he is prepared to risk even more pain in order to tackle the country 's underlying problems .
retail woes sogo department store chain collapsed with massive debts the town of kisarazu across the bay from tokyo used to be a thriving port and industrial centre .

the latest blow came last year when the sogo department store chain collapsed with massive debts .

in many of japan 's major cities , signs of hardship are not immediately apparent , but the economic malaise is clearly taking its toll here .
kisarazu used to be the commercial hub of the entire region , but the closure of the main department stores knocked the heart out of the town .
businesses are moving out and land prices are falling .
it is a pattern that could be repeated across japan .
public spending for 10 years , the government has kept the economy afloat with massive spending on public works .
an elaborate tunnel and bridge combination was supposed to revitalise the region around kisarazu .
but it is getting little use - because of exorbitant tolls .
if anything it is drawing shoppers in the wrong direction - back towards tokyo .
the prime minister , mr koizumi has won enormous popularity with his calls for economic reform .
he says he is prepared to risk more bankruptcies and higher unemployment for the sake of long-term gain , but clearly there are risks .
the government faces a delicate balancing act .
if it gets things wrong and plunges the economy deeper into recession , the misery in places like this could become much more widespread .

the prime minister , mr koizumi has won enormous popularity with his calls for economic reform .
he says he is prepared to risk more bankruptcies and higher unemployment for the sake of long-term gain , but clearly there are risks .
the government faces a delicate balancing act .
if it gets things wrong and plunges the economy deeper into recession , the misery in places like this could become much more widespread .

the study by the markle foundation found that 83 % of americans online had a positive view of the internet , but they also worried about their privacy , about the quality of information on the internet and about violent and sexual content online .
and americans also fear that they do not share the same protections online as they do offline .
the study found that internet users in the us believe that co-operation between industries , the government and non-profits will be necessary to address their concerns .
conflicting feelings the study found that americans are very positive about the internet in general , with 63 % of americans in general and 83 % of those online holding a positive view of the internet .
however , the study found that 45 % of americans view the internet as " a source of worry . "
some 70 % of respondents said that they questioned what they read on the internet slightly more than half , 54 % said that they do not believe they enjoy the same rights online as they do offline and almost 60 % say if they had a problem online , they would not know who to turn to .
but in addressing these concerns , the report concludes that americans want to go beyond black-and-white distinctions between government regulation versus industry self-regulation .
of those polled , 60 % said that rules for the internet should mostly be determined by organisations other than the government , but 58 % of respondents said that they do not want to rely on industry self-regulation alone .
' digital schizophrenia ' the results of the study come as the us congress is considering a number of bills that could have a dramatic impact on the internet .
this coincides with a study which says that a majority of americans believe that the government should develop rules that protect internet users .
the bills congress is debating include : whether to continue the moratorium on internet taxation whether and how to revamp regulations to increase the availability of high-speed connections to the internet and how to protect the privacy of internet users .
adam thierer of the cato institute , a free-market think tank , said that the report in many ways muddies the waters in these policy debates .

hearings against failed businessman george speight and 12 alleged accomplices have been set to begin on 31 august .
nationalist rebels led by mr speight seized parliament on 19 may last year and took ethnic-indian prime minister mahendra chaudhry and his government hostage for 56 days in a racially motivated uprising .
earlier on wednesday the fiji government was given the legal go-ahead to hold a general election , which will coincide with the treason trial , to choose a government to replace the one ousted in the uprising .
deal legal teams representing the government , mr speight and his co-defendants struck a surprise deal that they would bypass a pre-trial hearing of evidence which was already underway .
all 13 could face the death sentence , although capital punishment has not been carried out in fiji since 1970 .
the pre-trial hearing was expected to hear evidence from more than 250 witnesses and to last up to four months .
but mr speight 's lawyers are said to be eager to begin the trial proper in order to challenge the withdrawal of an amnesty which was originally granted to mr speight and his supporters in exchange for the release of their hostages .
the amnesty was withdrawn after the rebels broke one of the deal 's conditions that they return all their arms .
mr speight 's first appearance in court will be in the middle of fiji 's general election , the legality of which has been challenged by a local lobby group .
instability earlier on wednesday high court justice john scott rejected calls that the election plan should be scrapped .
since the bloody coup in may 2000 , the political situation in the pacific nation remains fragile , with racial fears entrenched and tribal power struggles unresolved .
justice scott agreed that a delay in elections " would create a wholly unacceptable risk to the peace and welfare of the nation " .
democracy returns the government said last week that it would go ahead with elections - set for 25 august to 1 september - regardless .
the legality of the move had been challenged by the citizen 's constitutional forum , which asked the high court to scrap the election plan and replace the military-backed interim government with mr chaudhry 's administration .
the result of the general election could overturn the results of mr speight 's coup which succeeded in scrapping the country 's multi-ethnic constitution and installing a new government made up entirely of ethnic-fijian politicians .
the country 's indian population was brought to fiji by british colonists more than 100 years ago .
it makes up 44 % of fiji 's 800,000 population and has come to dominate key industries .
mr speight has argued that the coup was driven by " not so much a hate of the indians , but -lrb- by -rrb- a fear of our host culture and everything unique about ourselves being eroded to the extent that it could be lost " .

prince charles spoke of the need to " expand the minds and fire the imagination " of children .
" none of us can underestimate the importance of books in an age dominated by the computer screen and the constant wish for immediate gratification , " he added .
the prince was speaking at a reception hosted by the millennium commission at the british museum in london to recognise a project that distributes literary classics to school libraries .
he called for the scheme to be extended to the performing arts .
" why ca n't the millennium commission or the lottery think about an even more imaginative scheme which would enable many more children to witness the best theatre , music and other performing arts ? " he said .
' amazing value ' " we have got the money through the lottery , i think many new generations of schoolchildren would be allowed access .
