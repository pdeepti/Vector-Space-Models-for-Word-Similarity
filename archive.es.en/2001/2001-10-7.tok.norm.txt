domestic focus in the article mr blair outlined the case for sending british troops into action against osama bin laden and his allies .
he wrote : " if we failed to act the risk is simple and direct : more british lives lost through terrorism . "
he went on : " attacks in the past , in europe at least , have been thwarted by our security forces .
" but in the end , real success will only come from eradicating the network of terror behind the september 11 attacks . "
but he also went on to reassure that labour 's election promises on domestic policies would not be overshadowed by the international crisis .
" i never forget why we were re-elected : to deliver economic stability , tackle crime and get better public services , schools and hospitals first , " he wrote .
" my focus and that of the cabinet is always on that . "

" the taleban regime have had now three weeks when it 's been made quite clear what they have to do to avoid being targeted . "
mr blair said his tour - which had taken him to russia , pakistan and india - had convinced the global coalition of an " inter-connection " between chief suspect osama bin laden and the taleban .
and he said there was no longer " insufficient world consensus " about taking action against the taleban .
" the taleban have had several weeks in which to respond , they have known what they have to do - and what has become clear in the discussions i have had in the region is that the links between bin laden and the taleban are enormous . "
on saturday us president george bush also appeared to be hardening his stance , warning the taleban that " time is running out " .

neville ray , 67 , of southsea , hampshire , said sales of the flowmizer device will net him his first million over the next five years if demand continues to rise .
the former heating engineer retired seven years ago and spent years trying to find a backer for the energy saving product .
but a chance business encounter resulted in the help of a corporate finance firm .
energy saving the heating system saves water and energy by providing an instant supply of hot water from the tap without the need to run off cold water .
the system cuts costs by maintaining the temperature of water in the water tank , so it is not heated from cold , and reduces the amount of expensive copper piping needed for radiators .
mr ray , who has set up his own firm called rayflow developments , said his experience in the heating industry had given him the idea .
" being of a mechanical background i started pondering over my many years in the heating industry and wondering if there was anything that i could do to help improve the saving of water , energy and the environment . "
chance meeting whilst trying to find backers for the idea mr ray and his wife joyce took up house-sitting , to earn extra cash and give them time to work on the product .
it was during a house-sitting job that their financial problems were solved .
while looking after one property mr ray met the owner who put him in touch with a finance firm which auctioned the invention .
the first flowmizer was installed two years ago and the product is now used by local authorities , housing associations and in the private sector .

in its war against terrorism , the us-led coalition has emphasised the importance of delivering aid for afghanistan 's snowballing humanitarian crisis .
donor governments have now pledged more than $ 600m in aid , to fund what is increasingly seen as a crisis of epic proportions .
deliveries are difficult because of bad roads emergency resources are quickly arriving in pakistan .
but with borders on afghanistan sealed , aid agencies are looking at the swelling number of people inside afghanistan needing help .
after a three-week political impasse with afghanistan 's ruling taleban , the world food programme now says it is trucking almost 800 tonnes of food into afghanistan every day .
further wfp convoys have crossed into afghanistan via turkmenistan and pakistan .
aid hampered by the taleban but the taleban are obstructing operations by banning local staff from using international communication equipment .
the wfp says the taleban have also blocked 1,650 tonnes of food stocks in kandahar .
oxfam operations have also been reduced by more than 50 % because of restricted security guarantees .
many of afghanistan 's roads are expected to be impassable within six weeks , which wfp estimates will cut off 100,000 families from food deliveries .
its distribution in hazarajat and shahr-e-bozurg has been limited to 120,000 beneficiaries , down from 270,000 before the terror strikes in the us on 11 september .
wfp hopes to deliver 52,000 tonnes of food aid each month and plans to restock warehouses before winter makes aid transportation significantly more difficult .
but targeting what has been described as " hunger belt " zones - mostly in northern regions of balkh and faryab and central regions of bamyan , wardak and ghor - already poses problems .
click here for map of refugee movements urban populations moving into rural regions will complicate the logistics of any mass food distribution as starving families travel further to claim relief .
already non-existent road surfaces in afghanistan will soften into deep muddy trenches hampering regional transportation plans .
100,000 families cut off many of afghanistan 's roads are expected to be impassable within six weeks , which wfp estimates will cut off 100,000 families from food deliveries .
this will not affect afghanistan 's slow and rutted transport arteries .
roads like those from turkmenistan to herat , peshawar to kabul , quetta to kandahar , are likely to be open to aid convoys .
thousands of families might not receive food aid but the other end of distribution networks will be narrowed by the effects of winter causing the creation of aid bottlenecks .
at the very least trucks may be substituted by donkeys laden with food sacks along well-trodden paths .
although this maintains trickles of aid into isolated regions , distribution reach is massively curtailed .
problematic air drops agencies are also looking at organising food drops in regions where security can not be guaranteed and roads are blocked .
but supplying assistance by air is complicated by afghanistan 's notorious landmine problem - the number of which is estimated at over ten million by the un .
whilst areas can be targeted to a rough degree , there is no guarantee of accuracy .
more importantly air security guarantees would be needed from afghan authorities .
us military officials have suggested that air drops would have to be preceded by air strikes on taleban positions .
recovering air relief causes other problems .
the logistics of transferring pallets from drop zones to distribution points are time-consuming tests .
air drops would be fraught with difficulties agencies need permission to operate drop zones to ensure proper targeting , otherwise relief can , literally , fall into the wrong hands .
most agencies , including the world food programme and oxfam , have pulled their expatriate personnel out of afghanistan , leaving local staff to continue with distribution projects .
afghan staff are more vulnerable than expatriates , and will find it difficult to fight against demands from regional and military authorities .

former foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind has registered his concerns over the appointment of bill cash as shadow attorney general .
he describes that appointment as " surprising and disturbing . "
in the first part of a serialisation in the scotland on sunday newspaper , sir malcolm also describes mr duncan smith as coming across as too serious and not particularly charismatic .
his comments come as mr duncan smith prepares to make his keynote speech at his first party conference as leader .
iain duncan smith : " intensely serious " mr duncan smith was elected leader of the party after defeating ken clarke in the race to replace william hague .
sir malcolm said that where the public considered former leader mr hague as lacking in gravitas , the new leader " if anything has too much .
he is a very serious figure " .
sir malcolm writes : " he comes across as an intensely serious person .
" he looks worried all the time .
he chooses his words very carefully .
' party opinion ' " that creates some problems for him in terms of charisma , in terms of excitement and personality , but what it does n't do is create an impression of someone who is frivolous and the public probably like that in a potential prime minister .
" how decisive that will prove in terms of the overall public judgement is it too early to say . "
sir malcolm goes on to say that it is in mr duncan smith 's interest to achieve unity in the party .
he writes in scotland on sunday : " that means acting in a way that will attract the support of the whole spectrum of party opinion .
like labour , the tories will not win from simply one end of the political spectrum sir malcolm rifkind " that has been done in the past by all our successful leaders so i was more than surprised by the shadow ministerial appointment of bill cash : i was surprised and disturbed .
" i understand it was made partly to shut him up as far as public comments on europe are concerned .
" if this is the case the public will be well served , but i feel sorry for the shadow cabinet who will have to continue listening to him .
" whoever is leader of the party has to lead a party in which all points of view are represented and that must be done in substance , not just in symbols .
" like labour , the tories will not win from simply one end of the political spectrum . "
