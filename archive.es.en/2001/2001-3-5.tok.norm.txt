mr lopez murphy is a conservative , american-trained economist and former defence minister popular with the markets .
the keenly awaited announcement follows two days of intensive discussions after the resignation on friday of the previous minister , jose lois machinea , who had been criticised for failing to lift the economy out of a 30-month recession .
the president is looking for a minister with the profile necessary to enact his goals : economic recovery , growth and more employment ricardo ostuni , presidential spokesman mr de la rua also announced that argentina 's controversial currency peg to the dollar , credited with helping to stamp out hyperinflation in the 1980s , would remain .
on saturday , the president asked his entire government to resign to allow him a free hand to reshuffle posts - but has since said no new appointments will be announced for several days .
his spokesman said that mr machinea 's successor would need to be someone capable of " kick-starting the economy , boosting growth and winning back jobs " .
in early january , international lenders unveiled a bail-out package worth almost $ 40bn , but it has so far failed to restore growth .
unemployment is currently running at 15 % .
investors mr de la rua 's only other reshuffle of his 15-month presidency was last october when vice-president carlos alvarez resigned , revealing cracks in the ruling coalition .
analysts say the current shake-up comes at a key time for argentina , which , because of its large foreign debt , is sensitive to investor sentiment abroad .
investors have become increasingly sceptical of the government 's ability to revive the economy .
their mood has not been helped by a money-laundering scandal involving the head of the central bank .
two other factors undermining investor confidence are the uncertain outlook of the us economy , and concerns that argentina could be vulnerable to fallout from turkey 's financial crisis .

the bomber was among the four who died in the israeli coastal city of netanya .
about 45 people were injured in the attack .
it 's clear they -lsb- the palestinian authority -rsb- are not taking any steps to prevent it ariel sharon no organisation has admitted responsibility for the attack , although suspicion is falling on the militant palestinian organisation hamas following recent threats - allegations rejected by a close aide to mr arafat .
at the same time hospital officials have reported the death of another palestinian in a gun battle with israeli forces in the west bank .
arafat accused mr sharon told israeli radio that some of mr arafat 's closest aides were participating in the attacks , and he accused the palestinian leader of doing nothing to stop them .
" we know very well that the most loyal forces of arafat are involved in attacks , " he was quoted as saying .
the device exploded shortly before 0900 -lsb- 0700 gmt -rsb- in a crowded open-air market in the centre of netanya .
most of the casualties were israelis .
police commissioner shlomo aharonishki said the bomber was among a group of people standing at a pedestrian crossing opposite the city 's central bus station when the explosive detonated .
the bomb was relatively small and was carried in a carrier bag , the commissioner told israel radio .
but the force of the blast hurled a car into the air , and nearby shops were damaged .
enraged israelis set upon and critically wounded a palestinian in an attempted lynching to avenge the attack , police said .
" after the explosion , a number of minorities -lrb- arabs -rrb- fled to the market and some of the people of the market tried to attack them , " assistant commander aharon franco told israel radio .
" a police force that arrived swiftly at the scene managed to prevent a lynching ... even though one was seriously wounded and taken to hospital , " he said .
ground shook one witness said he saw two police vans rushing toward the scene of the blast just before the bomb went off .
2001 bombs 4 march netanya , three dead 1 march taxi in northern israel , one dead 8 february two car bombs in ultra-orthodox area of west jerusalem 1 january hamas bomb injures at least 36 in netanya " then i heard a loud explosion and the ground shook under me , " israel tv cameraman kobi lahamish said .
another witness , meir mayos , was filling up his car at a nearby petrol station .
" there was smoke everywhere , " he said .
" i saw two people lying on the ground .
i went to give them first aid but they were dead . "
