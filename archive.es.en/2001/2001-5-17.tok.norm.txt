united nations ' sanctions have been in place for 11 years , since iraqi president saddam hussein invaded kuwait in 1990 .
under a draft resolution to be circulated at the un security council next week , iraq would be able to trade commercial goods freely , but strict checks of anything considered to be military or weapons-related would remain in place .
iraq would also be able to resume civilian flights .
the proposals have received a positive response from two other permanent members of the security council , russia and china , according to british officials .
the us and britain have often been at odds with these countries over policy on iraq , and their support is essential if any changes are to be approved .
us review the proposals are the result of a review of policy towards iraq conducted by the new bush administration and discussions among members of the security council .
this will mean iraq will be free to meet all its legitimate civilian needs ...
but controls will be retained , hopefully with a renewed and strengthened international consensus british official the idea is to incorporate the changes into the regular six-monthly resolution renewing the arrangement under which iraq is allowed to buy food , medicine and other supplies under what 's called oil-for-food .
this time , british officials say , the resolution due at the beginning of june would in effect remove sanctions from what they call ordinary imports into iraq .
controls would remain on a list of weapons-related items .
control of oil revenues bbc diplomatic correspondent barnaby mason says the changes are significant , moving from a system where iraq can not import anything unless it is permitted , to one where it can import everything except what is prohibited .
it is not known how many items will be on the banned list .
existing security council resolutions remain in place , and the relaxation would have to be renewed like the oil-for-food programme every six months .
the us and britain are also insisting on maintaining the controls on iraq 's oil revenues , which have to be paid into a special un account .
but london and washington want to ensure that by allowing free trade in all civilian goods , president saddam hussein will no longer be able to accuse the west of being responsible for the suffering of his people .
as part of a wider un security review , efforts will also be made to tighten border controls on iraq .
however baghdad has already warned its neighbours , jordan and turkey , not to co-operate - or it will cut off oil exports to them .
