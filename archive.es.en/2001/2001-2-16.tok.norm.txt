a bbc 5live investigation has found that in the past two years the number of couples willing to make the trip to america and pay up to $ 5,000 for an egg has tripled .
in the uk , where the practice of egg buying is illegal , couples can wait several years for a suitable donor to become available .
but the more relaxed regulatory system in the us allows couples to be more selective about the donor , choosing a woman with desirable looks , background and good health history .
the emergence of the net has made the whole procedure so much easier , with couples able to browse prospective donors online .
internet details for some childless couples , the chances of having a baby depend on them securing an egg from a donor which can fertilised in vitro before being implanted in the womb .
but in the uk , where fertility treatments are highly regulated , this can mean a wait of up to three years before a suitable egg becomes available on the anonymous donor programme .
now , british couples are turning in growing numbers to the united states , particularly california , where it is legal to buy and sell eggs .
information on donors , including pictures and educational details , is posted on the internet by agencies .
the cost of the procedure can reach $ 20,000 uk couples can search this information and select a donor before flying out to america to have the egg implanted .
the eggs themselves can be priced as high as $ 5,000 but legal and other costs will push the final bill for the trip up $ 20,000 .
according to the us agencies servicing this growing british market , up to 60 % of the couples return pregnant to the uk .
the human fertilisation and embryology authority -lrb- hfea -rrb- , which oversees infertility matters in the uk , said it was aware that many more couples were choosing to fly to america to secure their treatment .
positive effects it expressed concern at how relaxed regulations were in some us states and for the lack of protection for the couples involved in the egg trade .
critics of the us system have questioned the ethics of the egg market .
they say it encourages couples to try to engineer the perfect baby .
certainly , the agencies themselves are quite open about the desire to give the new child the best genetic start in life .
lyne mackline , of egg donation inc , said : " i tell couples when they are looking for a donor , whatever the husband 's family has a challenge in , be it depression , alcoholism , obesity , we do n't want a donor with any of those issues because we do n't want to have double indemnity for having very unsuccessful genetics . "
shelley smith runs the egg donor and surrogacy program in los angeles .
she said : " the advent of the internet and the ability to go online and view a little bit of information and a photograph of donors has started to make couples picky .
they have become a little bit obsessed with what a donor looks like and what her qualities are . "
but shauna , a 24-year-old donor , said the openness of the us programmes had very positive effects .
she is even happy to meet the couples who will have her eggs .
" why not have all this information ?
you can share this with the child later on .
' yes , i met the woman who gave her eggs to help me have you and she was beautiful and she had a wonderful smile and light laughter ' .
" i would think anybody would want that experience . "

it follows the us navy 's admission that two civilians were at the controls of the nuclear-powered uss greenville when it collided with the fishing vessel ehime maru .
japan has sent an envoy to the us to seek a full explanation of the circumstances surrounding the accident .
senior vice-foreign minister sishiro eto will demand that search operations continue for nine people who were on on board the ehime maru and are still missing , presumed dead .
mr bush said : " i 'm deeply sorry about the accident that took place , our nation is sorry that the accident happened , and we will do everything we can to help recover the bodies . "
a bbc correspondent says the incident is rapidly turning into a diplomatic disaster for the president , who had hoped to strengthen military ties with japan following a catalogue of incidents involving us troops based on okinawa island .
the civilians aboard the uss greeneville deny that they had distracted the crew and contributed to the sinking of the japanese vessel .
john hall , one of 16 civilians on a visit to the submarine , told the show that the captain had asked him if he would like to pull the levers to execute a rapid resurfacing procedure .
he said as the submarine rose out of the water , he could feel the nose come down .
" just when it was starting to come down ... there was a very loud noise and the entire submarine shuddered . "
according to mr hall , submarine captain commander scott waddle , said " jesus , what the hell was that ? " , before looking through the periscope and saying they had hit a boat .
mr hall said the crew had surveyed the area with a periscope several times before rising .
he remembered " a lot of crewmen calling out to -lrb- the commander -rrb- that they had gone through their procedure and the procedures were okay " .
a preliminary naval investigation into the collision is drawing to a close and is expected to be presented to fleet commander admiral thomas fargo within the next few days .
admiral fargo will decide whether court-martials should be held in connection with the accident .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- political funding law in force low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk politics front page world uk uk politics interviews business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's shaun ley " foreign donations to the main parties ... are banned from today " real 56k friday , 16 february , 2001 , 06:10 gmt political funding law in force a limit has been set on general election campaign budgets political parties will have to disclose publicly donations of more than £ 5,000 under regulations coming into force on friday .
the rules , which will be enforced by a newly established electoral commission , also ban foreign donations and limit the amount each party can spend on a general election .
the political parties , elections and referendum act implements recommendations made by the neill committee to combat " sleaze " .
bernie ecclestone 's £ 1m gift caused trouble for labour it also aims to make the issue of whether sizeable gifts affect party policy more transparent .
in recent months , the labour party has come under pressure to reveal the identity of major donors while the conservatives were criticised for receiving money from belize-based lord ashcroft .
some mps have called for a cap on political donations but that measure is not being proposed as yet .
pressure on labour nor does the reform go as far as in the us where anyone donating as little as five dollars in the presidential election campaign had their details declared on candidates ' websites .
from friday , donations of £ 200 or more will have to be disclosed to the commission while the identity of those giving £ 5,000 or more will be available for public inspection .
for several years labour has listed its donors but not the size of their donations .
however public pressure has forced the issue on occasion .
early this year , publisher lord hamlyn eventually revealed that he was the benefactor who had given a £ 2m sum to labour 's coffers .
formula 1 boss bernie ecclestone 's £ 1m donation to labour in january 1997 proved controversial for the party .
transparency when labour won the election in may that year , the then health secretary frank dobson announced that all sports sponsorship by tobacco companies would be banned .
however six months later , the government announced that f1 would be exempt from the ban , prompting allegations that mr ecclestone 's donation had influenced ministers - although this was strongly denied by the government .
sir sean connery has criticised the ban on foreign donations the bbc 's political correspondent shaun ley said the changes would make it easier for voters to weigh up whether a large gift had affected policy .
" this is the area that it 's not been possible to measure in the past .
" and it 's been the most controversial area for the political parties because of that , " he said .
the tories have also had their share of controversy over the source of their funds .
election limits the british-born tycoon lord ashcroft has given large sums to the party despite being a tax exile , resident in belize .
foreign donations to uk parties are banned from friday but for the next three months , that money can still be given directly to individual candidates .
the ban on overseas money has angered sir sean connery who has donated large amounts to the scottish nationalist party while living in the bahamas .
labour and the conservatives will not be allowed to spend as much on the forthcoming election as they did in 1997 .
at the last election the two parties each spent more than £ 25m .
this time they will be allowed a budget of just £ 15m .
spending limits for referendum campaigns mean only parties which receive more than 30 % of the vote are allowed to spend the maximum £ 5m on their campaigns .

the rules , which will be enforced by a newly established electoral commission , also ban foreign donations and limit the amount each party can spend on a general election .
the political parties , elections and referendum act implements recommendations made by the neill committee to combat " sleaze " .
it also aims to make the issue of whether sizeable gifts affect party policy more transparent .
in recent months , the labour party has come under pressure to reveal the identity of major donors while the conservatives were criticised for receiving money from belize-based lord ashcroft .
some mps have called for a cap on political donations but that measure is not being proposed as yet .
pressure on labour nor does the reform go as far as in the us where anyone donating as little as five dollars in the presidential election campaign had their details declared on candidates ' websites .
from friday , donations of £ 200 or more will have to be disclosed to the commission while the identity of those giving £ 5,000 or more will be available for public inspection .
for several years labour has listed its donors but not the size of their donations .
however public pressure has forced the issue on occasion .
early this year , publisher lord hamlyn eventually revealed that he was the benefactor who had given a £ 2m sum to labour 's coffers .
formula 1 boss bernie ecclestone 's £ 1m donation to labour in january 1997 proved controversial for the party .
transparency when labour won the election in may that year , the then health secretary frank dobson announced that all sports sponsorship by tobacco companies would be banned .
however six months later , the government announced that f1 would be exempt from the ban , prompting allegations that mr ecclestone 's donation had influenced ministers - although this was strongly denied by the government .
the bbc 's political correspondent shaun ley said the changes would make it easier for voters to weigh up whether a large gift had affected policy .
" this is the area that it 's not been possible to measure in the past .
" and it 's been the most controversial area for the political parties because of that , " he said .
the tories have also had their share of controversy over the source of their funds .
election limits the british-born tycoon lord ashcroft has given large sums to the party despite being a tax exile , resident in belize .
foreign donations to uk parties are banned from friday but for the next three months , that money can still be given directly to individual candidates .
the ban on overseas money has angered sir sean connery who has donated large amounts to the scottish nationalist party while living in the bahamas .
labour and the conservatives will not be allowed to spend as much on the forthcoming election as they did in 1997 .
at the last election the two parties each spent more than £ 25m .
this time they will be allowed a budget of just £ 15m .
spending limits for referendum campaigns mean only parties which receive more than 30 % of the vote are allowed to spend the maximum £ 5m on their campaigns .
