detectives have not released details of the man 's identity but it is understood he is not one of the five suspects previously arrested .

he was released on police bail on tuesday night to return to a south london police station on 14 january .
stephen lawrence was stabbed to death by a gang of white youths at a bus stop in eltham in south east london in 1993 .
formal acquittals scotland yard have described their investigation into his killing as " ongoing and vibrant " .
it has been confirmed that a building in south east london was searched on monday by detectives investigating the lawrence murder .
ammunition and a quantity of documents were taken away by officers .
a report on the original police investigation found there had been a catalogue of police errors including inadequate searches , botched identity parades and " institutional racism " .
neil acourt , gary dobson and luke knight were tried at the old bailey but were formally acquitted in april 1996 .
the judge ruled that identification evidence from duwayne brooks , a friend of stephen , was inadmissible .
the case against two other men had been discontinued .
other arrests but metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens insists he knows who the killers are .
the case led to proposals to end the double jeopardy rule which prevents suspects being tried twice for the same crime .

the decision came hard on the heels of news that the country is - so far at least - bucking the gloomy global trend , with gross domestic product leaping 1.1 % between july and september .
for the full year to september , the economy expanded 2.5 % , a sharp spurt after a 1.6 % gain in the year to june .
but announcing its move to a 4.25 % base rate , the sixth cut this year , the reserve bank of australia made it clear that the mismatch might not last long .
housing spending in particular could well flag as part of " the dampening impact on other parts of the economy of global events " in 2002 , said rba governor ian macfarlane in a statement cushioning the blow the rba is hoping that by easing rates now the depth of any future slowdown can be mitigated .
australian consumers have kept spending through the past few months - retail spending was up 1.3 % in october - and the 13.7 % rise in spending on housing has been driven by government home improvement grants .
inflation , however , remains low , and economists generally believe that there may still be room for another rate cut .
" if monetary policy is all about answering the question , ' what is the least worst decision i can make ? ' , then letting unemployment rise is worse than risking the very low inflation rate , " said commonwealth bank chief economist michael blythe .

there are elements in the middle east that hate the thought of peace and will be willing to use terror to derail any type of peace process george w bush in comments that will be seen as providing more support for israeli prime minister ariel sharon , mr bush also called on palestinian leader yasser arafat to " root out those who killed " .
mr bush was speaking after israel said it would continue attacks on palestinian targets in the west bank and gaza strip , in retaliation for the weekend suicide bombings in israel .
just hours later , there was an explosion in central jerusalem - apparently caused by a suicide bomber who blew himself up .
bbc correspondent paul adams , who is staying in a hotel opposite the blast , said he could see what appeared to be the remains of a body lying in the road .
witnesses at the scene said at least three other people were lightly injured in the attack .
mr bush said : " it 's incumbent upon other friends and allies of ours around the world to help bring those terrorists to justice if we want peace in the middle east .
" i think the israeli people want to have peace , but we learned in such a vivid way that there are elements in the middle east that hate the thought of peace and will be willing to use terror to derail any type of peace process . "
mr bush had earlier frozen the assets of a us-based charity and two other groups accused of financing hamas , the islamic militant group that claimed responsibility for the suicide bombings .
tuesday 's israeli air strikes on palestinian targets in the west bank and gaza claimed at least two lives and injured more than 150 , including dozens of schoolchildren .
mr arafat , whose movements have been limited since israel destroyed his helicopters and airport in gaza , escaped injury when missiles hit his ramallah headquarters in the west bank .
the air strikes stopped on tuesday afternoon , possibly due to stormy weather , and it was not clear when they would resume .
but a spokesman for the israeli army , brigadier general ron kitri , said military action would continue until the palestinian leadership took effective action to stop attacks against israeli civilians .
" i think -lsb- the attacks -rsb- will end only when we are convinced that the palestinian authority is doing its duty and fighting terrorism , " general kitri told israel radio .
in his first public statement after the attacks , mr arafat accused mr sharon of trying to torpedo his crackdown on militants .
" they -lsb- the israelis -rsb- do n't want me to succeed and for this he -lsb- mr sharon -rsb- is escalating his military activities against our people , against our towns , against our cities , against our establishments , " mr arafat said .
" he does n't want a peace process to start , " he said .
cabinet rift the latest attacks followed a statement by the israeli cabinet declaring the palestinian authority an " entity that supports terror " .
the declaration has caused a rift in mr sharon 's unity cabinet , with foreign minister shimon peres accusing elements within the government of attempting to bring about the downfall of the palestinian authority .
mr peres , the labor leader , said arafat " should be given a chance , " suggesting that if he were , the palestinian leader would be able to take a stand against militant groups .
the labor party is scheduled to convene on wednesday to decide whether or not to pull out of mr sharon 's wide national unity coalition in light of the military escalation .
palestinian information minister yasser abed rabbo denied mr sharon 's charges of terrorism , saying that israel 's occupation of the west bank and gaza strip was " the source of terrorism " , and that israel 's actions were making the prospects of peace more remote .

alcan workers at rogerstone near newport were told they would be made redundant by 2003 , following a review of the plant .
but a senior tgwu union official said the firm 's claims order books had been hit by the events of 11 september in the us were contestable .
alcan workers face an uncertain time tgwu officer jeff woods claimed the work was simply being moved to plants abroad .
the announcement came exactly a year after the company had said it was make 210 workers redundant .
branch secretary jeff woods said it was a " devastating and bitter blow to the workers . "
" every 12 months , i usually get a christmas card - i seem to be getting threats of job losses every year now .
" as years have gone by , we have changed our skills and trained only to find we are losing hundreds of jobs .
" it 's going to devastate the community ; rogerstone grew on the back of alcan . "
plant commitment he claimed the plant near newport had borne an unfair portion of the company 's international cutbacks .
mr woods said five to seven percent redundancies were promised world-wide while rogerstone was suffering 50 % .
but alcan said the rogerstone plant is on course to make losses of £ 14m this year and said something needed to be done .
we 've had up to 3,200 job losses in 2001 - that 's quite a heavy blow for newport to take all at once carol leslie , newport county borough council a spokeswoman said that , despite the difficulties , the company remained committed to the future of the rogerstone plant .
the company - which has plants worldwide - recently invested £ 20m in its hot mill production facility .
news of the redundancies was broken to workers at lunchtime on tuesday , following talks with management and union leaders .
the job cuts follow the news last month that fellow aluminium company alcoa was to shut its north wales plant at dolgarrog in the conwy valley and its plant in swansea next summer with the loss of 227 jobs .
the alcan workforce is highly-skilled and well paid and the cutbacks will be seen as an economic blow to the area .
a spokeswoman said the factory needed to " refocus " and reduce the number of products and the central business .
economic blow newport county borough council 's carol leslie said : " we 've had up to 3,200 job losses in 2001 - that 's quite a heavy blow for newport to take all at once .
" we 've very much depending on the welsh assembly to come forward with a significant financial package that will stimulate economic regeneration in the area . "
some packages are already being deployed in the region after corus cutbacks , announced in february .
the first 110 alcan jobs will be lost in the middle of 2002 .
the remainder will go by january 2003 .
the cuts will leave just 284 working at the site .
last december , alcan laid off workers when it closed its foiled mill , blaming competition from aboard and the strength of the pound .
the site supplies hot rolled aluminium sheets which are used within europe for everything from kitchen foil to car panels .
alcan said the rogerstone factory would refocus and reduce the number of products being manufactured . watch / listen on this story tgwu 's jeff woods " i 'm getting job loss threats every christmas " bbc wales ' nick palit " a year on , 310 more workers face a bleak future " see also : 04 dec 01 -pipe- wales aluminium plant halves workforce 23 nov 01 -pipe- wales crisis talks on alcoa jobs losses 19 nov 01 -pipe- wales metals firm cuts over 200 jobs 09 nov 01 -pipe- wales airbus suppliers cut 124 jobs 05 oct 01 -pipe- wales unions support plea after jobs blow 04 dec 00 -pipe- wales aluminium plant cuts 220 jobs top wales stories now : soap actor killed in holiday fall wales leads uk bust firms league husband jailed for rape attack festival town prepares for euros plea for more kidney donors rowing team arrives back in uk families opt for single jabs hain turns fire on greens links to more wales stories are at the foot of the page .

managers at plymouth 's derriford hospital want to save money by having offices cleaned just once a week and getting people to empty their own bins .
plymouth hospitals nhs trust said everything was being done to save money to spend on patients .
but surgeons and other medical staff say it is a waste of their time .
staff at derriford were recently sent a memo saying the management board decided to save money by reducing office cleaning .
bins would be emptied once a week instead of once a day .
it said extra black bags would be supplied for people to empty bins in between times and these should be taken to collection points .
some doctors have reacted with concern .
the bbc has been shown e-mails sent between medical staff .
one wrote : " while i understand the trust 's need to save money , i do wonder whether it is good use of consultant time to expect them to empty their own rubbish bins and take black plastic sacks to the nearest collection point . "
a consultant surgeon e-mailed fellow doctors to say : " neither myself nor my overworked and underpaid secretary will be able to clean up the mountain of papers people send me every day . "
another consultant wrote : " the issues facing this trust , in terms of underfunding , are immense and will not be resolved by diverting consultant resource into emptying and disposing of waste . "
he continued ironically : " perhaps the next items for consideration would be that we should take turns at attending the car parks , do a stint at reception , and perhaps turn our hand to a bit of equipment sterilisation . "
plymouth hospitals nhs trust said it had a financial deficit and was trying to make savings in order to safeguard services to patients .
it said reducing office cleaning would save £ 40,000 a year - enough for eight hip replacement operations or the salary of two nurses .
the trust says the new arrangements for office cleaning will , like all such initiatives , be kept under review .

the company , said its chairman richard li , is hoping to save hk $ 190m -lrb- $ 24.4m ; £ 17m -rrb- a year as a " direct result of the extremely difficult economic situation in hong kong and globally " .
pccw bought hong kong 's incumbent telecoms company , hkt , from cable & wireless in august 2000 , but has suffered since as the telecoms market was deregulated ahead of schedule .
at the time , it promised to avoid cutting jobs for 12 months .
pain to come as a result , pccw has been slow to join the rush among hong kong corporations to slim down the payroll .
to date , its only sackings have been 340 people removed from its consumer internet operations in july as the dot.com craze waned .
but now it looks likely that the 506 job losses announced today could be just the start .
" it is not possible to give assurances that there will be no further redundancies , " mr li said in a letter to the company 's 14,000 employees .
unemployment among hong kong 's 6m population rose to 5.5 % between august and october , an 18-month high , with most redundancies in the financial services industry .
boom to bust mr li is one of hong kong 's most high-profile executives .
son of property-to-telecoms tycoon li kashing , pccw was his vehicle for breaking into the big league in the midst of the technology boom of the late 90s .

the company , said its chairman richard li , is hoping to save hk $ 190m -lrb- $ 24.4m ; £ 17m -rrb- a year as a " direct result of the extremely difficult economic situation in hong kong and globally " .
pccw bought hong kong 's incumbent telecoms company , hkt , from cable & wireless in august 2000 , but has suffered since as the telecoms market was deregulated ahead of schedule .
at the time , it promised to avoid cutting jobs for 12 months .
pain to come pccw ran up debt when it swallowed c & w hkt as a result , pccw has been slow to join the rush among hong kong corporations to slim down the payroll .
to date , its only sackings have been 340 people removed from its consumer internet operations in july as the dot.com craze waned .
but now it looks likely that the 506 job losses announced today could be just the start .
" it is not possible to give assurances that there will be no further redundancies , " mr li said in a letter to the company 's 14,000 employees .
unemployment among hong kong 's 6m population rose to 5.5 % between august and october , an 18-month high , with most redundancies in the financial services industry .
boom to bust mr li is one of hong kong 's most high-profile executives .
son of property-to-telecoms tycoon li kashing , pccw was his vehicle for breaking into the big league in the midst of the technology boom of the late 90s .
the company 's meteoric rise was capped by the purchase of hkt .
but the slide in tech valuations since last year means that pccw is the worst performing blue-chip in hong kong 's hang seng index , having slumped 56 % in the year so far .
