with joseph barbera , hanna was the dominant force in american cartooning for more than half a century , creating tom and jerrry - which won a record seven academy awards .
in the sixties , the pair moved into television , created series after series which appealed to children and parents alike .
the flintstones , the jetsons , wacky races , top cat and inch-high private eye were all products of the studio with which hanna remained involved until his death .
teaming up born in new mexico in 1910 , william hanna studied engineering , but lost his job in the depression .
as he could draw , he found work in cartoon production on the west coast .
in 1930 , he joined harmon-ising studios , which created the looney tunes and merrie melodies cartoon series .
but his big break came when he moved to mgm in 1937 .
within a month , he had teamed up with joseph barbera and the greatest team in american cartooning was born .
their first production - puss gets the boot - was prophetic , winning an oscar nomination .
impressed by their success , mgm let the pair develop the cat and mouse theme , leading to the tom and jerry series .
they hit on the formula of an almost silent cartoon , in which the story was told by action rather than dialogue .
yabba dabba doo !
after mgm closed its animation division in the 1950s , hanna and barbera moved into tv , founding their own company - hanna-barbera - in 1957 .
three years later , fred flintstone and his sidekick barney rubble appeared for the first time , a parody of the film the honeymooners .
after the stone age , they tried the space age with the jetsons .
many others followed : yogi bear , based on the phil silvers character sergeant bilko ; wacky races with dick dastardly and his sniggering hound mutley ; top cat , the hair bear bunch , and hong kong phooey .
hanna-barbera produced over 3,000 half-hour tv animations , winning eight emmys .
their company was bought up by warner brothers in 1996 , but william hanna continued to be involved in its work until his death .
he is survived by his wife violet , two children and seven grandchildren .

sources close to sleaze watchdog elizabeth filkin have told the bbc that unless mps are not more willing to assist her inquiries in the future she will need extra powers to compel them .
last week the standards and privileges committee criticised europe minister keith vaz for not co-operating fully with the inquiry by ms filkin into 18 complaints about his business affairs .
despite the code of conduct demanding that mps should co-operate with the commissioner for standards , the publication of evidence from the inquiry into mr vaz showed ms filkin was prevented from finishing her investigations against him .
only one minor complaint was upheld , but nine others could not be investigated fully because of difficulties gathering evidence .
mr vaz 's solicitors had written to the commissioner and said their client did not want to answer any further questions from her .
frustrated the source said that ms filkin is frustrated that the cross-party committee on standards failed to follow her calls for further investigation and disciplinary action against mr vaz .
she is said to believe it would be inappropriate for mps to follow his example and draw on legal advice in an inquiry as if facing a court of law .
the bbc has been told this would be at odds with the honesty parliament itself expects of its members .
the standards committee decided not to follow ms filkin 's recommendations for further action to be taken against mr vaz .
but sources close to the commissioner have said that if the committee draws different conclusions to the public and the press about an mp 's conduct , it could be said that self-regulation by mps does not work .

a survey of 82 authorities found that just 6 % were in support of congestion charges , with 8 % backing fees for parking at work .
the study by the institution of civil engineers , shown exclusively to bbc radio five live , said that many authorities saw road pricing as " electoral suicide " .
the institution believes that charging motorists is an essential tool in the fight against congestion , and accuses local authorities of putting election success before long-term strategy .
road improvements the idea of charging people for driving into towns and parking at work was initially supported by many local authorities .
the profits were to go on improvements in local transport .
london 's congestion charging scheme is due to start in 2003 , but elsewhere support has largely disappeared , says the report .
london mayor ken livingstone wants to charge drivers £ 5 a day to enter the centre of the capital - or face a £ 100 fine .
the government 's road charging options for london report suggests such a scheme would reduce traffic by around 12 % .
integrated transport it could also raise more than £ 200m towards improvements in london 's public transport system .
it is hoped it will pave the way for an integrated transport system , balancing the use of public transport with the car .
but elsewhere in the country , transport planners say alternatives to driving must come in before charges can be levied , and they are waiting to see if the government will provide the funding .

the council fears its appeal for several million pounds of public funding may be overlooked following the resignation of culture and environment minister sam galbraith .
the authority held talks with mr galbraith last month , and now wants to ensure that his decision to quit the post on health grounds does not slow down the process .
in a letter to first minister henry mcleish , culture convenor liz cameron launches a fresh appeal for support and says she hopes the museums will remain a priority .
msps have backed the council 's calls she has also appealed to allan wilson msp , who was mr galbraith 's deputy .
he is now solely responsible for culture and directly answerable to the first minister .
an audit of glasgow 's 13 museums - which house the largest civic collection in the uk - is currently being carried out .
the £ 17m annual bill for maintaining the museums is left at the door of the city council .
they are among the most popular free tourist attractions in the uk , with kelvingrove alone attracting more than a million visitors every year .
the city council hopes to prove that they also contain works of national significance .
special status if so , they may be entitled to financial help with the running of the services .
in january , 19 msps gave their backing to the council 's calls .
they said they wanted to see the attractions given special status and assisted funding from the government .
in september 1999 , a £ 2.7m grants package was awarded to england 's major museums and galleries .
that led to a call for similar help in scotland .
unlike glasgow , edinburgh is given " national " status and therefore qualifies for funding similar to that handed out in england .

pro-mir demonstrator in russian , the word " mir " means both " peace " and " world " , and some russians have reacted as though both will now come to an end with the death of the space station .
bbc correspondent paul moss , who watched one of the numerous demonstrations appealing to the government for a last-minute reprieve , got a hostile reaction from the mainly elderly people braving moscow 's sub-zero temperatures .
" if we lose this station we just lose our position in the world - many other countries do n't treat us as a big power , " one said .

mir nostalgia there have also been many reflective column inches in the nation 's press , and probably a few private tears .
mir nostalgia comes in different forms . "
in a country where nostalgia is an undisputed feature of the national character , the end of mir prompts tears for times gone by " segodnya one is the kind that might come with the loss of a much-loved , though decrepit , family car - or the death of a family friend , as one cosmonaut 's wife put it .
another is the memory of a more idealistic age when cosmonauts were heroes , soviet space technology was a world leader and duty and patriotism meant more than money .
there is also the nostalgia for a lost fortune - because when mir was made , even if citizens were not rich , the state had money .
and everyone now knows that money determines everything .
one of the last cosmonauts on mir , alexander kaleri , said recently : " if it all depended on us , those of us in the space industry would do everything we could to save the station .
but we ca n't do anything without money . "
american diktat he conceded that russia had called the shots on mir , and that the americans may well dictate the rules of the game on the international space station . "
godspeed , mir , and we salute you " the moscow times in the media , other cosmonauts have been remembering the pranks they used to play , and their superstitions .
journalists , too , appear to have been affected by the sombre mood , and are perhaps feeling remorse about all the reports they have filed about mir 's decline .
" over the last few years , much of the western press coverage of mir has had a distinctly uncharitable , almost juvenile flavour .
the world has , almost gleefully at times , reported the station 's dotage , allowing its glory days to fade virtually to oblivion , " wrote the english-language moscow times , in an editorial this week .
descending firebird " and the simple fact is that mir is a tremendous accomplishment , a milestone in the history of exploration and science , as well as a laudable start to truly international space exploration . "
on friday , most russian papers featured the ditching of the mir space station on their front pages .
" at eight in the morning , after switching on its engines for the last time , the mir station will enter the earth 's atmosphere and descend like a firebird , losing its wings in flight , " said moskovsky komsomolets .
but some found something positive to report .
" it 's a paradox , but even the ditching of mir has strengthened the reputation of russian space exploration , " said vremya novostey .

maff vets said the animals are being put down because of " dangerous contacts " with an outbreak at peterstow , near ross-on-wye .
the animals belong to farms just across the monmouthshire border and it is understood they belong to a farming family who also deal in sheep .
meanwhile , farmers on anglesey are waiting to find out if they face a mass cull of sheep to prevent the further spread of foot-and-mouth on the island .
union leaders have accepted that a cull is inevitable on the island , which is the worst-hit area in wales , with 12 cases so far .
they have said they want the slaughter over and done with as soon as possible .
the farmers union of wales has reacted with dismay at news that the outbreak is unlikely to peak until may at the earliest .
however , the decision to cull will be taken on the basis of tests carried out to assess how the virus has spread so far .
the total number in wales now stands at 34 , with three new cases in powys at upper wern-y-pentre , clyro , and llanynys in builth wells , and church stoke .
the latest outbreak in anglesey is at a farm at tyddyn isaf in llangaffo and brings the number of confirmed cases of the virus there to 12 .
until now , foot-and-mouth cases on the island have been confined to an abattoir and individual farms .
but now it has reached common land on the coast where tens of thousands of sheep are grazing .
welsh assembly agriculture minister carwyn jones has held discussions with the army logistics experts in brecon to see whether they could assist with the cull of animals in montgomeryshire .
he is also now considering the use of troops to dispose of carcasses .
we must always listen to the best scientific advice possible , and if that advice is to order a cull then we must comply bob parry , fuw president after attending crisis talks with the prime minister and the farming unions he said : " we 've had assurances that where help was needed from the army we need only ask . "
mr jones said " excellent progress " had been made on the welfare disposal scheme for animal and compensation payments for farmers who have lost animals .
as the number of confirmed cases increases across wales , steps are being taken to re-open the countryside .
the museum of welsh life at st fagans and welsh mountain zoo in colwyn bay have re-opened after several weeks that have seen mounting losses .
the museum has signed up to the tourism charter aimed at allowing attractions in non-infected areas to operate as normal without increasing the spread of the disease .
tourism employs 100,000 people in wales - about 10 % of the workforce - and pumps £ 2bn a year into the economy .

" the economic consequences of that in the uk are enormous and may happen in other member states as well . "
troops move in the fight against the disease in the uk stepped up as army troops moved into dumfries and galloway to help with the mass slaughter of animals .
they will help with the planning and logistics of the pre-emptive cull of 200,000 apparently healthy sheep in the region .
prime minister tony blair is expected to use an eu economic summit to appeal for more continental vets to join the fight against foot-and-mouth .
he flew to sweden on thursday night for the talks which are taking place in stockholm .
mr blair is also expected to use the opportunity to try and sell britain abroad .
chief veterinary officers from the european union are meeting in brussels to discuss the question of vaccinating animals against foot-and-mouth disease .
dutch vets are expected to press for emergency vaccination , saying that earlier reasons for not carrying out a mass vaccination are no longer valid .
eu law agreed 15 years ago prohibits vaccination as it believes the disadvantages far outweigh the benefits .
on thursday the uk government unveiled a £ 150m compensation scheme to help farmers who lose healthy animals .
agriculture minister nick brown announced a fixed rate of " generous tariffs " to farmers for the value of animals left stranded by the disease .
look at the consequences of not having the capacity to identify the movements of sheep like this david byrne farmers will be paid up to 90 % of market value for animals , with them typically receiving £ 81 for a breeding ewe and £ 42 for a new season 's lamb , mr brown said .
the republic of ireland reported its first case of foot-and-mouth disease in county louth , by the border with northern ireland .
irish prime minister bertie ahern said two samples from a flock of sheep at proleek , near ravensdale , in county louth , had tested positive for the livestock virus .
the slaughter of farm animals began in the irish republic on thursday evening .
a temporary ban on all irish exports of live animals and animal products was also announced .
the outbreak has been connected with northern ireland 's only confirmed case of the disease at meigh in south armagh .
the republic was the fourth european country infected by the livestock virus .
the other nations affected are the netherlands and france .

hanratty 's body was reburied in carpenders park cemetery , near bushey in hertfordshire , on thursday afternoon , five hours after it was removed so that a dna sample could be taken .
friends and relatives of the convicted killer , including his brother michael and his wife , attended an hour-long memorial service at the graveside as the body was reburied .
hanratty was hanged in 1962 after being found guilty of murdering scientist michael gregsten , 36 , and raping his lover valerie storie , 22 .
the responsibility for the cry for justice has been passed on from father to son father peter fellows police believe dna recovered from bone samples will prove hanratty was guilty , despite his denials and those of his relatives .
the result of the forensic test is not expected to be made public until the court of appeal hears the case later in the year .
the body of hanratty 's aunt , annie cunningham , was also removed from the plot they shared and taken to a chapel of rest .
father peter fellows , who conducted the service , said it had been a " moving experience " , but was difficult for the family .
he said : " the family have held this for 40 years .
the responsibility for the cry for justice has been passed on from father to son and they did find it extremely difficult .
" they must find a way of going forward no matter what the outcome might be .
" it will be very difficult but i believe it is possible and they will have a lot of support from the community . "
a metropolitan police spokeswoman said the operation had gone according to plan , although the exhumation had taken longer than expected because the grave was waterlogged .
about 20 police and forensic experts took part in the operation , and digging was carried out by a handful of cemetery staff .
protested innocence hanratty , 25 when he died , protested his innocence until his death and his family has been attempting to clear his name ever since .
the killer forced mr gregsten and ms storie to drive from maidenhead in berkshire to a lay-by on the a6 at deadman 's hill in bedfordshire before shooting them .
hanratty claimed he was not present at the murder scene on 22 august , 1961 , but was 250 miles away in rhyl , north wales .
hanratty 's mother and brother have both given dna samples to enable a comparison with traces of dna found on valerie storie 's underwear and a handkerchief wrapped around the murder weapon .
the comparison showed a match .
another match on hanratty 's remains could provide compelling evidence of his guilt .
but his family say the results are meaningless because of the possibility of contamination since 1961 .
the criminal cases review commission referred the case back to the court of appeal to review new scientific evidence , including dna .
home secretary jack straw issued licences for the exhumation earlier this month , after the court of appeal ruled that dna testing would be " in the interests of justice " .

bbc news -pipe- reviews -pipe- manics aim to break mould categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : entertainment : reviews front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 23 march , 2001 , 09:27 gmt manics aim to break mould manics : gritty lo-fi sound by the bbc 's nigel packer for all their fiery rhetoric and rebellious swagger , the manics have always been a musically conservative band .
from the punky thrash of their early days to the bombastic anthems of recent years , they have taken a tried and trusted musical path which seems strangely at odds with their radical agenda .
new album know your enemy sees them making a belated bid to break this mould .
the sloppy funk of miss europa disco dancer shows a much-needed glimpse of humour amid the vitriol it is no kid-a style transformation - more a remixing of old ingredients - as the band face up to the problem of trying to maintain some integrity while filling football stadiums around the world .
spread over 16 tracks , know your enemy is a sprawling and uneven album - with a gritty , lo-fi sound designed to sweep away the cobwebs after the over-produced this is my truth tell me yours .
self-parody this time around they are in more adventurous mood , although the attempts to revisit the " combats-and-eyeliner years " prove to be a mistake .
found that soul and intravenous agnostic are among the more typical blasts from the past , yet both sail dangerously close to self-parody .
and it is not until the album is well into its stride that things start to get more interesting .
so why so sad - a faithful reproduction of the beach boys circa 1966 - hardly represents the future of rock and roll , but it does mark a genuine change of direction for the band .
the same applies to the ragged post-punk groove of wattsville blues , a song with a passing resemblance to the fall .
the sloppy funk of miss europa disco dancer shows a much-needed glimpse of humour amid the vitriol , while the reverb-drenched royal correspondent is equally double-edged .
the band 's lyrics have often proved more original than the leaden rock which accompanies them , and know your enemy is no exception .
determination subjects tackled range from a tribute to actor , singer and political activist paul robeson to an uncompromising commentary on the elian gonzalez controversy .
" america - the devil 's playground , " sneers james dean bradfield on the latter - thus putting paid to any faint possibility of an invite to next year 's grammys .
any group in the manics ' position is in danger of being labelled as little more than a stadium rock band with a conscience .
know your enemy signals their determination to avoid such a fate , although in any meaningful sense it may already be too late .

tony edwards has told the bbc that it was " extremely unlikely " , but that investigations were continuing .
sheep are very densely populated in wales and they cohabit with cattle in some areas , and if it had been in wales before i would have expected the cattle to show signs chief vet for wales tony edwards his response followed news that a sheep dealer in the south-west of england bought animals from a welsh farmer and sold them to france .
the animals were later found to have been carrying foot-and-mouth antibodies .
" there is no evidence that the disease was in wales before , " he said , speaking on the today programme .
" we are investigating with the french exactly what the chain of events was that led to this .
" i know that the clinical signs are difficult to spot in sheep sometimes , but where they are in close proximity to cattle , the cattle show signs very quickly and the signs are unmistakeable . "
" sheep are very densely populated in wales and they cohabit with cattle in some areas , and if it had been in wales before i would have expected the cattle to show signs . "
farmers are still observing strict hygiene precautions mr edwards said it could have been possible that the welsh sheep acquired the antibodies after getting mixed up with animals from elsewhere - as several other shipments went over to france immediately after the disease was discovered in england .
meanwhile a mass cull of 10,000 sheep and 500 cattle is underway at farms on the welsh border with herefordshire .
maff vets said the animals are being put down because of " dangerous contacts " with an outbreak at peterstow , near ross-on-wye .
the animals belong to farms just across the monmouthshire border and it is understood they belong to a farming family who also deal in sheep .
worst-hit meanwhile , farmers on anglesey are waiting to find out if they face a mass cull of sheep to prevent the further spread of foot-and-mouth on the island .
union leaders have accepted that a cull is inevitable on the island , which is the worst-hit area in wales , with 12 cases so far .
they have said they want the slaughter over and done with as soon as possible .
the farmers union of wales has reacted with dismay at news that the outbreak is unlikely to peak until may at the earliest .
however , the decision to cull will be taken on the basis of tests carried out to assess how the virus has spread so far .
the total number in wales now stands at 34 , with three new cases in powys at upper wern-y-pentre , clyro , and llanynys in builth wells , and church stoke .
the latest outbreak in anglesey is at a farm at tyddyn isaf in llangaffo and brings the number of confirmed cases of the virus there to 12 .
until now , foot-and-mouth cases on the island have been confined to an abattoir and individual farms .
but now it has reached common land on the coast where tens of thousands of sheep are grazing .
welsh assembly agriculture minister carwyn jones has held discussions with the army logistics experts in brecon to see whether they could assist with the cull of animals in montgomeryshire .
he is also now considering the use of troops to dispose of carcasses .

in any foot-and-mouth outbreak there is always the possibility , if not pressure , for ring vaccination around infected zones to prevent further transmission .
put simply , ring vaccination is the vaccination of animals not identified as having contracted the disease , but who are within a designated area where outbreaks have occurred .
the use of ring vaccination in the netherlands outbreak has once again begged the question : should we embark on such a policy in the uk ?
before looking in detail at the uk , we should note the following about the dutch situation .
ring vaccination can only be effective in containing the outbreak if there is no animal movement beyond the area professor joe brownlie the outbreak there is strictly limited and therefore much easier to isolate by ring vaccination .
the dutch do not have highland farms with wandering livestock .
there is less movement of livestock from farm to farm in the netherlands .
back to the uk : ring vaccination was one of the recommendations made in the northumberland report into the 1967 outbreak in the uk , and it makes interesting reading now .
temporary immunity " -lsb- slaughter -rsb- policy by itself should be adopted only if the conditions of meat import policy are such as to reduce substantially the risks of primary outbreaks occurring .
" if not , we would recommend the slaughter policy should be reinforced by a ring vaccination scheme . "
such schemes have been used before in outbreaks - though never in the uk - and have been considered a successful adjunct to control in local areas .
it would be difficult to see where ring vaccination could have helped in the initial phase of this outbreak professor joe brownlie this is how ring vaccination works : obviously , it takes two to three weeks after the first vaccination to initiate protective immunity .
with the use of high potency vaccine , immunity to aerosol challenge can occur within four days .
this immunity is temporary and needs a booster inoculation at three-four weeks to provide a longer term protection .
thus for ring vaccination , a single inoculation may be sufficient for a short duration .
sheep movements however , with the present strain of the disease in the uk , -lrb- fmdv o-panasia -rrb- there appears to be limited spread through the air from sheep .
it should be remembered that it is not possible to fully protect pigs by vaccination .
there may still be a case for strategic vaccination of endangered animals professor joe brownlie it is clear that ring vaccination can only be effective in containing the outbreak if there is no animal movement beyond the area of ring vaccination .
with the identification of outbreaks in the first seven days in essex , northumberland , devon , wiltshire and anglesey , ring vaccination could not have controlled this national spread of virus .
it is already clear from maff reporting that widespread sheep movements and marketing have been central to the epidemiology .
that being said , the subsequent two weeks have shown an even greater increase in disease locations across the uk , with particular enlargement of the cumbrian and devon outbreaks .
in retrospect , it would be difficult to see where ring vaccination could have helped in the initial phase of this outbreak .
strategic vaccination there may still be a case for strategic vaccination of endangered animals -lrb- such as the chillingham herd and zoo animals -rrb- , but the political consequences may be prohibitive .
the value of selective vaccination around or downwind of large pig units may also be suggested .
the use of vaccines extends the interval between the last fmd case and retrieving our foot-and-mouth disease-free status professor joe brownlie the northumberland report considered general foot-and-mouth disease vaccination of all susceptible animals in the uk untenable , but proposed that in future there may be a role for ring vaccination .
in the first three weeks of this outbreak , it would appear that any ring vaccination would have had little influence on the extraordinary spread of the virus by the transport and marketing of sheep throughout the uk .
even if ring vaccination were to be introduced now , it would almost certainly be necessary to return to a stamping out policy later , to regain foot-and-mouth disease-free country status .
the use of vaccines extends the interval between the last fmd case and retrieving our foot-and-mouth disease-free status from three to 12 months and possibly as long as two years .
thus , it appears once again that the essential elements to control the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak are the availability of professionals in the field , the rapidity of diagnosis , informed policy - and courage at the top .

sheep movements however , with the present strain of the disease in the uk , -lrb- fmdv o-panasia -rrb- there appears to be limited spread through the air from sheep .
it should be remembered that it is not possible to fully protect pigs by vaccination .
there may still be a case for strategic vaccination of endangered animals professor joe brownlie it is clear that ring vaccination can only be effective in containing the outbreak if there is no animal movement beyond the area of ring vaccination .
with the identification of outbreaks in the first seven days in essex , northumberland , devon , wiltshire and anglesey , ring vaccination could not have controlled this national spread of virus .
it is already clear from maff reporting that widespread sheep movements and marketing have been central to the epidemiology .
that being said , the subsequent two weeks have shown an even greater increase in disease locations across the uk , with particular enlargement of the cumbrian and devon outbreaks .
in retrospect , it would be difficult to see where ring vaccination could have helped in the initial phase of this outbreak .
strategic vaccination there may still be a case for strategic vaccination of endangered animals -lrb- such as the chillingham herd and zoo animals -rrb- , but the political consequences may be prohibitive .
the value of selective vaccination around or downwind of large pig units may also be suggested .
the use of vaccines extends the interval between the last fmd case and retrieving our foot-and-mouth disease-free status professor joe brownlie the northumberland report considered general foot-and-mouth disease vaccination of all susceptible animals in the uk untenable , but proposed that in future there may be a role for ring vaccination .
in the first three weeks of this outbreak , it would appear that any ring vaccination would have had little influence on the extraordinary spread of the virus by the transport and marketing of sheep throughout the uk .
even if ring vaccination were to be introduced now , it would almost certainly be necessary to return to a stamping out policy later , to regain foot-and-mouth disease-free country status .
the use of vaccines extends the interval between the last fmd case and retrieving our foot-and-mouth disease-free status from three to 12 months and possibly as long as two years .
thus , it appears once again that the essential elements to control the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak are the availability of professionals in the field , the rapidity of diagnosis , informed policy - and courage at the top .

invest now in improved health in the developing world , and you will reap massive returns later .
it is not only a direct investment in healthier people who are more productive .
you also create a market which , globally , is important dr gro harlem brundtland who that is the message put forward by the who 's boss dr brundtland as she tours the globe to make governments and business people understand that saving the poor can be a profitable enterprise .
" if you invest in health , you increase economic growth and economic development , " dr brundtland said .
and this , she argued , is true both for companies motivated by profits and for struggling nations trying to escape poverty .
" enlightened self interest compels both industrialised country governments and private corporations to do what it takes to drastically reduce the current burden of disease in the developing world , " dr brundtland said .
healthy workers are efficient workers " the people that you have as your staff in your company are of course an investment .
you train them , you need them .
if they are healthy , they will be at work and they will be more productive , " dr brundtland reasoned .
low-cost anti-hiv and aids drugs are essential " so in the same way that you invest in machines and technology and other goods that create your wealth , you certainly have to invest in the people that you have as your staff " .
personnel managers in the political west , which comprises the rich countries in the world , have known this for a long time .
now , says dr brundtland , the message is beginning to reach companies in africa , south america and asia as well .
many european and us companies operating in these regions are beginning to invest in their staff , in their staff 's families , and in the communities in which they work , she said .
new markets " a healthy environment and more healthy staff is an asset for the company .
not only for their image , but even in more complete terms in the way they are able to make profits , " dr brundtland said .
providing access to anti-hiv and aids drugs requires money so investing in health is not about squeezing more work out of labourers in poor countries .
" when poor people continue to be poor , they do n't contribute to the market .
so its not only a direct investment in healthier people who are more productive .
you also create a market which , globally , is important . "
sick africa one such massive market could have been created in africa by tackling malaria as soon as medication and pesticides made this easier .
the failure to do so in the 1970s was a lost opportunity , dr brundtland argued .
" one can calculate that the gdp of africa could have been $ 100bn higher than it is today because the drain on the african economies from malaria alone is immense , " dr brundtland said .
compare that to the estimated $ 1bn per year that the who estimates is required to tackle malaria , and the economic benefits become obvious .
these days , the additional drain of hiv and aids are burdening the african economies .
the consequent loss of young , sometimes educated , people is an economic as well as a human loss .
pharmaceutical industry dr brundtland would like to see the global drugs industry play an important role .
she accepts that they need to retain their intellectual property rights and patents to fund new research .
therefore , she wants the who to work with the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- to develop an international framework where patents are protected in countries where drugs could be sold at a profit .
but these same drugs should be provided for free or at cost to poor countries .
" you still could keep the incentives for the pharmaceutical companies , because those incentives come from the richer markets where people have the ability to pay , " she said .
reaching the poor however , even when drugs are free or very cheap , they often fail to reach the poor people who need them .
the cost of distributing the drugs must be borne by the international community .
and the cash may be on its way : both the european commission and the leaders of the world 's richest countries have now agreed to targets relating to the reduction in disease .
" i would be surprised if we will not see commitments of substantial amounts of funds by the time the g8 leaders meet again in genoa in july , " dr brundtland said .

it has been published by a special task force set up by the government to challenge the world of criminal gangs .
the task force has outlined a co-ordinated strategy to crackdown on such crime and will target the top 20 criminals in a first step towards putting the gangs out of business .
in its first report , the threat to northern ireland society from serious and organised crime , the task force said the gangs " threatened the development of a normal society " in the province , unless they were stopped .
it said 78 groups , involving 400 members , had been identified by police , with the gang 's illegal activities reaping hundreds of millions of pounds each year .
the report also said 43 of the crime gangs had current or historical links to republican or loyalist paramilitary organisations , but 35 had no such known connections .
northern ireland security minister adam ingram , who is heading the task force , said the report shone a light into " the dark side of northern ireland and exposes some of the criminal legacy of the troubles " .
he said publication of the report and a strategy to deal with the threat marked an important step in the process of tackling " the mafia-like virus which infects northern ireland society " .
" this will be a long struggle , " he warned .
" ultimately , the cure for this sickness lies within the grasp of the people of northern ireland .
" it is only through partnership between the public , the members of the task force , and many other interested agencies , that we will begin to rid communities of the criminality which denies them the safety and prosperity they deserve . "
the task force was set up last september by former northern ireland secretary peter mandelson .
he said it would attack the racketeering , smuggling and drug dealing that was feeding the egos and " financing the rump " of paramilitarism .
the report is the first of its kind to pull together and highlight the diversity of organised criminal rackets .
it highlights the huge profits being made by the gangs through smuggling and laundering fuel .
" prolific criminals can be expected to generate tens of thousands of pounds a day from their activity , " said the task force .
last year customs and excise uncovered 13 major fuel laundering plants with the capacity to produce in excess of 40m litres of illegal fuel .
in january two more mixing plants and one laundering plant were dismantled .
