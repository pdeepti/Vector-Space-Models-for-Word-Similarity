the number of heroin addicts on methadone in glasgow has quadrupled in six years .
the programme is now full up - but the health board and local council are divided over what should be done next .
in 1994 , there were around 1,000 heroin addicts in glasgow getting a daily dose of methadone .
that figure has now risen to around 4,000 .
jim coleman : " i think people took their eye off the ball " the treatment for heroin addiction is dispensed from local pharmacies under strict supervision .
the programme is a joint initiative between greater glasgow health board and glasgow city council .
but council leaders are now concerned that the programme has mushroomed without many addicts becoming drug free .
" i think people took their eye off the ball , " said councillor jim coleman .
" it is now widespread across the city .
it has not achieved what it set out to achieve .
it 's not giving addicts an alternative . "
the council and health board are conducting a review to consider those concerns , along with complaints about the numbers of addicts attending certain pharmacies .
but dr tom gilhooley , of the glasgow methadone programme , believes more people should be encouraged to enter the scheme .
benefiting addicts " what we need to do is get them on the programme and retain them on it , " he said .
" once on it , they will commit less crime , and are far less likely to die or end up in prison .
the nature of the treatment is that people do not come off it very often . "
dr laurence gruer of greater glasgow health board said as many as 3,000 more addicts could benefit from the programme .
alex meikle of the west of scotland drugs forum told bbc newsnight scotland that methadone was the first step for addicts in their bid to return to society .
and deputy justice minister iain gray said : " i think many people have come off methadone successfully . "
the review will consider whether the programme is actually benefiting addicts or increasing the strain on already scarce resources .

a blanket ban has also been imposed on all untreated meat , and meat and dairy products , from the four dutch provinces around the affected farms .
foot-and-mouth was confirmed on wednesday at three farms in the east of the netherlands ; more suspected cases are being investigated at a slaughterhouse in the south and at three farms in the east .
the dutch authorities say 18,000 animals will be slaughtered in the next few days to try to contain the outbreak , and vets are to meet on friday to consider a blanket vaccination programme .
many politicians are in favour of such a scheme , but farmers ' union representatives say this would not be in the long-term interests of the industry .
the dutch authorities have also placed a three-day ban on feed and milk transportation across the entire country .
the dutch farmers ' union has set up an emergency centre with staff manning a special advice hotline in deventer , just south of the farms hit by the outbreak .
