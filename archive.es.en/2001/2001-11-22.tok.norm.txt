korea 's economic output , or gdp , grew by 1.2 % in the period , beating expectations and the 0.4 % figure achieved in the previous quarter .
but , at just 1.8 % , the annualised rate is way behind the 9.2 % growth enjoyed this time last year .
the news is , however , an indication that korea may prove more resilient than some of its neighbours as the global economic slowdown starts to hit asia .
signs of hope some observers are now predicting a further improvement .
earlier this week , the korean government launched a stimulus package , agreeing to cut special excise taxes on luxury goods .
the package could unleash 7,000bn won -lrb- £ 3.9bn ; $ 5.5bn -rrb- of extra spending , lawmakers hope .
policymakers have also loosened their grip on companies , trimming back the number of firms subject to regulators ' strictest supervision , in an effort to spur corporate investment .
but economic reform has not been universally popular in korea , and the level of social unrest has been high in the past few months .
spend , spend , spend much now hinges on the development of private consumption , one of the few areas of the korean economy that is still growing relatively strongly .
consumption was 3.4 % in the july to september quarter than a year before , helping compensate for the collapse in global demand for korea 's hi-tech products , notably computer chips .
but fixed business investment declined by 2.9 % year on year despite a solid rise in construction investment - something that could herald bad news in the future .
the government now forecasts 2-3 % growth in gdp this year , down from its previous estimate of 4-5 % , and way off the 10 % -plus levels seen as the economy recovered from the 1997-98 economic crisis .

the west midlands police federation will consider taking the " unprecedented " action against sir edward crew at a meeting on thursday .
the branch chairman , inspector joe tildesley , said the move follows claims of five years of ill-treatment by sir edward towards officers leading to a recruitment crisis in the west midlands .
the dispute reached crisis point last week when the chief constable refused to attend an open meeting of the federation .
' major consequences ' " it would be an unprecedented step to take , " said inspector tildesley .
" it is possible we will pass a vote of no confidence - that would have major consequences for our force . "
inspector tildesley : ' public slap in the face ' he said ordinary officers were fed up of poor treatment by the chief officer .
" morale is at an all-time low , " he said .
" we do n't feel we are appreciated , respected , or valued and feel that we are more harshly treated than any other force on a whole range of issues . "
he said the west midlands force has the highest rate of resignation or transfers to other areas of any force in the country .
a total of 221 officers have resigned or left for other forces in the last 10 months , 3 % of the force 's officers , twice the rate of departures from the metropolitan police .
inspector tildesley said : " we 've had difficulties with sir edward over five years , this is not something that has happened overnight .
' high-handed manner ' " i was appointed to try to make sir edward change his mind but i have been singularly unsuccessful in achieving that over 19 months . "
last week the chief constable failed to make a scheduled appearance at a federation meeting - he told them he would not be attending because inspector tildesley had spoken to the press before the event .
inspector tildesley described the non-appearance as a " public slap in the face for the federation " and " yet another example of the appalling high-handed manner in which we have all been treated . "
the federation has put forward a four-point plan to improve morale .
the scrapping of officers going on the beat on their own .
the withdrawal of officers ' surnames on body armour .
the reintroduction of administrative support for officers .
the separation of community policing and responding to emergencies .
the chief constable declined to comment .

his statement comes as some of the wings in the 192-year-old prison get in-cell electricity for the first time .
governor graham johnson , who took over at the devon jail in june , says the move will help drive it into the 21st century .
he said that the new scheme is being implemented because it will assist in looking after inmates and helping them look at their behaviour .
it is about looking after them properly and helping them stand up and address their behaviour graham johnson , prison governor mr johnson said : " we are looking to increase the facilities available to prisoners and we are bringing in television facilities and other associated equipment for them .
" we have got a whole different generation of prisoners that have grown up stimulated by television and computers games and all that they bring .
" it is not about going soft on them - it is about looking after them properly and helping them stand up and address their behaviour . "
electric power is being installed in some cells to enable the use of tv sets for the first time as part of a major modernisation programme at the jail .
the process of allocating televisions to prisoners began on wednesday .
it has been funded from the existing prison budget , a home office spokesman said .
dartmoor jail can house more than 650 inmates all inmates with " standard " or " enhanced " levels of privileges will get a television in their cells .
they will be able to watch tv programmes whenever they are in their cells and not required for other duties , such as prison work or education , said the spokesman .
access to tv sets in cells is common in english and welsh prisons , where all inmates of these privilege grades will eventually get televisions .
dartmoor prison is due to be downgraded from category b to c in january .
as part of the modernisation , prison workshops will also be reviewed to provide a greater range of vocational courses for inmates .
mr johnson said : " it is about providing meaningful activities .
it gives them some purpose and self-respect , " ' better place ' " if we are to be successful as a category c jail , we need to encourage people to learn from courses and re-enter society in a more positive way than when they entered the jail in the first place .
" my aim is to bring dartmoor into the 21st century and to make it a better place for staff , prisoners and visitors . "
dartmoor prison , which is at princetown , about 16 miles from plymouth , was originally built in 1809 to house french and american prisoners-of-war .

his statement comes as some of the wings in the 192-year-old prison get in-cell electricity for the first time .
governor graham johnson , who took over at the devon jail in june , says the move will help drive it into the 21st century .
he said that the new scheme is being implemented because it will assist in looking after inmates and helping them look at their behaviour .
it is about looking after them properly and helping them stand up and address their behaviour graham johnson , prison governor mr johnson said : " we are looking to increase the facilities available to prisoners and we are bringing in television facilities and other associated equipment for them .
" we have got a whole different generation of prisoners that have grown up stimulated by television and computers games and all that they bring .
" it is not about going soft on them - it is about looking after them properly and helping them stand up and address their behaviour . "
electric power is being installed in some cells to enable the use of tv sets for the first time as part of a major modernisation programme at the jail .
the process of allocating televisions to prisoners began on wednesday .
it has been funded from the existing prison budget , a home office spokesman said .
all inmates with " standard " or " enhanced " levels of privileges will get a television in their cells .
they will be able to watch tv programmes whenever they are in their cells and not required for other duties , such as prison work or education , said the spokesman .
access to tv sets in cells is common in english and welsh prisons , where all inmates of these privilege grades will eventually get televisions .
dartmoor prison is due to be downgraded from category b to c in january .
as part of the modernisation , prison workshops will also be reviewed to provide a greater range of vocational courses for inmates .
mr johnson said : " it is about providing meaningful activities .
it gives them some purpose and self-respect , " ' better place ' " if we are to be successful as a category c jail , we need to encourage people to learn from courses and re-enter society in a more positive way than when they entered the jail in the first place .
" my aim is to bring dartmoor into the 21st century and to make it a better place for staff , prisoners and visitors . "
dartmoor prison , which is at princetown , about 16 miles from plymouth , was originally built in 1809 to house french and american prisoners-of-war .
it became a criminal prison in 1850 and can house more than 650 inmates .

he will also meet northern alliance foreign minister dr abdullah abdullah , who arrived in the iranian capital en route to europe for next week 's conference of rival afghan factions .
it is a chance for the british government to gauge at first hand how cooperative the northern alliance is prepared to be at the united nations-sponsored meeting .
on friday , mr straw will travel on to islamabad to try to secure pakistan 's support for a multi-ethnic afghan government .
this is the second time since the terrorist attacks of 11 september that mr straw has visited iran .
his previous trip was the first by a british foreign secretary since the iranian islamic revolution over 20 years ago .
it is the latest sign that the two-month-old war on terrorism is allowing nations to forge new relationships .
mr straw said the main purpose of his mission to tehran and islamabad was to listen .
he wants both iran and pakistan 's views of the situation on the ground in afghanistan and their assessments of the refugee crisis which both have borne the brunt of .
crucial issue most importantly he said he wanted to know how far they would be prepared to give active support in getting traditionally opposed afghan groups to end hostilities and forge a broad based national government .
with the conference on afghanistan 's future due to start in bonn on monday , it is this last point that is crucial .
that meeting will be the first time rival factions from inside afghanistan and from emigre groups have agreed to sit down together .
just getting them to agree a time and a place for this preliminary meeting has taken weeks of delicate negotiations .
until now pakistan and iran have supported rival afghan factions - iran favouring groups in the northern alliance and pakistan backing the southern pashtun tribes , including for a time the taleban .
but the crisis of 11 september changed all that .
severed ties pakistan has severed its ties with the taleban , and iran has agreed to work together with the united states and its allies in combating terrorism and in trying to bring peace to afghanistan .
and though tehran was vehemently against the american bombing campaign , it has still continued to cooperate .
that alone has been seen as something of a breakthrough and is one of the reasons jack straw is now making his second visit to tehran in less than two months .
but it is collaboration between afghanistan 's neighbours that is seen as the real key .
improved relations diplomatic contacts between iran and pakistan have improved since september - president musharraf even dropped in on tehran on his way to the un general assembly in new york recently .
but as far as afghanistan goes , relations are still uneasy .
iran has let it be known it does not want the former king of afghanistan to take a leading role in any future government , something pakistan has been pushing for .
how far the northern alliance should stay in control of kabul is also disputed .
so is what role , if any , recent defectors from the taleban might play in any peace settlement .
so mr straw 's aim on this trip will be to impress on both countries the need to work together , if afghanistan is not to collapse into conflict again and if next week 's conference is to have any chance of laying the groundwork for a long term settlement .

it was going to happen .
it is not a surprise argentine voter that prospect moved a step closer on wednesday when the former argentine president announced he would run for the post again .
a day earlier he had been released from five months of house arrest imposed over an arms-smuggling scandal to croatia and ecuador in the early 1990s .
mr menem 's supporters have been celebrating wildly ever since the supreme court said there was insufficient evidence in the case .
they insist the ex-president is the only one able to save the country from its economic crisis .
but many voters received news of mr menem 's release with apathy .
in the cafes , they watched the former president 's movements on television without emotion .

corruption claims polls indicate that mr menem does not have wide popular support these days because of persistent accusations of corruption .
there are accusations that he amassed huge personal wealth which allowed him to build a luxury mansion and mountain refuge in his home province of la rioja .
the recession which began in the last two years of his second term also does not help his case .
nevertheless , he should not been written off and in argentina nobody denies his political acumen .
he has strong support in some provinces and people confronted with a bleak future feel nostalgic for the early 1990s when the country was prospering under mr menem 's control .
freedom leaves the former president in a position to reassert his role as argentina 's main opposition leader at a time when president fernando de la rua is growing increasingly unpopular for his handling of the economic crisis .

the company said that sales for the six months to mid-october grew 5.7 % to more than £ 5bn -lrb- $ 7bn -rrb- .
the retailer has now completed an unbroken two-year run of rising sales , signalling that it has recovered well from its mid-1990s slump .
pre-tax profits also rose , climbing by 8 % on the previous six-month period to £ 180m .
that was slightly below the expectations of analysts , most of whom had forecast pre-tax profits of about £ 182m .
recovery plan safeway , like its rival j sainsbury , is mid-way through a store refurbishment programme designed to lure back customers who defected to low-cost competitors over the past two years .
last year , the company scrapped a long-running loyalty card scheme in favour of aggressive price competition as part of a bid to reposition itself .
it is also introducing a new range of in-store services including pharmacies , dry cleaning and pizza ovens .
investors have given safeway 's recovery programme their seal of approval , lifting the company 's share price from a low of 150p in late 1999 to about 350p .
" our strategy is on course and delivering significant performance improvement , " said safeway chairman david webster .

home secretary david blunkett hoped to dissolve opposition to a measure allowing the detention without trial of some terror suspects - by building in an automatic lapse after a five year period .
it 's long been the wish of some of the most gruesome and barbaric regimes in the world to get this government to act against people they deem to be terrorists diane abbott , labour mp but it was not enough to prevent 15 labour rebels voting against an order to opt out of article 5 of the european convention on human rights preventing detention without trial .
the government 's huge majority ensured the vote was easily carried .
but among those opposing the move included chris mullin , labour chairman of the influential home affairs select committee , and labour former minister mark fisher .
legal challenges later , 32 labour mps voted against the government over powers which would prevent legal challenges to the home secretary 's decisions .
mps on all sides of the commons have accused the government of using the terror attacks of 11 september as an excuse to force through draconian measures limiting traditional freedoms .
they are also angry that such a controversial bill is being rushed through in three parliamentary sessions , a process that would normally take several weeks .
the bill is expected to face further opposition when it reaches the lords .
blunkett 's concession it is due to receive its final commons reading next week .
earlier , in an attempt to appease the bill 's critics , mr blunkett told mps there will be a " sunset clause " added to the section of the bill dealing with the detention of suspects without trial .
this means that after five years the measure would lapse and parliament would have to vote to re-approve it .
mr blunkett said it would enable mps and peers to determine whether detention without trial was still justified .
' unacceptable ' labour rebel chris mullin praised the government 's " willingness to listen " on the sunset clause , as his committee had suggested just such a change .
he said it made it easier for mps who 'd had concerns over the anti-terrorism , crime and security bill to support it .
but oliver letwin , the shadow home secretary , called the concession " unacceptable " , as the five-year sunset clause only applied to one section of the bill .
' internment without trial ' mr blunkett 's concession also failed to silence backbench critics such labour 's diane abbott , who said of the government 's plans : " it will look very much like internment without trial .
" it 's long been the wish of some of the most gruesome and barbaric regimes in the world to get this government to act against people they deem to be terrorists .
" they have got their wish in this set of internment clauses . "
internment , she said , had proved the " best recruiting sergeant " for the ira .
' utterly wrong ' the anti-terrorism bill 's committee stage came in the wake of a joint attack on the plans from the conservative party leader and the northern ireland first minister .
iain duncan smith and david trimble argued government risked encouraging terrorists by making a false distinction between osama bin laden and northern ireland paramilitaries .
the pair say the anti-terror bill creates the " utterly wrong " concept of " good " and " bad " terrorists by distinguishing between international and domestic terrorism .
the home office has countered the criticism , saying most of the bill deals with all types of terrorism and only one part specifically targets international terror groups .
in a joint article for wednesday 's daily telegraph newspaper , mr duncan smith and mr trimble - leader of the ulster unionist party - say : " by creating different classes of terrorist , the danger is that all terrorists will be encouraged to believe that , if only they persist , sooner or later they will succeed . "
a tory bid to apply the detention provisions to domestic as well as international terrorists was defeated by 361 to 177 , a government majority of 184 .
