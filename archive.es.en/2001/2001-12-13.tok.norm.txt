the document notes the increased vulnerability of people forced to flee their homes through conflict , who can then become subject to demands for sex by border guards or military personnel .

the fall took analysts by surprise as the country 's unemployment rate fell back below 7 % .
in october , the rate had risen to 7.1 % .
in november , 4,100 new jobs brought it down to 6.7 % .
some analysts had expected a rise to 7.3 % .
observers and politicians alike said the fall is an indication that australia 's economy is performing well despite a dip in world economic growth .
" today 's figures demonstrate that , despite the uncertainty that remains in the international economy , there is considerable underlying strength and resilience in the australian economy and the labour market , " said employment minister tony abbott .
" the good news story of the australian economy keeps rolling on .
these numbers are clearly much better than expected , " said commonwealth bank of australia chief economist michael blythe .
" certainly against the global backdrop the australian economy is operating in at the moment and the particular problems it has had in some industries , employment rising and unemployment falling is a pretty good result . "
in october , almost 18,000 jobs were lost and economists had predicted that a further 10,000 jobs would go in november .
some analysts cautioned about reading too much into the figures .
" my initial impression is that the employment figures are quite encouraging , " said anz investment bank senior treasury economist david de garis .
" but you always have to be careful about monthly data as there 's so much noise from month to month . "

benadetta tagliabue said she was sure that the holyrood building would become something that scots would be proud of .
it emerged on wednesday that the estimated cost of the building - which was designed by the late enric miralles - had increased to just under £ 260m .
a third of that extra £ 18.5m will go into a contingency pot which will be used to speed up the building work in order to get it ready for may 2003 - before the next holyrood elections .

she said : " what i can see is that the quality of the building is really very , very high and i really believe that the buildings are something durable for the future and very very powerful .
" so i believe the cost represents very good value . "
ms tagliabue added that she did not think corners would have to be cut to make sure that the building is ready in time for the 2003 elections .
when the late donald dewar , who was then scottish secretary , suggested that a new building should house the scottish parliament the estimated cost was £ 40m .
buit this quickly escalated and following disclosures of rising costs , a cap of £ 195m was then put on the project .
this was removed following a vote earlier this year by msps .

researchers at the uk 's porton down laboratory estimated the vulnerability of today 's population to smallpox and used historical data from europe and north america to model a modern outbreak .
they concluded the infection would spread rapidly , with each infected individual passing the disease to between six and 12 others .
the infection rate would fall as measures to curb the epidemic were implemented - but before this happened , many would die .
the model produced by the scientists from the wiltshire research centre is published in the journal nature .
terrorist fears smallpox , along with anthrax and the botulism toxin , is regarded as one of the most feared potential bioweapons .
once common throughout the world , the disease was eradicated by 1979 after which routine vaccination gradually ceased .
official stocks of the virus now remain in only two laboratories , in atlanta , georgia , in the united states , and novosibirsk in russia .
however , there is increasing concern that the virus might be held secretly and less securely elsewhere , and could be used as a weapon by terrorists or rogue states .
scientists looked at smallpox outbreaks in the united states and england in the 18th century .
they also examined a yugoslavian epidemic which started in kosovo in 1972 , and went unrecognised until the second generation of infection when vaccination and quarantine procedures were initiated .
risk analysis the researchers analysed the risk , or r value , associated with different outbreaks which corresponded to the average number of people each person with the disease infected .
between the 1700s to the 1900s this tended to be in the range of 3.5 to six , but in particular circumstances - such as crowding or hospital-spread infection - could rise to about 10 to 12 .
the scientists found a clear relationship between the length of delay before control procedures were put in place and the total number of cases .
they wrote : " although our estimate for smallpox represents a relatively modest transmission rate by comparison with some other infectious diseases , such as measles and chickenpox , significant epidemics could result , particularly if there were delays in detecting the first cases or in setting up effective public health interventions .

jo tuffnell is the daughter of sir anthony berry , former mp for enfield southgate and a junior minister in margaret thatcher 's government .
on 12 october 1984 sir anthony was killed , along with four others , by a bomb planted in the grand hotel in brighton , during the tory party conference .
click here to read jo tuffnell 's story in her own words ira bomber patrick magee was convicted of murder and sentenced to 35 years imprisonment , a year after the bombing .
but mrs tuffnell 's journey had , in a sense , already begun .
she says that within days of the attack , she knew she wanted to have the strength to overcome bitterness - and that that might involve meeting the brighton bomber .
nonetheless , magee 's release after just 14 years - as party of the good friday peace agreement - was a profound shock to her .
it is part of my own healing to hear his story jo tuffnell mrs tuffnell , who had already been making trips to ireland to try better to understand the conflict , decided she needed to meet magee .
she pursued the idea of a meeting until he agreed .
on 24 november 2000 the pair met at a secret location in dublin , for what was later described as " highly-charged three hours " .
strange meeting the two of them then agreed to meet again - with the cameras present .
jo tuffnell wanted to overcome bitterness the programme offers a glimpse of the personality dynamics involved in such a strange meeting .
magee , who completed two university degrees in prison , is still a committed republican , inclined to justify the armed struggle against the british .
but he is clearly disarmed , in quite another sense , by the generosity and openness of jo tuffnell .
' pain ' while pointing out how mrs tuffnells ' father was seen as " a legitimate target " , he goes on : " but meeting you reminds me that the was also a human being and he was your father - and that 's all lost . "
sir anthony berry had six children " i think it 's very important to be confronted by the consequences - with your pain , " he tells her .
both of them say that they are surprised by the readiness of the other to try to find some common ground - though their lives could not have been more different .
magee , born in belfast in 1951 , was brought up in norwich but returned to belfast in the early years of the troubles .
soon he was involved in the provisional ira , and later spent two year interned without trial - from where he emerged committed to armed struggle against the british .
by contrast mrs tuffnell was born into the heart of the british establishment .
her parents ' wedding was attended by the queen mother , and her father was a member of the royal household .
repercussions but if it has taken a catastrophe to bring them together , there has emerged a kind of mutual respect and fascination , and during the course of 2001 the pair met several more times with the cameras present .
the meetings have had repercussions in their separate lives , too .

jo tuffnell is the daughter of sir anthony berry , former mp for enfield southgate and a junior minister in margaret thatcher 's government .
on 12 october 1984 sir anthony was killed , along with four others , by a bomb planted in the grand hotel in brighton , during the tory party conference .
click here to read jo tuffnell 's story in her own words ira bomber patrick magee was convicted of murder and sentenced to 35 years imprisonment , a year after the bombing .
but mrs tuffnell 's journey had , in a sense , already begun .
she says that within days of the attack , she knew she wanted to have the strength to overcome bitterness - and that that might involve meeting the brighton bomber .
nonetheless , magee 's release after just 14 years - as party of the good friday peace agreement - was a profound shock to her .
it is part of my own healing to hear his story jo tuffnell mrs tuffnell , who had already been making trips to ireland to try better to understand the conflict , decided she needed to meet magee .
she pursued the idea of a meeting until he agreed .
on 24 november 2000 the pair met at a secret location in dublin , for what was later described as " highly-charged three hours " .
strange meeting the two of them then agreed to meet again - with the cameras present .
the programme offers a glimpse of the personality dynamics involved in such a strange meeting .
magee , who completed two university degrees in prison , is still a committed republican , inclined to justify the armed struggle against the british .
but he is clearly disarmed , in quite another sense , by the generosity and openness of jo tuffnell .
' pain ' while pointing out how mrs tuffnells ' father was seen as " a legitimate target " , he goes on : " but meeting you reminds me that the was also a human being and he was your father - and that 's all lost . "
" i think it 's very important to be confronted by the consequences - with your pain , " he tells her .
both of them say that they are surprised by the readiness of the other to try to find some common ground - though their lives could not have been more different .
magee , born in belfast in 1951 , was brought up in norwich but returned to belfast in the early years of the troubles .
soon he was involved in the provisional ira , and later spent two year interned without trial - from where he emerged committed to armed struggle against the british .
by contrast mrs tuffnell was born into the heart of the british establishment .
her parents ' wedding was attended by the queen mother , and her father was a member of the royal household .
repercussions but if it has taken a catastrophe to bring them together , there has emerged a kind of mutual respect and fascination , and during the course of 2001 the pair met several more times with the cameras present .
the meetings have had repercussions in their separate lives , too .
magee has become actively involved in irish conciliation groups and with facilitating encounters between former " combatants " and victims .
mrs tuffnell became increasingly worried that her search for reconciliation would be seen as disrespectful or disloyal by other brighton victims but when she meets mp harvey thomas - pulled alive from the rubble of the grand hotel - he reassures her that she was not letting her father down : " he 'd be extraordinarily proud of you , " he says .
