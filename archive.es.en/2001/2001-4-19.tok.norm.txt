an estimated 36 million people are living with hiv worldwide .
the epidemic has hit sub-saharan africa the hardest , with more than 25 million people hiv positive in the area .
globally 20 million have already died .
existing hiv therapies are helping , but the great majority of those infected can not afford them .
medical breakthrough needed hiv has affected primarily the young , the mobile , wealthy and better educated parts of the population , the scientists said .
this meant it had a greater impact on a country 's economy than other diseases .
it was estimated that by 2010 south africa 's gross domestic product would be 17 % lower than if there had been no hiv epidemic , they said .
aids has also affected agriculture , household income and education , they added .
some 860,000 children lost their teachers to the disease in 1999 in sub-saharan africa .
the authors said that , as with all major advances with public health , medical breakthroughs as well as changes in social behaviour were needed to combat hiv and aids .
targeting vulnerable groups as well as making money available so everyone could receive treatment was essential .
they concluded that global , national and community initiatives needed to be co-ordinated to tackle the problem .

he said hundreds of thousands of his supporters were now ready to march on the capital , jakarta , to protect him .
the parliament has been irresponsible to the extent that they want to make the president fall down president wahid the threat was made during a speech opening a high-profile conference attended by leading businessmen , policy makers and academics .
already , thousands of president wahid 's supporters have been receiving military-style training in east java , saying they will fight to the death to prevent him being forced out of office .
bbc jakarta correspondent richard galpin says it is a measure of just how serious the political crisis has now become that the president has felt the need to make such a dramatic statement in front of such a prestigious audience .
rebellion against parliament he told the conference his supporters were already moving on the capital and that as of wednesday 400,000 people had proclaimed their loyalty to him from all over java and sumatra .
and this , he said , did not include people in the capital itself .
he described all this as a nationwide rebellion against parliament .
" the parliament has been irresponsible to the extent that they want to make the president fall down , " he said .
in 10 days ' time members of parliament are due to debate whether to issue a second formal censure against mr wahid over the allegations of corruption he is facing .
if that motion is passed , then it will be almost certain that the president will face impeachment proceedings , which could see him thrown out of office within a few months .
' illegal ' moves at present there is no sign that top political leaders will be meeting any time soon to find a peaceful negotiated settlement to this mounting crisis .
so mr wahid 's only strategy to save his presidency seems to be the use of threats and intimidation , correspondents say .
as he again stated in this speech , he believes the attempts to remove him from office are illegal .
he argues that under the present constitution he could only be toppled before the end of his term in 2004 if he committed treason .
" the second memorandum -lrb- of censure -rrb- is unnecessary and wrong ... according to the constitution the president has the right to govern to the end of his term , " he said .
but parliament does not agree and , our correspondent says , it seems a potentially violent confrontation between the two sides is now almost inevitable .

the new army , air force and navy chiefs - jose cacho , miguel medina and luis vargas - vowed to respect civilian authority and rebuild confidence in the ranks .
their predecessors tendered their resignations after the release of videos showing them endorsing mr fujimori 's attempt to seize dictatorial powers in 1992 .
the peruvian congress has recently been releasing videos filmed by former spy chief vladimiro montesinos in march 1999 , in which hundreds of officers are shown signing pledges endorsing the so-called " auto-coup " .
the commanders say they were forced to sign the endorsement document by mr montesinos , who used blackmail in running the armed forces .
corruption web general cacho , who will head the army , had also signed the endorsement , but , because he had a lower rank at the time , it was considered he was forced to sign out of obedience .
