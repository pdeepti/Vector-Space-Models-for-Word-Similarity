lord robertson , who is visiting macedonia , described it as a genuinely democratic state and warned that those who used violence for political ends had to be defeated .
lord robertson -lrb- right -rrb- sees some signs of improvement he said 150 rebels had been arrested and several tonnes of military equipment seized by nato-led peacekeepers in recent days .
correspondents say some western diplomats concede that the macedonian constitution may eventually have to be changed to satisfy albanian demands .
' renewed dialogue ' lord robertson , who was accompanied by the ambassadors of all 19 nato members , said he had seen some signs of improvement since his last visit .
" it 's the second time i 've been here in these last eight days and i see progress already made , " he said .
" there is renewed and intensified dialogue now going on with the political parties here . "
not everyone appreciates nato 's involvement in macedonia lord robertson 's visit follows all-party talks on monday aimed at addressing albanian grievances .
and it coincides with what the army describes as the longest period of calm since the conflict with ethnic albanian rebels began six weeks ago .
the macedonian authorities say they have successfully pushed the rebels across the border into kosovo , but guerrilla commanders maintain they have simply fallen back to regroup .
on tuesday the macedonian government reopened the border with kosovo in an effort to return the area to normal .
demands monday 's talks were attended by the largest ethnic albanian party , the democratic party of albanians -lrb- dpa -rrb- , which is in the governing coalition .
but they were boycotted by the main ethnic albanian opposition party , the party for democratic prosperity .
the leader of the dpa , arben xhaferi , has threatened to pull out of the government unless its demands are met within a month .
he has also warned that the rebels will return if progress is not made .
correspondents say the brief rebellion has changed the political situation in macedonia .
the government now accepts that the grievances of the albanian minority have to be addressed , and the hand of albanian politicians strengthened .

bbc news -pipe- tv and radio -pipe- match delayed for eastenders climax low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : entertainment : tv and radio front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 4 april , 2001 , 05:57 gmt 06:57 uk match delayed for eastenders climax someone 's got a visitor in eastenders ...
the bbc has negotiated a delayed kick-off for a european football match so viewers can find out who shot eastenders ' phil mitchell without missing any of the football action .
uefa cup matches are traditionally screened at 2000 bst when the soap finishes , but a special 40-minute episode means the football fans will have to wait .
the start of the uefa cup semi-final between liverpool and barcelona from the nou camp stadium will begin at 2010bst on thursday , to allow for the soap 's nailbiting finish .
the eastenders storyline has gripped viewers since the former queen victoria landlord was gunned down outside his albert square home five weeks ago .
the nation will be on the edge of its seat bbc spokesman in tuesday 's episode , viewers saw bad guy phil , played by steve mcfadden , discharge himself from hospital after telling godson jamie -lrb- jack ryder -rrb- he knows the identity of his would-be assassin .
after the culprit is revealed on thursday , viewers will be able to take in the big match in spain .
bbc sport spokesman mike hales said : " we asked both sides nicely and they agreed to start later because of eastenders .
" it is a well-known programme so the spanish realise it was important for the bbc . "
suspects phil returned to albert square seeking revenge in tuesday 's episode , and as night came he was seen knocking on a door .
viewers saw all five of the main suspects - steve owen -lrb- martin kemp -rrb- , dan sullivan -lrb- craig fairbrass -rrb- , mark fowler -lrb- todd carty -rrb- , lisa shaw -lrb- lucy benjamin -rrb- and ian beale -lrb- adam woodyatt -rrb- hear callers at their door .
going down : phil 's shooting has gripped viewers the guilty party slowly opened the door and the camera focused on phil , who grinned and said : " guess who . "
the storyline has been billed as the biggest whodunit since the 1980 shooting of oil magnate jr in american soap dallas .
a spokesman for the soap said : " the nation will be on the edge of its seat in this cliff-hanger of all cliff-hangers as we prepare to reveal the guilty party . "
betting the storyline also caused bookmaker william hill to stop taking bets after a flurry of wagers on a character played by former new avengers star gareth hunt , who has yet to appear in the series .
when betting re-opened , ex-girlfriend lisa shaw was favourite with odds of 4/5 .
dan sullivan , who returned to the soap on the eve of the shooting , was the second favourite with odds of 2/1 .
he was also the favourite of bbc news online users in a poll conducted last month .
others suspected by users include phil 's former sister-in-law sharon watts -lrb- letitia dean -rrb- , steve owen 's mother and robbie jackson 's dog , wellard .
