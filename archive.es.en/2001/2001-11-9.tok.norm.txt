the status of the rock , which was seized from spain in 1704 , has been a source of constant anglo-spanish friction .
talks aimed at solving the issue once and for all are to start in two weeks ' time , but the government of gibraltar is boycotting the meeting and accusing the british government of giving too much ground to spain .
friday 's meeting between the two leaders is being viewed in gibraltar with deep unease .
in spite of denials from the british government , there is a suspicion on the rock that the scene is being set for uk concessions when detailed talks on gibraltar 's status begin .
there is enormous anger among the 30,000 inhabitants of the rock at what is seen as britain 's willingness to appease spanish demands .
the uk foreign office minister , peter hain , has called the talks in barcelona a moment of destiny for gibraltar , but he stressed this week that no gibraltarian would be asked to hand over british citizenship unless they freely chose to do so .
the gibraltar government fears that leaves the door open for some kind of joint sovereignty to be declared which would water down the " britishness " of gibraltar .
embarrassment the reason the british and spanish governments are so keen to find a solution is that their ongoing row is a serious hindrance to european union business .
important agreements such as the so-called " open skies pact , " which frees up european air space are being held up because of arguments about whether or not the rock can be included .
the gibraltar issue is an embarrassment to two governments that regard themselves as modern , efficient democracies untainted by past conflicts .

most schools feel that even with the best supply teachers , classes merely " tread water " department for education report a report from think tank the institute for public policy research says the supply teachers are used most in urban secondary schools , where the government is most worried about standards .
the number of " occasional teachers " - on contracts of a month or less - has gone up from 12,200 in 1995 to 19,000 , according to official statistics .
they made up one quarter of the extra 8,000 teachers in schools during the past year .
the institute says this is the biggest aspect of education privatisation .
short-term problems the difficulty in getting teachers to fill vacant full-time posts means schools are increasingly using supply teachers on long-term contracts .
supply teachers , england 1995:12,200 2001:19,000 £ 600m annually £ 43 per pupil this in turn makes it harder for them to find qualified supply teachers for short-term cover , mainly when staff are ill or away on training courses .
the report tends to confirm a trend towards experienced teachers ' giving up the burdens of a full-time job to do supply work .
it offered more flexibility , better working conditions and better pay .
this is despite research showing that supply teachers often are not given information about the school they are in - such as what times the bell rings at , never mind where resources are - and are made to feel unwelcome by children , school administrators , teachers and parents .
cost to schools the department for education 's value for money unit estimates that schools typically spend £ 43 a year per pupil on supply teachers - £ 50.78 for primary schools and £ 32.80 for secondary schools .
i want to teach , but i do n't want to be a teacher supply teacher it also says : " most schools feel that even with the best supply teachers , classes merely ' tread water ' in lessons covered by supply . "
separate official figures show that the amounts spent each year on all books and equipment are £ 103.50 in primary schools and £ 132 in secondaries .
one recruitment analyst estimates schools are now spending more than £ 600m annually on supply teachers - 5.3 % of all spending on teachers .
" although supply teachers are used across the globe , the rapid growth of the supply agency sector is an english phenomenon , " the report says .
policy issues this raises significant policy issues for ministers , say the authors , dara barlin and joe hallgarten .
mr hallgarten said it was a classic example of education policies , economic circumstances and changes in society having an unintended result .
" many supply teachers are performing daily miracles in continuing the learning process for the children who need it the most , " he said .
" however , many are poorly prepared , utilised and managed .
the use of supply teachers seems here to stay and well-researched , progressive policies , are necessary to take account of this change . "
dara barlin said that without changes in policy , supply teaching would continue to provide a better alternative for many teachers .
" this will most likely exacerbate shortages in the permanent teaching sector , and might significantly compromise the education our children are getting . "
report 's recommendations : teachers who have become education consultants , ofsted inspectors or union officials being encouraged to do supply teaching one day a week common regulations for the different types of providers of supply teachers teachers ' ongoing " professional development " training being done outside school hours , in return for overtime pay all heads and deputies to teach on a far more regular basis a new qualification for staff who provide only emergency cover using new technologies to have " virtual " supply teachers .
the head of the association of teachers and lecturers -lrb- atl -rrb- , peter smith , said private sector teacher supply agencies were in business to make a profit , but this came from public money which was lost to the education system .
conditions and checks " whilst the best supply agencies offer flexibility and higher rates of pay , others exploit teachers .
most concerning is evidence that arrangements for police checks are slack union leader peter smith " atl has discovered that pension contributions are not often paid , agency teachers can not pass the threshold to higher rates of pay and training is not available . "
although teacher shortages had driven up the pay supply teachers could command , the rates paid could be very low - in one case a school was paying £ 130 a day to an agency which was paying the teacher only £ 62 .
" most concerning is evidence that arrangements for police checks are slack .
some agencies allow teachers to start before these are completed , or ask teachers to pay for their own police checks . "
mr smith said the problem was that the mechanisms set up to do such checks were unwieldy and were tailored towards permanent staff .
' important role ' " i think the department for education has to come off the fence and say that supply teachers are a fact of life and it 's not enough that they operate by a code , they should be properly regulated .
" there are too many instances of children having been abused for this to be ignored . "
a spokeswoman for the department said : " supply teachers play an important role in the smooth running of schools .
" the government is determined to raise standards and the status of the profession as a whole , whilst addressing the specific needs of supply teachers .
" we have sought new ways to do so , such as the introduction of a quality mark for supply teacher agencies from early next year . "

in a dour assessment of the prospects for any early turnaround , the government in tokyo said that 11 september had been a " turning point " .
economic conditions are very severe ...
external shocks hit japan when the economy was weak heizo tanaka economics minister the government has been virtually the only body still betting on growth for the current financial year from april 2001 to march 2002 .
most other forecasters were already predicting something close to decline well before the attacks on the us .
that view is reinforced by the fact that economy had already shrunk 0.8 % between april and june when compared to the previous year .
what the government now expects is a 0.9 % contraction for the full year , rather than the 1.7 % growth it previously predicted .

in a dour assessment of the prospects for any early turnaround , the government in tokyo said that 11 september had been a " turning point " .
economic conditions are very severe ...
external shocks hit japan when the economy was weak heizo tanaka economics minister the government has been virtually the only body still betting on growth for the current financial year from april 2001 to march 2002 .
most other forecasters were already predicting something close to decline well before the attacks on the us .
that view is reinforced by the fact that economy had already shrunk 0.8 % between april and june when compared to the previous year .

euro mp olivier dupuis and his co-defendants were also ordered to pay fines of two million kip -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- and costs of 5,000 kip -lrb- 50 cents -rrb- after a three-hour trial in the capital , vientiane , on friday .
the other four are italians silvja manzi , bruno mellano and massimo lensi and russian national nikolai kramov .
olivier dupuis represents an italian constituency mr dupuis is belgian , but represents an italian constituency .
a court official told the associated press news agency that the detainees had already been handed over to their embassies .
phaivi siboripha , president of the three-judge panel , said the five had been found guilty of " propaganda against the lao people 's democratic republic " which had " damaged the country 's stability and security " .
they had faced a maximum five years in jail for interfering in laos 's internal affairs .
no political dissent our correspondent says the laotian government appears to have moved swiftly to avoid a diplomatic row with the european union over the detained activists .
laos , which is one of the poorest countries in asia , could ill afford to risk losing any of the overseas aid which funds much of the government 's annual budget .
romano prodi , the president of the european union 's executive commission , warned on thursday that if laos failed to quickly find a satisfactory solution to the case , its relations with the eu would be damaged .
the five are all members of the brussels-based transnational radical party .
they were arrested on 26 october in vientiane after marking the second anniversary of a students ' democracy protest in laos by displaying a banner and handing out leaflets .
human rights groups say at least five lao nationals involved in the 1999 protest are still being held without trial .
the communist regime , which has ruled laos since the end of the vietnam war in 1975 , tolerates no political dissent .
however , there is some armed resistance from ethnic minority groups and over the past year there has been a series of mysterious bomb explosions which the government has blamed on dissidents .
a french lawyer who visited the five europeans at a detention centre on wednesday said that they were in poor health , deprived of medicine and clean drinking water .
klauspeter schmallenbach , head of the european commission delegation based in bangkok in neighbouring thailand , witnessed part of the trial and said the five had appeared calm and " seemed to be relieved " .

euro mp olivier dupuis and his co-defendants were also ordered to pay fines of two million kip -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- and costs of 5,000 kip -lrb- 50 cents -rrb- after a three-hour trial in the capital , vientiane , on friday .
the other four are italians silvja manzi , bruno mellano and massimo lensi and russian national nikolai kramov .
mr dupuis is belgian , but represents an italian constituency .
a court official told the associated press news agency that the detainees had already been handed over to their embassies .
phaivi siboripha , president of the three-judge panel , said the five had been found guilty of " propaganda against the lao people 's democratic republic " which had " damaged the country 's stability and security " .
they had faced a maximum five years in jail for interfering in laos 's internal affairs .
no political dissent our correspondent says the laotian government appears to have moved swiftly to avoid a diplomatic row with the european union over the detained activists .
laos , which is one of the poorest countries in asia , could ill afford to risk losing any of the overseas aid which funds much of the government 's annual budget .
romano prodi , the president of the european union 's executive commission , warned on thursday that if laos failed to quickly find a satisfactory solution to the case , its relations with the eu would be damaged .
the five are all members of the brussels-based transnational radical party .
they were arrested on 26 october in vientiane after marking the second anniversary of a students ' democracy protest in laos by displaying a banner and handing out leaflets .
human rights groups say at least five lao nationals involved in the 1999 protest are still being held without trial .
the communist regime , which has ruled laos since the end of the vietnam war in 1975 , tolerates no political dissent .
however , there is some armed resistance from ethnic minority groups and over the past year there has been a series of mysterious bomb explosions which the government has blamed on dissidents .
a french lawyer who visited the five europeans at a detention centre on wednesday said that they were in poor health , deprived of medicine and clean drinking water .
klauspeter schmallenbach , head of the european commission delegation based in bangkok in neighbouring thailand , witnessed part of the trial and said the five had appeared calm and " seemed to be relieved " .

the five-year plan would move 10 % of the jobs from headquarters in washington to field offices around the us , improve the justice department 's use of technology and making counter-terrorism efforts the top priority of the fbi .
the war on terrorism will not be fought in washington but in the field by agents john ashcroft national security and law enforcement experts say that these reforms are a good start and well needed .
but they add that federal law enforcement still needs to improve the way it works and shares information with local law enforcement , and agents will need to learn that fighting terrorism is very different from fighting ordinary crime .
the reforms have been a long time in coming , especially at the fbi , which has suffered a series of high-profile setbacks such as the discovery shortly before oklahoma bomber timothy mcveigh was to be executed that the fbi had failed to turn over thousands of pages of documents to his attorneys .
" any change is good , " said james lewis with the centre for strategic and international studies .
he said there were three problems facing federal law enforcement , technological , international co-operation and culture and bureaucracy - the inability to share information between the intelligence community and the law enforcement community .
" the changes that mr ashcroft has announced move in that direction , " mr lewis said .
the anti-terrorism bill passed earlier this year would also will help improve sharing of information between intelligence and law enforcement sources .
the role of the office of homeland security is still unclear but he also expressed worries that other initiatives announced since the 11 september attacks might complicate mr ashcroft 's efforts .
one question that mr lewis had was how these reforms fit in with the newly created office of homeland security .
" it 's one of the tensions here , " he said .
and other tensions - some that date back from the formation of the fbi - will also prove difficult to overcome , law enforcement experts say .
" the war on terrorism will not be fought in washington but in the field by agents , " mr ashcroft said in a speech to justice department staff .
local law enforcement officers have the perception that federal law enforcers only give out information when they want to , said robert friedmann , chair of the department of criminal justice at georgia state university .
this is a perception that dates back to before the fbi was created and j edgar hoover ran its predecessor , the bureau of investigations , said gary perlstein , an anti-terrorism expert with portland state university .
complex network more than any other country in the world , the us relies on a complex network of agencies to enforce the law , dr friedmann said .
he said that now , while there is good will amongst these various agencies , is the perfect opportunity to break the barriers down .
mr perlstein is also concerned that the reforms that mr ashcroft announced are largely structural , and although necessary , do not address retooling the fbi for counter-terrorism as opposed to traditional crime enforcement .
a failure of intelligence has often been cited as one of the causes of the 11 september attacks , and mr perlstein said the fbi must be able to get information from within these groups .
poor record mr perlstein added that the fbi had a poor record of infiltrating terrorist organisations .
" the fbi was almost a total failure in catching the weathermen , and they have been almost a total failure in catching the earth liberation front , " he said .
the weathermen were a violent radical group in the 1960s .
the earth liberation front is a radical environmental group that has burned buildings mainly in the western united states to protest against development .
" most criminals are caught because they make a mistake or someone squeals on them , " mr perlstein says .
but he added that to infiltrate and apprehend terrorists , agents will need to be retrained , saying : " methods used to catch regular criminals do not work on terrorists . "
