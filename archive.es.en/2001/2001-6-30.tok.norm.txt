research on rhesus monkeys in the us found the infants of those that were given cocaine had half the number of cells in a key part of the brain than those who were not .
the study 's authors described their findings as a " warning sign " of the drug 's effects on humans .
but british experts said it was difficult to ascertain what the effects on human babies actually was .
this is the first study that clearly shows the possibility that cocaine may affect the brain structure dr michael lidow , university of maryland the research , published in the journal of comparative neurology , was carried out by dr michael lidow and his team from the university of maryland 's neuroscience programme .
they took eight pregnant monkeys and gave half of them 20 milligrammes of cocaine per kilogram of weight every day during the second trimester .
that period of the pregnancy was chosen because it is the time when the cerebral cortex is formed .
it largely controls brain functions such as thought , reasoning , memory , sensation and voluntary muscle movement .
they then studied the brains of the babies born to the monkeys before putting them to sleep at three years of age so that the scientists could analyse their brains .
brain analysis the study found those monkeys whose mothers had been given the drugs had 60 % fewer neurons - brain cells - than those who had not .
and their cerebral cortex was about 20 % smaller .
dr lidow and his team found the cocaine actually stopped the brain cells reaching the cerebral cortex , something that has also been observed in schizophrenic patients .
he said the study showed many of the key cells stayed in the white matter under the cortex .
he said : " this is the first study that clearly shows the possibility that cocaine may affect the brain structure .
it shows that it could happen . "
the researchers say the fact the study was carried out on monkeys meant they could isolate the effects of the drug .
in humans , they say , cocaine 's effect is difficult to study because of other factors such as the use of other drugs and poor diet .
implications for humans dr lidow said : " monkeys are the closest you could get to humans . "
but he admitted further research was needed to see exactly how humans would be affected .
writing in the journal of comparative neurology , dr barry kosofsky from massachusetts general hospital and dr steven hyman from the national institute of mental health said the " evolutionary closeness " of monkeys and humans meant that the findings of this study were likely to be transferable .
" we certainly have enough information to make it a priority to identify and treat addicted individuals who are pregnant and to make serious ameliorative efforts aimed at children , " they said .
leading drugs charity drugscope said the issue of drug use in pregnancy was a very emotive issue .
the danger of being judgmental about drug using pregnant women is that they will be reluctant to seek out the medical help they and their babies need drugscope it said : " the most publicised example has been of ' crack babies ' in america .
" panic stories have often exaggerated the damage done to babies whilst ignoring the fact that most of the mothers were living in very poor and deprived circumstances , factors which themselves are implicated in having a difficult pregnancy and complications in childbirth and for newly born babies .
" the danger of being judgmental about drug-using pregnant women is that they will be reluctant to seek out the medical help they and their babies need . "

it is the first trip by a belgian leader to dr congo since brussels cut off most links with the former president , mobutu sese seko , in the early 1990s .
the congolese government says it is evidence that the country is no longer a pariah state .
mr verhofstadt , who will be guest of honour at saturday 's independence day celebrations , is expected to announce an increase in aid for the beleaguered country , which has been torn apart by war .
prospects for peace he is also expected to express his support for congo 's peace process .
international observers believe that since president joseph kabila succeeded his assassinated father laurent in january , prospects for an end to the civil war have increased .
the visit follows a warming in relations between the two governments .
belgium slashed most of its economic support for congo in 1990 following allegations of a state-sponsored massacre of students .
" we come here without arrogance , without paternalism , and even with great humility , " mr verhofstadt told the french news agency afp .
" we want to act now because there is a real chance to help , in a constructive way , in the renaissance of the congo , " the belgian leader said .
charm offensive the bbc 's correspondent mark dummett , in kinshasa , says the new congo president has been quick to make friends abroad , charming western governments and investors .
kinshasa 's residents have been circulating pamphlets expressing their desire that the many belgian businessmen who fled the country will return .
opposition parties have not been so welcoming .
they are complaining that the visit gives credibility to an unelected leader .
our correspondent says that most of the belgian aid will only be granted in return for assurances that president kabila is committed to lasting peace , a national dialogue and democratic elections .
the belgian delegation is set to meet both the rwandan-backed congolese rally for democracy -lrb- rcd -rrb- and the political opposition .
it will also travel to the rebel-held city of kisangani .
dr congo has been carved up by warring factions , with the government controlling barely half of africa 's third-largest state .

a judge granted her an injunction against the release of a song recorded by cobain with nirvana before his death in 1994 .
the fight is over control of nirvana warren rheaume , attorney for grohl and novoselic love and the two remaining band members , dave grohl and krist novoselic , are in court fighting for control of the studio recording of the song and a 45-track box set designed to commemorate the 10th anniversary of nirvana 's groundbreaking nevermind album .
" the fight is over control of nirvana , " said warren rheaume , the attorney for grohl and novoselic .
love argues the song is not necessary for the success of the box set , which is intended for release on 23 october .
unreleased gem the track , called you know you 're right , is regarded by fans as one of the unreleased gems of nirvana .
people who have heard the january 1994 studio recording of the song agree it could be a big hit .
a 45-second bootleg from a live version of the song can be heard on the band 's fan club internet site .
all sides involved in the dispute agree that the song - with an introduction of " i do n't need to love again / i wo n't sigh and mope again / i do n't need to love again " - would be a fitting final chapter of nirvana 's legacy .
" it 's a spectacular piece of music , " said love 's attorney , o yale lewis .

a trial to resolve the issue has been scheduled for 31 december 2002 .

nirvana ... was the living manifestation of the creative vision , personal will and life force of a single unique individual love 's court documents love and the surviving band members formed a partnership three years after cobain died .
but in the court filings , love said she was " emotionally overwrought and distraught " when she signed the agreement , which splits proceeds from the band 's assets equally among the three .
court documents filed for love downplay the contribution to nirvana by grohl and novoselic .

a jury held colonel ubiratan guimaraes responsible for the killings after he ordered special units to storm latin america 's biggest prison - the carandiru jail in sao paulo - during a riot on 2 october , 1992 .
it is an important message for society that police are not above the law maria luisa mendonca , global justice he was sentenced to 632 years , six years each for the victims and 20 years for five attempted murders , although under brazilian law he will serve a maximum 30-year sentence .
human rights groups welcomed the verdict , which they said would help end impunity for brazil 's notoriously violent police force .
colonel guimaraes , 58 , was originally charged with 111 counts of murder , but prosecutors reduced the charges to 102 , saying there was no evidence police had killed nine men found stabbed to death .
carandiru is latin america 's largest prison after sentencing , colonel guimaraes hugged his lawyers and was escorted from the sao paulo courtroom in tears .

worldwide criticism the photographs of bloodied , naked corpses lined up in prison hallways drew criticism from around the world .

the former yugoslav president , slobodan milosevic , is in custody in the hague where he will become the first former head of state to appear before the international war crimes tribunal .
he will face charges of planning and ordering a campaign of terror , persecution and violence against the kosovo albanians at the end of the 1990s .
his extradition has strained yugoslavia 's governing coalition with yugoslav president vojislav kostunica denouncing the extradition as illegal and unconstitutional .
after handing over mr milosevic , yugoslavia has been promised more than $ 1.2bn in desperately needed financial aid from international donors that is crucial for the country 's economic recovery .
what do you think about the extradition of slobodan milosevic ?
what are the implications for the future of yugoslavia and the balkan region ?
if you are from the former yugoslavia what does this moment mean for you ?
we will be discussing the extradition of slobodan milosevic and the implications for the balkan region on sunday in a talking point phone-in programme broadcast on bbc world service radio and on bbc news online at 1500 bst -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- .
if you would like to take part , please include a telephone number with your comments where we may contact you .
have your say i am ashamed to be a serb , my country has sold out one of its sons .
who cares whether he 's a criminal , we lost our pride and sovereignty .
never has another country sold their leader for 1 billion non-delivered dollars .
draza pizdolizac , ravna gora , yugoslavia thanks to mr milosevic -lrb- but not only him , i agree -rrb- 10 million people spent 12 years suffering , loosing their dearest ones , and their homes .
what is one arrest compared to that ?
with what sentence can dead become alive again ?
but at least , last night mr milosevic and his family spent one sleepless night .
at least that .
zdenka , sarajevo keeping milosevic in serbia would just have made him an eternal obstacle in our lives .
ivan , belgrade , yugoslavia as most young people in serbia , i am glad milosevic finally got extradited .
it was high time we finished with him once and for all .
even after october 5th , he still remained as a shadow clouding our perspectives for the future .
we have endured more than a decade of his ruling .
keeping milosevic in serbia would just have made him an eternal obstacle in our lives .
even though i do n't have a high opinion of the hague tribunal i 'm grateful for having a decisive enough government that decided not to let one man endanger the future of a whole nation ... at least , not any more .
ivan , belgrade , yugoslavia serbia has done the right thing , by sending milosevic to the hague .
i ask you when will croatia , bosnian federation , nato do the same ?
i do n't think croatia will ever send their generals or politicians to the kangaroo court .how many serbs where killed in krajina and how many where forced out of their homes ?
no kangaroo court for the croats milos mihalovic , pristina serbia i 'm thankful milosevic is headed to the hague for the sake of croatia .
not just for vengeance 's sake -lrb- though admittedly that has a part -rrb- , but because it will be easier for the croatian government to extradite its alleged war criminals in the eyes of the croatian public .
when croatia 's general blaskic received his 40 + year sentence it was the first real destabilizer to the new-at-that-time croatian government .
the fact that the primary aggressors were n't being pursued made it difficult for croatia to comply .
now with some serbs on the dock , croatia can flush a few more of its war scum out .
now let 's see them bring in mladic and karazdic and then we 'll have a fairer set of trials in a regional sense .
dk , elkins , nh , usa slobodan is as guilty as a whole host of other figures from east and west who ought to be in the dock with him ivan , zagreb , croatia slobodan is as guilty as a whole host of other figures from east and west who ought to be in the dock with him .
the entire war has been a mired in the filthiest of political smoke and mirrors , arm-twisting and deals -lrb- otherwise known as " diplomacy " -rrb- .
i 'm not convinced that the western powers give a damn what he did , but his removal from power ensures that the west can get on with the business of making sure that serbia is under the west 's thumb .
ivan , zagreb , croatia if anybody should put milosevic on trial it should be the serbs .
and if somebody should extradite someone that would have to be usa , germany , uk , france .
he is responsible for losing territories and serbian lives .
this is the greatest shame in the history of the serbs .
i only know that i could not live with myself if i had to extradite someone like djindjic did .
vladimir , belgrade , serbia the only reason slobodan milosevic was handed over because serbian people accuse him for losing four wars in less than 10 years , not because they think he was responsible for atrocities committed against humanity .
once they hand karadjic and mladic we may say that the serbian people have purged themselves like the germans did after the second world war .
stevica , croatia the call to prayer from the neighbourhood mosque here in sarajevo sounded positively jubilant last night peter , bosnia hercegovina i do n't know if he 's going to get a fair trial ... probably not but i do n't understand why did the prosecutor wanted him so bad in the hague at this time if they need one year to collect evidence .
i mean where is the evidence upon which he 's been convicted in the first place ?
does n't make sense to convict someone and yell about it if you have n't got any evidence yet .
dragutin , yugoslavia now , when milosevic is on the way to hague , i can see many killers smiling , defending themselves and trying to find justification for what they did .
yes i am talking about general clark , tony blair , gerhard shroeder , jaimy shea and more .
since they need to clean themselves , i do n't think they will let milosevic have a fair trial , because fair trial would show the world real criminals - albanians and nato .
vladimir , serb in the usa it is not possible for him to have a fair trial , simply because the sentence that would be fair , for the things he did , does not exist .
if he would live for another 1,000 years he could not repay for the suffering he caused .
pedja , croatia i think it 's great that finally my brutal history is exported to holland .
i 'm so glad that i have a smart prime minister .
now someone should charge albanians for their crimes , serbs are not the only bad ones .
branislav petrovic , yugoslavia the only reason slobodan milosevic was handed over because serbian people accuse him for losing four wars in less than 10 years stevica , croatia the call to prayer from the neighbourhood mosque here in sarajevo sounded positively jubilant last night .
the feeling here among the local population and the local internationals is that this development was long overdue , but it is no less welcome for that .
since the serbian government ignored a ruling of the federation constitutional court , one might have some doubts as to whether the rule of law exists in the fry , but that is an internal matter for that country to sort out .
there is no doubt that as a matter of international law milosevic had to be handed over .
the next question is , when are radovan karadzic and ratko mladic going to the hague ?
they are rumoured to be living in the eastern republika srpska .
mladic is said actually to be enjoying the protection of the republika srpska army , which the republika srpska government denies .
their transfer to the hague would certainly be a major contribution to the bosnian peace process .
it is now time to order sfor to find them and arrest them .
there is no satisfactory answer to the question why this has not already been done .
peter , bosnia and herzegovina -lrb- expat -rrb- no , he will not get a fair trial , but you will certainly have something to write about and some politically engaged " lawyers " will boost their careers .
alon jabby , yugoslavia remember george orwell 's proverb : " all creatures are equal but some are more equal then others " what about the croatian , kosovo-albanian , bosniak and western war criminals ?
m van der harst , the hague , the netherlands milosevic will not get a fair trial - the ludicrous lockerbie judgement is proof of that .
why are new charges relating to bosnia and croatia being cooked up if the evidence relating to kosovo was so convincing ?
milosevic has been declared a war criminal by clinton , blair , cook etc. so it will take brave judges to defy them .
there are none at the hague .
gerard , london , uk just to inform you how much the us government recognizes the hague .
our government is in the process of passing a bill -lrb- introduced by senator helms -rrb- which would prevent extradition of us citizens to the hague .
i smell a double standard !
p.l. , detroit - usa while i reckon milosevic is a monster and no sentence will ever truly reflect the suffering he has inflicted i wonder how the west will react when the rest of this story is played out ?
by this i mean , given the history of the balkans it is only a matter of time before the albanian muslim community come looking for payback and commit atrocities of their own .
be it in macedonia or " cleansing " kosovo .
will the west bring their former protected peoples to the hague then ?
i suspect there will be plenty of double standards on offer .
matt l , ireland what justice your are talking about ?
real justice or , how the " little clark " , clinton , blair and others imagine it .
is milosevic guilty , more or less -lrb- and is he only one -rrb- is the matter of real justice .
i think that he has the big role in all bad things in last 12 years on the balkan , but what about the others - tudjman , izetbegovic etc .
i do n't even see any intention by the the hague tribunal to clear it .
the only obvious fact -lrb- there are 10 million witnesses -rrb- is against nato after bombing yugoslavia .
what more does miss carla del ponte need ?
who rules in the hague -lrb- justice or nato we will see -rrb- after milosevic 's trial and the steps of the court concerning the nato leaders -rrb- .
do n't speak to me about " the humanitarian bombing " , please it is the most cynical idea i ever heard .
v. nikolic , yugoslavia history will remember this as a serbian embarrassment adam soldan , kentucky this is just another example of politicians from whatever side causing human suffering and worldwide problems to feed their own ego and sense of importance .
we the public , have little choice to listen to their rhetoric and accept it as we will undoubtably never learn the real truth as it will be hidden deep in official secrecy .
the balkans is just one more example of politicians messing up and the armed services being given the task of going in to clean up their mess .
-lrb- an ex-serviceman -rrb- tom , uk it is a great shame that a country has had to resort to " sale " of its former leader .
if the new leaders in serbia had proceeded with the extradition right from the time they took over this would have been credible and commendable in the eyes of many .
but to do so only on the promise of money turns the whole thing into an outright sale .
first there was the offer of $ 50m , then he was arrested immediately in the middle of the night .
now there is an offer of $ 1.25bn on the table , and he is suddenly extradited , even before the proceedings of the constitutional court are finalised !
whilst i am not at all against milosevic standing trial for crimes against humanity , the manner in which the new leaders in serbia have handled the matter is a cause for concern .
look at the division it is causing already - the president is against the extradition - and who knows what may follow next ?
eugenia , geneva , switzerland the serb society that has kept him in power for so long , will also be on trial gorazd cvetic , valparaiso , chile mr. milosevic will receive a fair trial .
but , whether the court wants it or not , the serb society that has kept him in power for so long , will also be on trial .
whether the latter fact is fair or not - depends on whether the tears of some upset serbs are more tragic than the horrible deaths of tens of thousands of slavic moslems of bosnia and albanian moslems of kosova .
gorazd cvetic , valparaiso , chile i think it is funny .
that a nation can basically sell one of their own leaders .
i wish the worse for milosevic , he is a killer .
but the serbs are selling out to the west .
history will remember this as a serbian embarrassment .
adam soldan , kentucky fairness of the trial is not the issue but whether we the serbs will , during or after this trial , finally come to terms with our past and see the options .
whether we will get real .
sanja , belgrade , yugoslavia of even more importance , would be to see the western leaders tried , for their contribution to the balkans , namely a concerted effort to fracture and destroy the country zoran , uk it 's obvious that kostunica had to choose between the lesser of two evils- the extradition being the right choice .
however , nobody can argue that he will receive a fair trial .
the hague is after all , a political tool , and not a judicial one .
justice revolves around the notion of equity .
this would only apply to the hague if all persons responsible for the suffering of serbs , croats , and muslims alike were to be indicted .
perhaps of even more importance , would be to see the western leaders tried , for their contribution to the balkans .
namely a concerted effort to fracture and destroy the country , and masquerade it as assistance or humanitarian intervention .
the greatest crime of all , being the one sided nato hammering , of an already sanctioned and impoverished nation .
zoran , uk unfortunately the new govt in serbia failed to reform the judicial system fast enough to accommodate a fair trial in serbia -lrb- their own prime minister admitted this yesterday -rrb- - there is no alternative if serbia is going to put the past behind them and start building democratic institutions .
above all they and the rest of the world must give up the idea that there is any such thing as yugoslavia - this died with tito and the subsequent recognition by germany of slovenia .
the next big problem is how to make the albanians realise that they wo n't be allowed to break up macedonia .
huw sayer , london yugoslavia was forced to sell its former leader for 500 million euros vlad , uk let 's call a dog a dog : yugoslavia was forced to sell its former leader for 500 million euros .
yes , the leader was a crook and a tyrant .
and the sum may be increased .
but all that does n't matter .
what matters is that nato countries , after an illegal bombing campaign , openly financed yugoslavia 's opposition .
then , with unclear election results , they declared kostunica the winner and threatened yugoslavia that it would die of hunger if it did n't recognize kostinuca its president .
vlad , uk the balkans will remain a political hot potato for a long time .
since the assassination of the archduke of ferdinand in the region , that sparked the first world war , it seems the curse has taken root their .
there is no quick solution to the region .
over a period of time , the west should continue influencing constructive dialogues with the reform minded balkans and reward them with aid to keep their countries in good economic shape .
edirisa , canada milosevic will have his say in court to defend himself .
that is more than any of his opponents got and that includes serbs amongsts the bosnians , the croats and the kosovars .
stephen plowman , hants , uk the trial is already finished .
the very handover means the country is sold .
it responded to the " if you do n't give him up , you wo n't get aid / cheque " .
this statement in itself blantantly ignored the chance of reviving democracy in yugoslavia -lrb- in having milosevic trialed at home -rrb- .
this clearly incourages instability of kostunica 's government - who is the only decent man there and very alone .
how so - you may wonder ?
because milosevic has been ransomed against the law - and one thing kostunica is trying to establish is law and order - for a start .
and that has been taken away now .
tell me , who shall i thank for this so called victory of " democracy and justice ? "
it 's a victory of a muscle over an already broken country .
lj.evans , london , uk he was n't alone at least 50 % of the serb population needs to go there with him .
valmir osmani , prishtina , kosovo remember vietnam ?
any war criminals brought to " justice " ?
mick , nish , serbia how come pinochet was n't extradited and milosevic was ?
i 'll tell you why - pinochet was more friendly to the western world and an ' ally ' and milosevic was n't .
bring the bad guys from all sides to trial and it 'll be different .
until this happens , he wo n't get a fair trial .
stephen , uk war crimes trials rarely offer true justice david , uk war crimes trials rarely offer true justice .
it is now universally recognised that nuremberg was the biggest act of hypocrisy in history , and this trial will hardly do much to allay my scepticism -lrb- especially as the us aid program will be foremost in some minds -rrb- .
david , uk my friend is serbian and she 's not happy - she wanted him to be tried for war crimes in serbia under serbian law .
personally , i fail to see how he could possibly have a fair trial , but how can he conjure up a defence ?
the evidence appears to be damning in the extreme .
alex banks , uk , living in holland this is the first time a head of state is tried by an international court .
that fact alone suggest that objectivity is impossible , as there is no previous case law .
rather , the judgement will be passed based on judges ' opinions , which must be heavily influenced already , after ten years of milosevic being on the front pages .
bojan , london , uk the hand over of milosevic will upset many serbs who still think of him as their hero ron dyce , moldova the hand over of milosevic will upset many serbs who still think of him as their hero .
he defended them against the rest of the world .
many serbs closed their eyes to the horrors which they knew were taking place because they were alone and had to stick together .
there is a strong case to be made for the serb side in the wars in former yugoslavia but it was rarely heard .
the bosnian and croat propaganda machine won because milosevic was an old style dictator , who was incompetent at news management .
ron dyce , moldova firstly , milosevic was not a dictator but a democratically elected president .
secondly , so okay he 's being tried but what about those that carried out crimes against the serbs .
i 'm no fan of this guy but it takes two to tango .
the west only see milosevic and the serbs as the bad guys ... the serbs are also victims !
p verma , delhi , india it is going to be very difficult for milosevic to get a fair trial when karazdic and mladic have not been brought to justice , and tudjman is dead .
i suspect milosevic will end up a scapegoat for all that went wrong in the former yugoslavia .
iain , uk the sentence that would be fair , for the things he did , does not exist pedja , croatia it is not possible for him to have a fair trial , simply because the sentence that would be fair , for the things he did , does not exist .
if he lives for another thousand years , he could not pay for the suffering he caused .
pedja , croatia the fairness of the trial depends on the make-up of the un court .
if the us muscles its way into being judge , jury , and executioner , milosevic is as good as guilty .
if he is rightfully tried by a jury of non-us and non-kosovo peacekeeping related allies , true justice , the only justice that is supposed to come from the un , will be served .
nick steffel , united states not only should justice be done , it should also seen to be done .
the hague court is widely perceived to be a kangaroo court - a creation of nato and the west , established to provide a fig leaf to cloak the furtherance of western political and economic interests .
mohansingh , india a fair trial ?
that depends on who decides what is fair .
serbs will feel hard done by if milosevic is tried , as others who committed crimes against them have not been tried .
until all war criminals are brought before the international tribunal , questions will remain concerning its political motives and impartiality .
ibrahim of course milosevic wo n't receive a fair trial .
nato and its cohorts need to put together their neat and packaged history of all the balkan wars and blame it on milosevic and his aides so that they can brush aside the complications of the wars which their actions probably led up to creating .

vladimir , usa the final verdict - whatever that will be - will reflect the very best application of international law by an international court david , usa the international tribunal at the hague has nothing to do with the united states .
it is an impartial international court run according to strict guidelines of legal procedure .
the comments from some people in this forum that the court is somehow a tool of american policy are to put it bluntly , absurd .
milosevic will receive a fair and impartial trial by this tribunal after a thorough and meticulous examination of evidence .
the final verdict - whatever that will be - will reflect the very best application of international law by an international court .
david , usa given the fact that major western powers have already declared milosevic a criminal and made him responsible for all crimes and ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia , a fair trial is highly unlikely .
the only purpose of his trial would be to justify the western policy , namely the military intervention against yugoslavia .
alam , us there is no doubt that milosevic is guilty of multiple war crimes and he should be punished and harshly .
this question is moot .

robert del valle , usa is it possible to even expect a fair trial when it is linked with economic benefits from a country that declines the idea of joining the international criminal court .
it is not pardonable what milosevic did , but to be brought to " justice " by a nation and its allies who are not very far from being the same seems ironic .
samit chakrabarty , canada of course not !
the hague court is a political instrument formed by us and other countries from nato .
it had to justify the crimes nato committed bombing yugoslavia .
as we all know , the winners write the history .
m peric , canada he wo n't receive a fair trial , but then everybody knows he is guilty so he 'll get what he deserves .
the broader question is : how credible is the war crimes tribunal when it continues to prosecute only one side ?
until we see some nato generals or western politicians answering for their actions , it will always been viewed by the rest of the world as a western " kangaroo court " that deflects attention away from human rights violations carried out by more powerful western nations .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- milosevic trial : what now for the balkans ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo saturday , 30 june , 2001 , 08:56 gmt 09:56 uk milosevic trial : what now for the balkans ?
the former yugoslav president , slobodan milosevic , is in custody in the hague where he will become the first former head of state to appear before the international war crimes tribunal .
he will face charges of planning and ordering a campaign of terror , persecution and violence against the kosovo albanians at the end of the 1990s .
his extradition has strained yugoslavia 's governing coalition with yugoslav president vojislav kostunica denouncing the extradition as illegal and unconstitutional .
after handing over mr milosevic , yugoslavia has been promised more than $ 1.2bn in desperately needed financial aid from international donors that is crucial for the country 's economic recovery .
what do you think about the extradition of slobodan milosevic ?
what are the implications for the future of yugoslavia and the balkan region ?
if you are from the former yugoslavia what does this moment mean for you ?
we will be discussing the extradition of slobodan milosevic and the implications for the balkan region on sunday in a talking point phone-in programme broadcast on bbc world service radio and on bbc news online at 1500 bst -lrb- 1400 gmt -rrb- .
if you would like to take part , please include a telephone number with your comments where we may contact you .
i am ashamed to be a serb , my country has sold out one of its sons .
who cares whether he 's a criminal , we lost our pride and sovereignty .
never has another country sold their leader for 1 billion non-delivered dollars .
draza pizdolizac , ravna gora , yugoslavia thanks to mr milosevic -lrb- but not only him , i agree -rrb- 10 million people spent 12 years suffering , loosing their dearest ones , and their homes .
what is one arrest compared to that ?
with what sentence can dead become alive again ?
but at least , last night mr milosevic and his family spent one sleepless night .
at least that .
zdenka , sarajevo keeping milosevic in serbia would just have made him an eternal obstacle in our lives .
ivan , belgrade , yugoslavia as most young people in serbia , i am glad milosevic finally got extradited .
it was high time we finished with him once and for all .
even after october 5th , he still remained as a shadow clouding our perspectives for the future .
we have endured more than a decade of his ruling .
keeping milosevic in serbia would just have made him an eternal obstacle in our lives .
even though i do n't have a high opinion of the hague tribunal i 'm grateful for having a decisive enough government that decided not to let one man endanger the future of a whole nation ... at least , not any more .
ivan , belgrade , yugoslavia serbia has done the right thing , by sending milosevic to the hague .
i ask you when will croatia , bosnian federation , nato do the same ?
i do n't think croatia will ever send their generals or politicians to the kangaroo court .how many serbs where killed in krajina and how many where forced out of their homes ?
no kangaroo court for the croats milos mihalovic , pristina serbia i 'm thankful milosevic is headed to the hague for the sake of croatia .
not just for vengeance 's sake -lrb- though admittedly that has a part -rrb- , but because it will be easier for the croatian government to extradite its alleged war criminals in the eyes of the croatian public .
when croatia 's general blaskic received his 40 + year sentence it was the first real destabilizer to the new-at-that-time croatian government .
the fact that the primary aggressors were n't being pursued made it difficult for croatia to comply .
now with some serbs on the dock , croatia can flush a few more of its war scum out .
now let 's see them bring in mladic and karazdic and then we 'll have a fairer set of trials in a regional sense .
dk , elkins , nh , usa slobodan is as guilty as a whole host of other figures from east and west who ought to be in the dock with him ivan , zagreb , croatia slobodan is as guilty as a whole host of other figures from east and west who ought to be in the dock with him .
the entire war has been a mired in the filthiest of political smoke and mirrors , arm-twisting and deals -lrb- otherwise known as " diplomacy " -rrb- .
i 'm not convinced that the western powers give a damn what he did , but his removal from power ensures that the west can get on with the business of making sure that serbia is under the west 's thumb .
ivan , zagreb , croatia if anybody should put milosevic on trial it should be the serbs .
and if somebody should extradite someone that would have to be usa , germany , uk , france .
he is responsible for losing territories and serbian lives .
this is the greatest shame in the history of the serbs .
i only know that i could not live with myself if i had to extradite someone like djindjic did .
vladimir , belgrade , serbia the only reason slobodan milosevic was handed over because serbian people accuse him for losing four wars in less than 10 years , not because they think he was responsible for atrocities committed against humanity .
once they hand karadjic and mladic we may say that the serbian people have purged themselves like the germans did after the second world war .
stevica , croatia the call to prayer from the neighbourhood mosque here in sarajevo sounded positively jubilant last night peter , bosnia hercegovina i do n't know if he 's going to get a fair trial ... probably not but i do n't understand why did the prosecutor wanted him so bad in the hague at this time if they need one year to collect evidence .
i mean where is the evidence upon which he 's been convicted in the first place ?
does n't make sense to convict someone and yell about it if you have n't got any evidence yet .
dragutin , yugoslavia now , when milosevic is on the way to hague , i can see many killers smiling , defending themselves and trying to find justification for what they did .
yes i am talking about general clark , tony blair , gerhard shroeder , jaimy shea and more .
since they need to clean themselves , i do n't think they will let milosevic have a fair trial , because fair trial would show the world real criminals - albanians and nato .
vladimir , serb in the usa it is not possible for him to have a fair trial , simply because the sentence that would be fair , for the things he did , does not exist .
if he would live for another 1,000 years he could not repay for the suffering he caused .
pedja , croatia i think it 's great that finally my brutal history is exported to holland .
i 'm so glad that i have a smart prime minister .
now someone should charge albanians for their crimes , serbs are not the only bad ones .
branislav petrovic , yugoslavia the only reason slobodan milosevic was handed over because serbian people accuse him for losing four wars in less than 10 years stevica , croatia the call to prayer from the neighbourhood mosque here in sarajevo sounded positively jubilant last night .
the feeling here among the local population and the local internationals is that this development was long overdue , but it is no less welcome for that .
since the serbian government ignored a ruling of the federation constitutional court , one might have some doubts as to whether the rule of law exists in the fry , but that is an internal matter for that country to sort out .
there is no doubt that as a matter of international law milosevic had to be handed over .
the next question is , when are radovan karadzic and ratko mladic going to the hague ?
they are rumoured to be living in the eastern republika srpska .
mladic is said actually to be enjoying the protection of the republika srpska army , which the republika srpska government denies .
their transfer to the hague would certainly be a major contribution to the bosnian peace process .
it is now time to order sfor to find them and arrest them .
there is no satisfactory answer to the question why this has not already been done .
peter , bosnia and herzegovina -lrb- expat -rrb- no , he will not get a fair trial , but you will certainly have something to write about and some politically engaged " lawyers " will boost their careers .
alon jabby , yugoslavia remember george orwell 's proverb : " all creatures are equal but some are more equal then others " what about the croatian , kosovo-albanian , bosniak and western war criminals ?
m van der harst , the hague , the netherlands milosevic will not get a fair trial - the ludicrous lockerbie judgement is proof of that .
why are new charges relating to bosnia and croatia being cooked up if the evidence relating to kosovo was so convincing ?
milosevic has been declared a war criminal by clinton , blair , cook etc. so it will take brave judges to defy them .
there are none at the hague .
gerard , london , uk just to inform you how much the us government recognizes the hague .
our government is in the process of passing a bill -lrb- introduced by senator helms -rrb- which would prevent extradition of us citizens to the hague .
i smell a double standard !
p.l. , detroit - usa while i reckon milosevic is a monster and no sentence will ever truly reflect the suffering he has inflicted i wonder how the west will react when the rest of this story is played out ?
by this i mean , given the history of the balkans it is only a matter of time before the albanian muslim community come looking for payback and commit atrocities of their own .
be it in macedonia or " cleansing " kosovo .
will the west bring their former protected peoples to the hague then ?
i suspect there will be plenty of double standards on offer .
matt l , ireland what justice your are talking about ?
real justice or , how the " little clark " , clinton , blair and others imagine it .
is milosevic guilty , more or less -lrb- and is he only one -rrb- is the matter of real justice .
i think that he has the big role in all bad things in last 12 years on the balkan , but what about the others - tudjman , izetbegovic etc .
i do n't even see any intention by the the hague tribunal to clear it .
the only obvious fact -lrb- there are 10 million witnesses -rrb- is against nato after bombing yugoslavia .
what more does miss carla del ponte need ?
who rules in the hague -lrb- justice or nato we will see -rrb- after milosevic 's trial and the steps of the court concerning the nato leaders -rrb- .
do n't speak to me about " the humanitarian bombing " , please it is the most cynical idea i ever heard .
v. nikolic , yugoslavia history will remember this as a serbian embarrassment adam soldan , kentucky this is just another example of politicians from whatever side causing human suffering and worldwide problems to feed their own ego and sense of importance .
we the public , have little choice to listen to their rhetoric and accept it as we will undoubtably never learn the real truth as it will be hidden deep in official secrecy .
the balkans is just one more example of politicians messing up and the armed services being given the task of going in to clean up their mess .
-lrb- an ex-serviceman -rrb- tom , uk it is a great shame that a country has had to resort to " sale " of its former leader .
if the new leaders in serbia had proceeded with the extradition right from the time they took over this would have been credible and commendable in the eyes of many .
but to do so only on the promise of money turns the whole thing into an outright sale .
first there was the offer of $ 50m , then he was arrested immediately in the middle of the night .
now there is an offer of $ 1.25bn on the table , and he is suddenly extradited , even before the proceedings of the constitutional court are finalised !
whilst i am not at all against milosevic standing trial for crimes against humanity , the manner in which the new leaders in serbia have handled the matter is a cause for concern .
look at the division it is causing already - the president is against the extradition - and who knows what may follow next ?
eugenia , geneva , switzerland the serb society that has kept him in power for so long , will also be on trial gorazd cvetic , valparaiso , chile mr. milosevic will receive a fair trial .
but , whether the court wants it or not , the serb society that has kept him in power for so long , will also be on trial .
whether the latter fact is fair or not - depends on whether the tears of some upset serbs are more tragic than the horrible deaths of tens of thousands of slavic moslems of bosnia and albanian moslems of kosova .
gorazd cvetic , valparaiso , chile i think it is funny .
that a nation can basically sell one of their own leaders .
i wish the worse for milosevic , he is a killer .
but the serbs are selling out to the west .
history will remember this as a serbian embarrassment .
adam soldan , kentucky fairness of the trial is not the issue but whether we the serbs will , during or after this trial , finally come to terms with our past and see the options .
whether we will get real .
sanja , belgrade , yugoslavia of even more importance , would be to see the western leaders tried , for their contribution to the balkans , namely a concerted effort to fracture and destroy the country zoran , uk it 's obvious that kostunica had to choose between the lesser of two evils- the extradition being the right choice .
however , nobody can argue that he will receive a fair trial .
the hague is after all , a political tool , and not a judicial one .
justice revolves around the notion of equity .
this would only apply to the hague if all persons responsible for the suffering of serbs , croats , and muslims alike were to be indicted .
perhaps of even more importance , would be to see the western leaders tried , for their contribution to the balkans .
namely a concerted effort to fracture and destroy the country , and masquerade it as assistance or humanitarian intervention .
the greatest crime of all , being the one sided nato hammering , of an already sanctioned and impoverished nation .
zoran , uk unfortunately the new govt in serbia failed to reform the judicial system fast enough to accommodate a fair trial in serbia -lrb- their own prime minister admitted this yesterday -rrb- - there is no alternative if serbia is going to put the past behind them and start building democratic institutions .
above all they and the rest of the world must give up the idea that there is any such thing as yugoslavia - this died with tito and the subsequent recognition by germany of slovenia .
the next big problem is how to make the albanians realise that they wo n't be allowed to break up macedonia .
huw sayer , london yugoslavia was forced to sell its former leader for 500 million euros vlad , uk let 's call a dog a dog : yugoslavia was forced to sell its former leader for 500 million euros .
yes , the leader was a crook and a tyrant .
and the sum may be increased .
but all that does n't matter .
what matters is that nato countries , after an illegal bombing campaign , openly financed yugoslavia 's opposition .
then , with unclear election results , they declared kostunica the winner and threatened yugoslavia that it would die of hunger if it did n't recognize kostinuca its president .
vlad , uk the balkans will remain a political hot potato for a long time .
since the assassination of the archduke of ferdinand in the region , that sparked the first world war , it seems the curse has taken root their .
there is no quick solution to the region .
over a period of time , the west should continue influencing constructive dialogues with the reform minded balkans and reward them with aid to keep their countries in good economic shape .
edirisa , canada milosevic will have his say in court to defend himself .
that is more than any of his opponents got and that includes serbs amongsts the bosnians , the croats and the kosovars .
stephen plowman , hants , uk the trial is already finished .
the very handover means the country is sold .
it responded to the " if you do n't give him up , you wo n't get aid / cheque " .
this statement in itself blantantly ignored the chance of reviving democracy in yugoslavia -lrb- in having milosevic trialed at home -rrb- .
this clearly incourages instability of kostunica 's government - who is the only decent man there and very alone .
how so - you may wonder ?
because milosevic has been ransomed against the law - and one thing kostunica is trying to establish is law and order - for a start .
and that has been taken away now .
tell me , who shall i thank for this so called victory of " democracy and justice ? "
it 's a victory of a muscle over an already broken country .
lj.evans , london , uk he was n't alone at least 50 % of the serb population needs to go there with him .
valmir osmani , prishtina , kosovo remember vietnam ?
any war criminals brought to " justice " ?
mick , nish , serbia how come pinochet was n't extradited and milosevic was ?
i 'll tell you why - pinochet was more friendly to the western world and an ' ally ' and milosevic was n't .
bring the bad guys from all sides to trial and it 'll be different .
until this happens , he wo n't get a fair trial .
stephen , uk war crimes trials rarely offer true justice david , uk war crimes trials rarely offer true justice .
it is now universally recognised that nuremberg was the biggest act of hypocrisy in history , and this trial will hardly do much to allay my scepticism -lrb- especially as the us aid program will be foremost in some minds -rrb- .
david , uk my friend is serbian and she 's not happy - she wanted him to be tried for war crimes in serbia under serbian law .
personally , i fail to see how he could possibly have a fair trial , but how can he conjure up a defence ?
the evidence appears to be damning in the extreme .
alex banks , uk , living in holland this is the first time a head of state is tried by an international court .
that fact alone suggest that objectivity is impossible , as there is no previous case law .
rather , the judgement will be passed based on judges ' opinions , which must be heavily influenced already , after ten years of milosevic being on the front pages .
bojan , london , uk the hand over of milosevic will upset many serbs who still think of him as their hero ron dyce , moldova the hand over of milosevic will upset many serbs who still think of him as their hero .
he defended them against the rest of the world .
many serbs closed their eyes to the horrors which they knew were taking place because they were alone and had to stick together .
there is a strong case to be made for the serb side in the wars in former yugoslavia but it was rarely heard .
the bosnian and croat propaganda machine won because milosevic was an old style dictator , who was incompetent at news management .
ron dyce , moldova firstly , milosevic was not a dictator but a democratically elected president .
secondly , so okay he 's being tried but what about those that carried out crimes against the serbs .
i 'm no fan of this guy but it takes two to tango .
the west only see milosevic and the serbs as the bad guys ... the serbs are also victims !
p verma , delhi , india it is going to be very difficult for milosevic to get a fair trial when karazdic and mladic have not been brought to justice , and tudjman is dead .
i suspect milosevic will end up a scapegoat for all that went wrong in the former yugoslavia .
iain , uk the sentence that would be fair , for the things he did , does not exist pedja , croatia it is not possible for him to have a fair trial , simply because the sentence that would be fair , for the things he did , does not exist .
if he lives for another thousand years , he could not pay for the suffering he caused .
pedja , croatia the fairness of the trial depends on the make-up of the un court .
if the us muscles its way into being judge , jury , and executioner , milosevic is as good as guilty .
if he is rightfully tried by a jury of non-us and non-kosovo peacekeeping related allies , true justice , the only justice that is supposed to come from the un , will be served .
nick steffel , united states not only should justice be done , it should also seen to be done .
the hague court is widely perceived to be a kangaroo court - a creation of nato and the west , established to provide a fig leaf to cloak the furtherance of western political and economic interests .
mohansingh , india a fair trial ?
that depends on who decides what is fair .
serbs will feel hard done by if milosevic is tried , as others who committed crimes against them have not been tried .
until all war criminals are brought before the international tribunal , questions will remain concerning its political motives and impartiality .
ibrahim of course milosevic wo n't receive a fair trial .
nato and its cohorts need to put together their neat and packaged history of all the balkan wars and blame it on milosevic and his aides so that they can brush aside the complications of the wars which their actions probably led up to creating .
dave matthews , uk there is no way that milosevic will get a fair trial , the court in the hague is explicitly biased against serbs .
what kind of court has " secret " witnesses and sealed indictments ?

a note posted to several newsgroups says that " music fans around the planet will receive a shocking surprise on their computers on american independence day , 4 july , but only if they have downloaded unauthorised songs from napster , gnutella or other file swapping applications on the internet . "
obviously a hoax and not a very good one rob rosenberger , vmyths.com according to the message , a " new hybrid computer code " named musicpanel has been surreptitiously buried inside mp3 files of 500 popular tunes and distributed over the past eight months among unsuspecting " song thieves " using the popular napster and gnutella file-exchange services .
the hoax goes on to say " those who have downloaded any of the 500 most popular songs ... will find their illicit music unusable and their computers frozen due to the time release of this bomb " .
piracy manifesto but experts point out that data files such as mp3s can not execute by themselves and thus can not have computer viruses embedded in them .
rob rosenberger , who runs the virus myths and hoaxes website vmyths.com , said musicpanel was " obviously a hoax and not a very good one .
but some people are falling for it " .
