in burnley , lancashire , a weekend of violence in june climaxed with more than 200 youths attacking shops , homes and vehicles .
police in riot gear managed to head off direct confrontation between gangs of asian and white youths but admitted they were taken by surprise at the scale of the violence .
the riots were an escalation of minor disturbances the previous night which were apparently sparked by white youths attacking an asian taxi driver .
asian community leaders later blamed police who , they said , had taken 30 minutes to respond to the alleged attack .
after the violence , police said they would work with members of the community and community leaders to prevent similar events happening again .
in may , violence erupted in the nearby town of oldham .
hundreds of asian youths clashed with police during a night of rioting , which the police described as " sheer carnage " .
' no-go zones ' fifteen officers were injured and 17 people arrested after weeks of racial tension between white and asian youths spilt over into violence .
the riots were believed to have begun after a gang of white youths attacked asian homes in the glodwick area of the town .
youth worker ashid ali , chairman of the oldham bangladeshi youth association , said far-right organisations had been trying to provoke violence for weeks .
" unfortunately the whole of the uk will look at this as being a riot between the police and asian youths , when it was clearly sparked by white youths , " he said .
the greater manchester town has significant pakistani and bangladeshi populations , living in similar but separate run down inner-city enclaves .
last year more than 600 racist incidents were logged by oldham police and in 60 % of them the victims were white .
but police denied that asian youths were turning parts of the town into " no-go zones " for whites .
