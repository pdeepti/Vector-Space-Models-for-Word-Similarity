silvano langa , director of the national disaster management institute , told the bbc that the cahora bassa dam - the country 's largest - was virtually full as it has been receiving increased discharges of water from neighbouring zimbabwe and zambia .
if they open the dam as they may be forced to we could see a major loss of life alan hooker , aid worker mr langa said the authorities had been forced to allow an increased amount of water through to the floodplain of central mozambique , inundating more areas .
officials estimate that 15,000 people are in immediate danger and should be evacuated .
and more than 70,000 people , including the 41,000 residents of the town of marromeu , would have to be evacuated if the dam is opened .
a total of 41 people have been confirmed dead , but aid agencies warn that the number could rise .
" if it continues raining as forecast and if they open the dam as they may be forced to , we could see a major loss of life " , said alan hooker , of the aid group world vision .
about 77,000 have been left homeless as a result of the floods , the second worst to hit the country in a year .
up to 50,000 have been made homeless in the neighbouring states of zambia and malawi .
south african assistance south african rescue workers are making their way to the area to estimate how many aircraft will be needed for a mass evacuation .
south african president thabo mbeki is reportedly poised to commit the south african defence force to respond to mozambique 's request for international help .
during devastating floods in mozambique a year ago that killed 700 people , south african pilots played a critical role in rescue operations and in providing humanitarian aid to flood victims .
mr langa said an operation to evacuate those in danger , mainly in the central districts of caia and mutarara , was under way but had been hit by a shortage of air transport .
mr langa said just three large helicopters were involved in the operation to airlift the stranded people to temporary shelters on higher ground , as well to distribute relief aid .
while some 200 boats are also involved in the evacuation exercise , the surging currents are making them less efficient .
rains have washed away roads and bridges in the provinces of zambezia and sofala , hampering efforts to distribute aid by road .
