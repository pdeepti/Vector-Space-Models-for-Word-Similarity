members of the call centre association have gathered in glasgow for their seventh annual convention , with the main aim of highlighting best practice .
the convention was due to tackle the impact of new technology on their business , as well as the poor image the industry has as an employer .

a recent report from the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- highlighted draconian working conditions in some call centres - including an anecdote of a man having his pay docked because he had to be taken to hospital .
it came at a time when the business was facing a major challenge from the process of globalisation with call centres in countries like india able to undercut costs in the uk .
but the industry said it was well placed to deal with the challenge , using the skills being honed north of the border .
the number of call centre jobs has jumped by nearly 220 % in nearly four years with an increasing number employed in scotland .

the surprise move comes after the first minister in waiting , jack mcconnell , promised the liberal democrats he would deliver a timetable on electoral reform by christmas .
the way is clear for mr mcconnell to become first minister , after he secured the support of lib dems msps with a pledge on voting reform for local councils .
scottish national party leader john swinney , independent msp dennis canavan and tory leader david mcletchie will challenge mr mcconnell for the post of first minister .
scotland 's labour leader promised a timetable for electoral reform by christmas , but the snp is set to increase pressure on the coalition .
the nationalists will outline how they intend to take forward the campaign to see legislation on proportional representation elections for councils .
snp local government spokesman tricia marwick is expected to unveil plans for a member 's bill to introduce pr .
the party said the time for talking has passed and it is now time for action .
this new development could cause a dilemma for lib dem backbenchers , who are concerned that progress has been slow .
before tuesday 's meeting mr swinney attempted to increase the pressure on lib dem leader jim wallace by saying that he needed to " show some backbone and insist on a firm commitment to pr for local government " .
mr wallace said that although the lib dems recognised that those within the labour party had different opinions on reform , progress had to be made .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- vietnam freezes rice exports categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 21 november , 2001 , 07:01 gmt vietnam freezes rice exports the price of rice has risen sharply in recent months the world 's number two rice exporter , vietnam , has blocked shipments until february because of a shortage of reserves for its own population .
" we need to maintain a stable domestic market for food supply until we have a new harvesting season , " an official in the trade ministry 's rice management office said .
the ministry ordered traders in its main rice-growing region to stop offering new rice export contracts , after seeing domestic reserves falling .
expensive staple food rice prices have risen about 20 % in recent months to 2.9m vietnamese dong -lrb- £ 136 ; $ 193 -rrb- per tonne from 2.4m dong in may and june .
the winter-spring crop will yield between february and april traders in vietnam have been running out of stock ahead of the winter-spring crop planting season , which starts next month and produces yields between february and april .
during the first 10 months of this year , they exported almost 10 % more rice than last year .
running out of rice vietnam 's rice shortage is partly due to a reduction in vietnam 's rice planting area after serious floods last year interrupted the autumn crop .
total rice production for the year is predicted to fall to 31.9 million tonnes from last year 's 32.5 million tonnes .
at the same time , total exports for the year are expected to rise 6.4 % to 3.7 million tonnes .
the freeze on new contracts to export rice will retain more of the staple crop as food for the vietnamese people .
this should help curb price rises at home .
cheap rice internationally paradoxically , while rice prices have risen in vietnam , they have fallen internationally .
despite the near 10 % rise in exports during the first 10 months of the year , the value of the exports fell 6.1 % .
the low international prices has eased delivery fears among vietnam 's rice traders , who have signed contracts to export more rice than they have in stock .
the export freeze had no impact on the market , said one rice trader .
no deals have been struck , anyway , since the beginning of november because of the high prices , he added .
" offers of vietnamese rice have been $ 20 higher than thai rice , so nobody wanted to buy from vietnam , " he said .
traders who have to deliver rice to other countries to honour contracts they signed earlier this year have begun buying rice in third countries rather than shipping vietnamese rice .
vietnam 's state-run southern food recently bought 10,000 tonnes of rice in thailand and shipped it straight to its customers in russia , the trader said .

a university of ulster survey published on wednesday said the executive at stormont must tackle " discrimination " in transport provision .
academic dr liz fawcett , a lecturer in the school of communication , has outlined some of the results of the survey examining public attitudes on a range of issues , including transport .
it was carried out by the northern ireland life and times survey team .
the survey , a joint venture between the university of ulster and queen 's university in belfast - found more than two-fifths of rural respondents had no nearby bus services to take them to shops and other facilities .
residents the authors said that was in " stark contrast " to the rest of the uk where just 12 % of rural residents were in a similar position .
access to public transport appears to be poor throughout northern ireland dr liz fawcett the report revealed 25 % of rural respondents did not drive a car .
dr fawcett said : " there does seem to be a tendency among rural politicians to assume that everyone in their constituencies wants more by-passes built .
" these findings suggest that a considerable proportion of people in rural areas do n't drive and a significant percentage do n't have any bus service close to hand . "
age groups she said a number of other socially excluded groups were not properly served by public transport .
" the survey data shows clearly that you 're less likely to have access to a car or to drive if you 're in a lower social class category , if you 're a woman , or if you 're in either the oldest or youngest age groups , " said dr fawcett .
" that means that all these groups rely more heavily on public transport . "
the academic said it was clear that those who suffered social exclusion in many other ways also suffered discrimination through the inadequate provision of public transport in northern ireland .
" the northern ireland executive is committed to tacking all forms of social exclusion - one hopes that it will put improving public transport near the top of its agenda . "

the us did not appear to share in the growing international consensus that action to alleviate poverty worldwide was needed to prevent a repeat of the 11 september atrocities , said ms short .
her comments have been welcomed by charities who say time is running out to get aid into afghanistan .

" it is not that the us is ungenerous .
it is just that it is not sharing the insight that other countries have got and it is very important that we try to get them there . "
shadow international development secretary caroline spelman said the us has not turned its back on the people of afghanistan .
" america was the largest donor of aid to afghanistan before 11 september .
" without american help the taleban would still be oppressing the people of afghanistan . "
but john davidson , spokesman for the charity christian aid , told bbc radio 4 's today programme that ms short 's assessment of the situation was timely .
" the window of opportunity to provide food to the most vulnerable areas shrinks all the time , " he said .
he argued a un presence was needed in the region to ensure humanitarian aid could be delivered , amid concern that the situation within afghanistan had deteriorated since the northern alliance made gains 10 days ago .
rift played down earlier , downing street played down reports of a rift with the us over troop deployments .
washington is said to be wary of committing peacekeeping forces , preferring to concentrate on capturing osama bin laden and destroying his al-qaeda network .
prime minister tony blair is thought to be in favour of deploying troops on the ground .
mr blair 's official spokesman said the prime minister spoke by phone to president george w bush on monday as part of a continuing dialogue on afghanistan and covered humanitarian , diplomatic and military efforts .
both leaders agreed " great progress " had been made in the past 10 days but acknowledged " there was still a lot more that had to be done " .

the group , ndpc -lrb- national dropout prevention centre -rrb- international , says that a rejection of school by youngsters has become " endemic " in many education systems across the developed world .
and that such an international problem could most effectively be tackled by considering experiences from other countries .
" there is a significant minority of school pupils who find school untenable for a number of reasons , " says reva klein , the london-based author who is chair of the campaign .
" in some united states cities it can be as high as 50 % of the school population .
given the current emphasis on school inclusion , we all have much to gain from sharing the experiences , analysis and strategies from around the world .
" this will help make our schools not only more relevant and accessible but also more compelling places for young people . "
in the united states , in october 2000 there were 3.8m young people over the age of 16 who had not completed high school , representing 10.9 % of the 16 to 24 year old population .
surveys of school disaffection in the united states have found that among the reasons cited for dropping out are not liking school , not getting on with teachers or other students , academic failure and pregnancy .
and in the united kingdom , truancy and drop-out rates have remained stubbornly high , particularly in deprived areas .
international experts but in the netherlands , the czech republic and scandinavian countries , she says there is almost no drop-out problem .
in japan , more than 1 % of students dropped out last year which , although comparitively small , represents a 20 % increase from two years ago .
the campaign will bring together academics and educationalists with expertise in the united kingdom , the united states , the caribbean , australia and south america .
this collaborative approach to disaffection has been inspired by the national dropout prevention centre in south carolina in the united states .

researchers in the us have discovered that the brain 's ability to control the body 's sleep cycle is reduced when it is not exposed to the earth 's ' natural time cues ' .
their results could mean that longer missions into space , such as to mars , could be jeopardised by performance problems caused by lack of sleep .
jerry linenger spent five months in space the team , led by timothy h. monk , professor of psychiatry at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine , based their findings on the sleep patterns of american astronaut , jerry m. linenger , during a five month journey into space .
24-hour rhythm dr linenger lived aboard russian space station mir between january and may 1997 .
during that time he kept records of his sleep patterns .
his records revealed that he regularly went to bed at about 11.30pm and awoke at approximately 6am .
but towards the end of the five month period dr linenger had to force himself to keep to the routine and the amount and quality of his sleep reduced .
he woke more during the night and his temperature and alertness during the day also reduced .
dr monk and his team concluded that the endogenous circadian pacemaker -lrb- ecp -rrb- , the part of the brain controlling the body 's cycle of sleep , wakefulness , alertness , temperature and brain chemistry , was able to maintain its 24-hour rhythm for about 90 days after leaving earth .
quality and quantity after that , the ability of the ecp , or the bodyclock , significantly diminished resulting in a drop in the quality and quantity of sleep .
dr monk said : " man 's ability to leave earth and travel in space raises the question of whether the ecp , which evolved on a planet with a 24-hour rotation , would still function well when removed from all the natural time cues of the earth .
" our study show that human kind may need to find ways to trick the ecp into maintaining a strong 24-hour cycle if we are to succeed on longer missions . "
commenting on the findings , professor neil douglas , chairman of the british sleep foundation , said : " the results are confirmation of what one would expect .
these results have implications for sleep and performance in night shift and rotating shift workers who similarly do not get cues from light dark cycles professor neil douglas " they have implications for sleep and performance in night shift and rotating shift workers who similarly do not get cues from light dark cycles which are in phase with their sleep wake cycle .
" it is increasingly obvious that they sleep , perform and drive worse than permanent day shift workers . "
vicky brightman , space now co-ordinator at the national space centre , said : " sleep problems for astronauts are one of several major problems which need to be overcome before longer missions into space could be successful .
" scientists are constantly trying to find ways to overcome these problems and currently more than half the medication taken by astronauts when they are in space is to try and help them to sleep . "

hundreds of websites have sprung up selling everything from mail sterilisers to oregano oil to prevent and treat illnesses such as anthrax .
but now the us government is cracking down on dozens of websites that it claims are selling unproven products to counter bio-terrorism threats .
the federal trade commission has sent some 40 e-mails to the operators of such websites , telling them to stop marketing such products or face prosecution .
' disturbing sites ' the ftc , the food and drug administration , the california department of health services and the offices of more than 30 state attorneys-general scoured the web for sites selling products that claimed to protect or counter biological and chemical agents .
the internet search uncovered more than 200 sites marketing bio-terrorism related products including gas masks , protective suits , mail sterilizers , biohazard test kits , homeopathic remedies and dietary supplements .
essentially , these operators need to shut down these areas of their sites or face prosecution howard beales , the federal trade commission the sites are claiming that dietary supplements such as colloidal silver , zinc mineral water , thyme and oregano oil are effective treatments for illnesses such as anthrax .
but the ftc said it was aware of no scientific proof for such claims .
and john taylor with the food and drug administration 's office of enforcement said that no products being marketed as dietary supplements had proven safe and effective in the treatment of anthrax .
" together with the ftc , we 've found quite a number of disturbing sites , " mr taylor said .
" companies marketing unapproved or otherwise misbranded products for anthrax or other diseases run a very high risk of fda enforcement or regulatory action . "
the ftc said that opportunistic online marketers are preying on the fears of the public .
" this marketing targets people worried about the prospect of exposure to lethal biological or chemical weapons , " said howard beales , the ftc 's director of consumer protection .
and the us government is working with state and local authorities to close down sites that are using worries over bio-terrorism to make money selling ineffective products .
washington attorney-general christine gregoire said state attorneys-general " will not stand by while website operators capitalise on public fears by selling products that offer no protection . "
buyer beware not all homeopathic or alternative medicine websites are trying to market alternative therapies to anthrax .
the washington homeopathic products website instructs people who believe that they have been exposed to anthrax to see a licensed healthcare provider immediately .
and the president of the national centre for homeopathy , todd rowe , counselled people to avoid panic .

hundreds of websites have sprung up selling everything from mail sterilisers to oregano oil to prevent and treat illnesses such as anthrax .
but now the us government is cracking down on dozens of websites that it claims are selling unproven products to counter bio-terrorism threats .
the federal trade commission has sent some 40 e-mails to the operators of such websites , telling them to stop marketing such products or face prosecution .
' disturbing sites ' the ftc , the food and drug administration , the california department of health services and the offices of more than 30 state attorneys-general scoured the web for sites selling products that claimed to protect or counter biological and chemical agents .
the internet search uncovered more than 200 sites marketing bio-terrorism related products including gas masks , protective suits , mail sterilizers , biohazard test kits , homeopathic remedies and dietary supplements .
essentially , these operators need to shut down these areas of their sites or face prosecution howard beales , the federal trade commission the sites are claiming that dietary supplements such as colloidal silver , zinc mineral water , thyme and oregano oil are effective treatments for illnesses such as anthrax .
but the ftc said it was aware of no scientific proof for such claims .
and john taylor with the food and drug administration 's office of enforcement said that no products being marketed as dietary supplements had proven safe and effective in the treatment of anthrax .
" together with the ftc , we 've found quite a number of disturbing sites , " mr taylor said .
" companies marketing unapproved or otherwise misbranded products for anthrax or other diseases run a very high risk of fda enforcement or regulatory action . "
the ftc said that opportunistic online marketers are preying on the fears of the public .
the us government has shut down foreign websites illegally selling the antibiotic cipro " this marketing targets people worried about the prospect of exposure to lethal biological or chemical weapons , " said howard beales , the ftc 's director of consumer protection .
and the us government is working with state and local authorities to close down sites that are using worries over bio-terrorism to make money selling ineffective products .
washington attorney-general christine gregoire said state attorneys-general " will not stand by while website operators capitalise on public fears by selling products that offer no protection . "
buyer beware not all homeopathic or alternative medicine websites are trying to market alternative therapies to anthrax .
the washington homeopathic products website instructs people who believe that they have been exposed to anthrax to see a licensed healthcare provider immediately .
and the president of the national centre for homeopathy , todd rowe , counselled people to avoid panic .
echoing the warnings of government officials , he said " the internet is full of books and products capitalising on this fear " .
but the ftc said the public should be aware of online marketers peddling miracle treatments and cures including exotic potions and pills , special curative diets , and strange magnetic or electrical devices .
they stressed that the only known effective treatment for anthrax and smallpox are approved prescription drugs and vaccines , and they urged the public to consult their health care professional before taking any medications .

a police spokesman said the 12 were killed in two different incidents in the state 's jammu region .
he alleged that four of them were pakistani nationals while eight others were suspected to be bangladeshi .
the violence came a day after a member of a leading kashmiri militant group , the hizbul mujahideen , said the groupt was ready to declare a ceasefire if india agreed to a three-way dialogue on kashmir .
however , the comments were subsequently disowned by the group 's operations commander , saifullah .
and india itself has rejected the inclusion of any additional party , including pakistan , in such peace efforts in the past .
' no taleban link ' the hizbul mujahideen also dismissed allegations that taleban fighters fleeing afghanistan would join them in fighting the indian security forces .
a spokesman for the group , asad yazdani , said the allegations were part of india 's propaganda aimed at linking the movement in kashmir with international terrorism .
recent indian media reports said the defeated taleban fighters were re-grouping in pakistan , from where they could enter kashmir to support a muslim insurgency .
the spokesman said that foreign militants were active in kashmir , but that his groups struggle had no links to the taleban or the al-qaeda network of osama bin laden .
" our movement is an indigenous one and we want to take it to the logical end through indigenous means , " he said .
he added that the foreign militants should work under local leadership .
" groups like lashkar-e-taiba , jaish-e-mohammad and harkat-ul-ansar should have no role in policy making related to the kashmir issue , " mr yazdani said .
the us government has placed all three groups on its list of terrorist organisations .

lord simon , writing in the financial times , also says although the government 's prepare-and-decide policy on britain 's membership of the single currency is clear it risks being " shrouded by spin " .
unable to decide which way they face , labour 's politics on the euro are like a kipper - two faces and no spine matthew taylor liberal democrats he attacks as " paltry " the £ 9.9m spent so far on raising public and business awareness of the 1 january euro switchover in much of europe and warns that " negligence " on the practical question of preparedness has become a commercial vulnerability .
downing street brushed aside the remarks , saying lord simon 's position on the issue was well-known .
the prime minister 's official spokesman added : " in terms of his specific criticism , i think on this occasion we will disagree with him . "
lord simon 's broadside comes just a day after prime minister tony blair - in an address to germany 's socialist party , the spd - hinted at his belief that staying outside the euro would harm britain in the long term .
mr blair 's avowed support for the single currency has in the past been interpreted as being out of line with his chancellor , gordon brown , most recently with contrasting speeches made at the confederation of british industry annual conference .
' clear ' policy but lord simon - minister for trade and competitiveness in europe between 1997 and 1999 - said there were only " apparent " government splits and the policy of assessing the five economic tests for british membership and holding a referendum if they were met was " very clear " .
" unfortunately , the clarity of this policy is regularly shrouded by spin , " he writes in wednesday 's ft .
it also obscures real world concerns , he says , most pertinently the fact that only 41 days remain until euro notes and coins are introduced .
" while the spin doctors squabble , the clock is ticking .
" the negligence on the practical question of preparedness for the euro is a vulnerability in commercial terms .
" the serious consequences of this limp effort will become clear only after january 1 . "
tourist trade lord simon says holidaymakers will have a right to be angry at the lack of information they were given when they find their hoarded european currencies are useless by the time they head for the sun next summer .
he points out that , apart from british companies doing business on continental europe and british tourists holidaying there , some 13m tourists from the eurozone could be expected to visit the uk next year .
hotels , transport companies , tourist attractions and shops ready to accept their euros would enjoy an advantage over those that were not .
but without " wholehearted , high-profile " public backing for euro preparations from the government it was not surprising that many companies had not even thought about the issue .
euro membership ' not inevitable ' british membership of the euro was not inevitable , he adds , but it was inevitable that the euro would become the most important foreign currency in britain and the country had to be prepared .
liberal democrat treasury spokesman matthew taylor blamed government divisions for inadequate moves towards the euro .
" labour 's efforts on the euro are limp because they are utterly divided between blairites and brownites .
" unable to decide which way they face , labour 's politics on the euro are like a kipper - two faces and no spine . "

traders read the banks ' downbeat statements as signs that the country 's banking sector is moving closer to sort out its bad debt problem .
the 14 biggest banks in japan are believed to have non-performing loans worth up to 6 trillion japanese yen -lrb- £ 34.5bn ; $ 48.9bn -rrb- .
traditionally , japanese banks have used creative accounting to avoid revealing the extent of any losses in their balance sheets .
but investors have become increasingly aware of the practice , and banks ' financial difficulties have been well documented .
" banks often hide these things only to fuel fears about their financial health , " said ufj capital markets securities general manager of equities sales kazuyuki naito .
" but asahi disclosed its inner facts and showed how to deal with them .
" asahi 's statement is expected to be a flood of admissions of losses by japan 's banks .

stock in the country 's number two bank , sumitomo mitsui banking corporation , also rose , gaining 5.0 % to 732 yen .
new law the banks ' admissions coincided with the introduction of a law that will limit the banks ' shareholdings in a bid to insulate them from the volatility of the stock markets .
as part of the bill 's introduction , japan will set up a state-backed vehicle that will buy shares held by banks to prevent their equity sales from hitting the stock market .
the banks must sell shares worth 10 trillion yen before the law comes into effect in 2004 .
banks that sell their shares to the share-buying vehicle will have to pay an 8 % handling fee .
losses from the share transactions over and above the fee will be paid by the government , though the banks will contribute 10bn yen to the scheme .
japan 's banks are heavily exposed to the country 's sliding stock market .
this is a direct consequence of a culture which has encouraged banks and client companies to hold shares in each other as a way of building strong business links .

but the report , published by the british thoracic society , claims the government is not giving respiratory problems the priority they need .
pauline purvis was diagnosed as suffering from emphysema 10 years ago .
for seven years the only treatment available to her was steroid treatment which had terrible side effects and did not make a significant difference .
but two-and-a-half years ago mrs purvis underwent lung reduction surgery after taking part in clinical trials .
she says the operation , which involved cutting out the diseased part of her lungs , transformed her life - but not everyone is so lucky .
this is her story : " ten years ago my life was not nice .
as anyone with lung disease will know , at times it can be quite frightening because you can not breathe at all .
it means that you can not walk very far .
you are so restricted in what you can and can not do .
stairs are a problem , so you need to think ahead and if there are going to be stairs you have to find an alternative route .
the problem with something like emphysema is that it is an invisible disease .
you can look perfectly well but in fact you are probably feeling ghastly .
but the operation gave me my life back .
beforehand i was crawling up stairs , unable to get up without having to stop and take a rest .
last november i actually walked 330 steps to the top of big ben .
the sad thing is there is so little treatment available for sufferers .
i think i have been one of the very lucky ones .
and because it -lrb- the operation -rrb- did so much for me i just wish passionately that everybody was given the same opportunity .
i think respiratory disease is treated as a poor relation when it comes to funding and i think much more investment is needed . "

he is almost as old as i am .
the poor beast has no mate and he is ageing fast sheragha omar zoo director over the years , many animals have died of starvation , and many of those who survived were themselves eaten when food was short at the height of the country 's relentless civil war .
the zoo 's wild boar is still alive - spared due to an islamic ban on eating pork .
but hathi the elephant did not make it .
a rocket launched during the civil war by one of the rival factions landed in the zoo , and the blast killed the 25-year-old female .
the taleban , who took kabul by storm in 1996 , were initially sceptical that a zoo was compatible with their fundamentalist brand of islam .
but after some deliberation , the theological department of kabul university confirmed that the prophet mohammad had himself kept house pets , and that animals could be educational .
blasted lion zoo director sheragha omar , who has not been paid in four months , hopes that the international attention focused on afghanistan could bring about a reversal of fortunes for the few sorry beasts that remain in his care .
he wants a dignified end for the 45-year-old marjan , whom he says is still " traumatised from his brush with death " .
in the early 1990s , an afghan fighter apparently showing off in front of his friends jumped into marjan 's cage .
the lion promptly bit his arm off and the man died later in hospital .
seeking revenge , the dead man 's friend returned to the zoo and threw a grenade at the lion , which tore into his legs and blew off a side of his muzzle .
marjan was blinded in the left eye .
" he is almost as old as i am .
the poor beast has no mate and he is ageing fast , " said mr omar .
there is neither the money nor the expertise to treat the blistering open sore on the nose of the afghan bear in the zoo the zoo used to be a favourite among bored taleban soldiers on leave from the frontline that used to be north of kabul .
the zookeeper says he was powerless to prevent them beating the bear and other animals with sticks and pelting them with snowballs and stones .
peeking out mr omar is doubtful that the northern alliance , which seized kabul from the taleban last week , have either the interest or the resources to fund the zoo .
he currently relies on the good will of the local butcher , who provides meat for marjan 's daily feeding , and the veterinary knowledge of teachers and students at kabul university .
since the taleban fell from power in the capital , afghans are daring to show more of an interest in their local menagerie .
" people are no longer afraid to come out , " said mr omar .
" we even have women now who open their burqa masks for a better look . "

he is almost as old as i am .
the poor beast has no mate and he is ageing fast sheragha omar zoo director over the years , many animals have died of starvation , and many of those who survived were themselves eaten when food was short at the height of the country 's relentless civil war .
the zoo 's wild boar is still alive - spared due to an islamic ban on eating pork .
but hathi the elephant did not make it .
a rocket launched during the civil war by one of the rival factions landed in the zoo , and the blast killed the 25-year-old female .
the taleban , who took kabul by storm in 1996 , were initially sceptical that a zoo was compatible with their fundamentalist brand of islam .
but after some deliberation , the theological department of kabul university confirmed that the prophet mohammad had himself kept house pets , and that animals could be educational .
blasted lion zoo director sheragha omar , who has not been paid in four months , hopes that the international attention focused on afghanistan could bring about a reversal of fortunes for the few sorry beasts that remain in his care .
zoo director sheragha omar has not been paid in four months he wants a dignified end for the 45-year-old marjan , whom he says is still " traumatised from his brush with death " .
in the early 1990s , an afghan fighter apparently showing off in front of his friends jumped into marjan 's cage .
the lion promptly bit his arm off and the man died later in hospital .
seeking revenge , the dead man 's friend returned to the zoo and threw a grenade at the lion , which tore into his legs and blew off a side of his muzzle .
marjan was blinded in the left eye .
" he is almost as old as i am .
the poor beast has no mate and he is ageing fast , " said mr omar .
there is neither the money nor the expertise to treat the blistering open sore on the nose of the afghan bear in the zoo the zoo used to be a favourite among bored taleban soldiers on leave from the frontline that used to be north of kabul .
the zookeeper says he was powerless to prevent them beating the bear and other animals with sticks and pelting them with snowballs and stones .
peeking out mr omar is doubtful that the northern alliance , which seized kabul from the taleban last week , have either the interest or the resources to fund the zoo .
afghans have been enjoying their local zoo he currently relies on the good will of the local butcher , who provides meat for marjan 's daily feeding , and the veterinary knowledge of teachers and students at kabul university .
since the taleban fell from power in the capital , afghans are daring to show more of an interest in their local menagerie .
" people are no longer afraid to come out , " said mr omar .
" we even have women now who open their burqa masks for a better look . "

it was comfortably ahead of its closest rival , the australian entry aurora , which will not make it to the same point until thursday morning .
nuna covered the three-thousand-kilometre distance from darwin to adelaide in 32 hours and 39 minutes .
this just beat the record for the race set by the honda dream car in 1996 at 33 hrs and 32 mins .

the much-loved wide boy , del boy trotter , played by david jason , was to be seen winning a place on the hit quiz show during a new only fools and horses christmas special .
but a row between the bbc , which makes fools and horses , and itv , which is behind millionaire ? has meant that the collaboration will not happen .
itv demanded the right to show a repeat of the only fools and horses episode in exchange for allowing the bbc to " borrow " the quiz show 's format and featuring presenter chris tarrant .
but the bbc said the scene featuring who wants to be a millionaire ? would last five only minutes and refused .
any traces of goodwill that might have been present during the traditionally fierce christmas ratings battle have now evaporated .
it would have been fantastic to put the ratings war aside for one day john sullivan writer " the scene featuring millionaire was one of a number of ideas written by john sullivan for the christmas special , " a bbc spokesman said .
" however , it would be impossible for the bbc to use licence fee payers ' money to provide a repeat for a five-minute scene . "
an itv spokeswoman said : " we were very happy in principle to help with the idea but on the basis that we were able to repeat the episode later once the bbc had shown it .
" but they were unwilling to do that . "
john sullivan said he had hoped the two broadcasters could put aside their differences for the one-off special .
" like the british and german armies playing football on christmas day in the first world war , it would have been fantastic to put the ratings war aside for one day , " he said .
linchpin three new episodes of only fools and horses will be screened on bbc one over the festive period - the only new shows made since the long-running comedy officially ended five years ago .
it became one of the best-loved shows in the country , with its christmas specials often being the linchpin of bbc one 's yuletide schedule .
the last episode of the show to date , screened on 29 december 1996 , attracted 22.1 million viewers - topping the ratings chart .
del boy and his brother rodney trotter , played by nicholas lyndhurst , finally realised their dream of becoming millionaires after unearthing a valuable watch during that episode .
it was reported earlier this year that david jason , who has also found success with a touch of frost and the darling buds of may , would be paid £ 100,000 per episode for the comeback .
other members of the original cast , including john challis and sue holderness , who play boycie and marlene , have agreed to work in the new episodes - as has roger lloyd-pack , as trigger .
kenneth macdonald , who played mike the landlord in the nag 's head , died earlier this year , while buster merryfield , who played albert , died two years ago .
seven series of the show ran between 1981 and 1991 and the show has its own appreciation society , which claims 6,000 members .

an itv spokeswoman said : " we were very happy in principle to help with the idea but on the basis that we were able to repeat the episode later once the bbc had shown it .
" but they were unwilling to do that . "
john sullivan said he had hoped the two broadcasters could put aside their differences for the one-off special .
" like the british and german armies playing football on christmas day in the first world war , it would have been fantastic to put the ratings war aside for one day , " he said .
linchpin three new episodes of only fools and horses will be screened on bbc one over the festive period - the only new shows made since the long-running comedy officially ended five years ago .
it became one of the best-loved shows in the country , with its christmas specials often being the linchpin of bbc one 's yuletide schedule .
only fools and horses became a hit in the 1980s the last episode of the show to date , screened on 29 december 1996 , attracted 22.1 million viewers - topping the ratings chart .
del boy and his brother rodney trotter , played by nicholas lyndhurst , finally realised their dream of becoming millionaires after unearthing a valuable watch during that episode .
it was reported earlier this year that david jason , who has also found success with a touch of frost and the darling buds of may , would be paid £ 100,000 per episode for the comeback .
other members of the original cast , including john challis and sue holderness , who play boycie and marlene , have agreed to work in the new episodes - as has roger lloyd-pack , as trigger .
kenneth macdonald , who played mike the landlord in the nag 's head , died earlier this year , while buster merryfield , who played albert , died two years ago .
seven series of the show ran between 1981 and 1991 and the show has its own appreciation society , which claims 6,000 members .

first minister in waiting jack mcconnell has promised labour 's lib dem coalition partners " demonstrable " progress on introducing proportional representation for council elections .
lib dem leader jim wallace told bbc scotland 's good morning scotland programme he was confident that proportional representation would come soon .
the 2003 local election could be the last under first past the post the lib dems were given assurances on change in their meeting with mr mcconnell on tuesday night ahead of the vote for first minister on thursday .
but as scotland 's power-brokers were savouring the pledge , nationalists made moves on wednesday to embarrass them .
scottish national party local government spokeswoman tricia marwick is due to launch a parliamentary member 's bill with the aim of legislating to bring in pr in local elections .
such a move could cause problems for lib dem msps who would be faced with the choice of supporting the nationalists on an issue they hold dear or staying loyal to their labour coalition partners .
timetable meanwhile , scots tory leader david mcletchie mocked the lib dems who welcomed the outcome of their meeting with mr mcconnell .
mr mcconnell , who needs lib dem support to be elected as first minister by the parliament on thursday , pledged to deliver a timetable mapping out the next steps to pr .
but mr mcletchie said that mr mcconnell , like previous first ministers , was " stringing along " the lib dems .
david mcletchie : " stringing them along " he said : " we are now talking about progress about progress .
" it just shows that these lib dem lackeys are very easily strung along for the sake of a few ministerial jobs . "
in a statement issued after wednesday 's meeting , mr mcconnell said : " labour and the lib dems remain firmly committed to progress on electoral reform and my job is to make sure that progress is made and seen to be made .
" i am clear that the next steps should be taken with urgency and i will make it a priority to deliver a timetable for those next steps . "
and he told reporters there would be discussions within the labour and lib dem groups before christmas on what that timetable could be .
strong believer mr wallace said the promised progress could result in the 2003 local elections being the last held under the first past the post system .
" that certainly must be the objective .
i very much think the next elections in 2003 will be the last to be fought on first past the post , " he said .
" and i think that 's important - it transcends a single party 's interest in this .
i am a very strong believer in good representative local government . "
mr wallace said there had previously been " misgivings " within his own party and mr mcconnell had admitted demonstrable progress had yet to be made .
he said : " jack mcconnell has indicated that he must now come forward with the next steps and a timetable for that .
" he will come back to both party groups by christmas with details of those next steps and a timetable .
" there is a sense of urgency and priority there that my colleagues support , " mr wallace said .

the non-governmental organisations - including save the children , refugees international and mercy corps - say this would ensure the ongoing delivery of urgently-needed food .
the ngos are due to make a formal announcement in washington later on wednesday .
food is now getting into afghanistan but aid agencies are finding it difficult to move it to remote areas .
they are worried about the plight of those in the remote northern provinces and in the central highlands .
afghanistan has suffered from a three-year long drought and six million people depend on aid .
the agencies say the main obstacle to transporting supplies is not the winter weather or the terrain but the lack of stability .
un not keen a spokesman for refugees international said they wanted a multinational force sanctioned by the un to go into afghanistan as soon as possible to establish order there .
he said many countries were apparently willing to take part and it could be set up quickly .
this would not be the same as a peacekeeping force and would operate in areas where there was the greatest need .
the spokesman said they were also increasingly concerned about the plight of thousands of people displaced by the bombardments who had fled their homes and were living in tents or out in the open .
the un has never sounded keen on sending in any kind of force .
the deputy representative for afghanistan , francesc vendrell , said they backed the idea of a multinational force going to afghanistan but that it should be a coalition of the willing , organised by one country and not by the un .

people in remote areas need food they are worried about the plight of those in the remote northern provinces and in the central highlands .
afghanistan has suffered from a three-year long drought and six million people depend on aid .
the agencies say the main obstacle to transporting supplies is not the winter weather or the terrain but the lack of stability .
un not keen a spokesman for refugees international said they wanted a multinational force sanctioned by the un to go into afghanistan as soon as possible to establish order there .
he said many countries were apparently willing to take part and it could be set up quickly .
this would not be the same as a peacekeeping force and would operate in areas where there was the greatest need .
the spokesman said they were also increasingly concerned about the plight of thousands of people displaced by the bombardments who had fled their homes and were living in tents or out in the open .
the un has never sounded keen on sending in any kind of force .
the deputy representative for afghanistan , francesc vendrell , said they backed the idea of a multinational force going to afghanistan but that it should be a coalition of the willing , organised by one country and not by the un .

after the drama of our accident on monday , wednesday thankfully went very well .
in fact , mad dog surpassed itself and drove over 600 kilometres -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- , the furthest it has ever gone in one single day , with an average speed of 73 km / h -lrb- 45 mph -rrb- .
mad dog also beat its own speed record , reaching a maximum of 100 km / h -lrb- 62 mph -rrb- once it had left alice springs .
according to our best pilot , nigel burgess , who drove close to five hours today , " the conditions were close to ideal with beautiful sunny weather and what was originally a cross wind changing into a slight tail wind " .
there 's not much out here ... apart from solar cars we stopped just north of coober pedy , the famous opal mining town of southern australia .
this is going to be our first real night in the outback , with the flat arid land stretching as far as the eye can see .
it 's still very hot at 5pm , when we have to stop the car , but temperatures at night can cool down substantially .
we are currently in 18th position and hoping to gain on the cars ahead tomorrow if we succeed in repeating today 's performance .
if all goes well , we should reach adelaide the day after tomorrow .
martine follain is a communications officer with south bank university 's mad dog team .
bbc news online will be following the progress of mad dog throughout the world solar challenge .
the dutch nuna car has won the world solar challenge in australia .
the solar-powered vehicle crossed the timed finish line on highway 1 on the northern outskirts of adelaide at 17:09 and 20 seconds -lrb- local time -rrb- .
it was comfortably ahead of its closest rival , the australian entry aurora , which will not make it to the same point until thursday morning .
nuna covered the three-thousand-kilometre distance from darwin to adelaide in 32 hours and 39 minutes .
this just beat the record for the race set by the honda dream car in 1996 at 33 hrs and 32 mins .
nuna , run by the alpha centauri team , averaged a speed of 91.81 km / h -lrb- 57.04 mph -rrb- , compared with honda 's average of 89.76 km / h -lrb- 55.77 mph -rrb- .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- little argument over uk rate cut categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 21 november , 2001 , 11:22 gmt little argument over uk rate cut only one member voted against the half-point cut bank of england interest rate chiefs voted eight to one in favour of the cut implemented earlier this month , minutes have revealed .
the half-a-point cut , which brought rates down to 4.0 % , was the seventh this year .
the one dissenter on the bank 's rate setting panel , the monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- , wanted to see a cut of only one quarter of a percentage point .
and one committee member suggested the bank should consider more drastic action , and chop rates by three quarters of a point .
but minutes of the mpc meeting , two weeks ago , said the committee overall felt a half point cut would " do more to underpin confidence domestically " .
few dangers to inflation the last cut in uk rates , implemented on 8 november , came in a week when the us federal reserve and european central bank also trimmed rates by a half percentage point .
ian plenderleith was the only mpc member to vote for a quarter point cut the uk cut was the third since the 11 september attacks , and the committee admitted it may , at a previous meeting , have underestimated the implications of the strikes for the uk economy .
with the uk economy slowing , the bank said that a cut of half a percentage point , or 50 basis points in city parlance , posed little danger of stoking inflation .
" given the prospects for inflation , there was almost no risk that the committee would want , in the near term , to reverse a 50 basis point reduction , " the minutes said .
the mpc has a government-set target of keeping underlying inflation at 2.5 % .
figures last week showed inflation holding steady at 2.3 % .
stronger action mooted only one mpc member - ian plenderleith - shunned the half point cut , and voted in favour of a quarter point move .
but the minutes reveal that one - unnamed - member suggested the committee could consider stronger action in the form of a three-quarter point cut , given the weakening global economy .
the idea was rejected over fears of " potentially damaging , rather than bolstering , confidence and causing volatility in the financial markets " .
more rate cuts ?
the proposal of a deeper cut could herald further reductions in the future , one analyst said .
" the fact that you have one member gunning for 75 basis points ... makes another rate cut more likely , " bank of america 's chief economist jeremy hawkins told bbc news online .
he said while it was unlikely the mpc at their next meeting would order a further reduction , a quarter point cut could be on the cards in january .
another analyst was more cautious .
" my best guess is that we 're at the floor , but it 's impossible to be hard on that , " said geoffrey dicks , chief uk economist at rbs financial markets .
mr dicks highlighted confidence , among both consumers and businesses , as a pointer to whether further rate cuts would be implemented .
