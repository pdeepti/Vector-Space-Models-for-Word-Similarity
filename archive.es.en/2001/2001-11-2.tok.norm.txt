the new integrated control centre -lrb- icc -rrb- has been constructed in banbury , oxfordshire by chiltern at a cost of £ 1m .
the company says it is the first purpose-built control centre in the privatised railway network .
it will be operational 24 hours a day and enable different rail companies to share real-time information from a common source .
route control critics of privatisation have pointed to the subsequent division of responsibility between different arms of the industry as a reason for poor management of the network .
chiltern says its new centre will bring together the owner of the track and signalling infrastructure , those responsible for track maintenance , and other train operating companies .
the company runs passenger service on rail lines between the midlands , oxfordshire , and london .
functions co-ordinated from the icc will include operational control of the route , fleet management , and passenger information .
chiltern will work closely with railtrack , maintenance contractors amey , and train operators virgin trains and freightliner .
thames trains , which also runs services through the banbury area , will also liaise with staff at the new nerve centre .
adrian shooter , chiltern railways managing director , said : " it is more of a challenge running an efficient railway when the people responsible for different parts of the service and the infrastructure are not able to easily share information and make joint decisions in consultation with each other .
' better information ' " our new integrated control centre has been designed and equipped to ensure that everybody involved in providing our service to passengers , and the other operators on this section of the line , are working with common information and joint decision-making procedures . "
" we all look forward to reduced delays , better co-operation and co-ordination when delays do happen from time to time , and much better information for passengers . "
railtrack midlands director richard fearn said : " i am confident the integration of our controllers will further enhance what has already been recognised as the country 's leading rail route . "
chiltern railways and railtrack jointly won the " best rail route " prize at the 2001 national rail awards .
