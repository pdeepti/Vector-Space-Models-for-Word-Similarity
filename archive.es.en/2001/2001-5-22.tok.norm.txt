the scientists say troops exposed to du may absorb far more radiation than the annual permitted dose , but they believe the increased death risk from radiation-induced cancer is very small . "
a good deal is known scientifically about du ; it is also clear that a good deal remains to be learned " royal society report however , they urge more research to clear up the considerable uncertainty over du 's effects .
in a report for the royal society , the british academy of sciences , scientists say : " a good deal is known scientifically about du ; it is also clear that a good deal remains to be learned . "
the first part of the report deals with the amounts of du to which soldiers could be exposed , du 's radiological effects , and the lessons of epidemiological studies .
the second , still unpublished , will cover du 's health effects linked to its properties as a toxic heavy metal , and its environmental impacts .
three situations du was used by allied forces in the 1991 gulf war and later in bosnia and kosovo .
it is the by-product of enriching natural uranium for civil and military use .
it is 1.7 times as dense as lead , and is used in munitions where its kinetic energy allows it to punch through tanks and other armoured vehicles .
the authors of the royal society report consider three situations they describe as " generic " .
level one : concerns people in a vehicle struck by a du round , or who enter a struck vehicle immediately : they will probably inhale du dust or be hit by shrapnel .
level two : typically involves people working on or in contaminated vehicles who inhale or ingest du dust .
level three : " includes all other exposures , for example during combat being downwind of impacts or fires " .
for each level , the authors provide both a central -lrb- probable -rrb- estimate of du intakes , and a worst-case estimate .
they say : " the central estimate radiation doses are less than 0.1 msv -lrb- millisieverts -rrb- , except for the level one inhalation exposure , which is about 20msv , corresponding to the annual dose limit for workers in the uk . "
but they add : " the worst-case doses for level one and two inhalation exposures are substantial at around 1 sv -lrb- sievert -rrb- " .
on dust inhalation , they say it seems likely that worst-case intakes of more than one gram of du are possible .
turning to the link between radiation and cancer , they put the worst-case excess risk of fatal lung cancer from level one dust inhalation at 6.5 per hundred -lrb- a 6.5 % increased chance of dying of cancer in an individual 's lifetime -rrb- .
this , they say , would mean a soldier exposed to that much du would have a risk of dying of cancer at the age of 75 roughly twice that of the general population .
research needed for level two , the risk is 2.4 per 100 .
the authors find backing for their low estimate of du 's risks in the epidemiological studies of uranium miners and others who work with the substance . "
the epidemiological studies ... provide some support for our views that exposure to du is unlikely to increase greatly the risks of cancer " royal society they say : " there is no evidence of a significant increase in deaths from any cause , or from all cancers , or individual types of cancer , in the large cohorts of uranium workers whose health has been monitored . "
and they add : " the epidemiological studies thus provide some support for our views that exposure to du is unlikely to increase greatly the risks of cancer . "
but they say children need to be aware of the slightly increased skin cancer risk from long exposure to du fragments .
and they urge more research to " help in assessing the hazards that may arise from the use of du " .

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- business failure hits nine-year high low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo tuesday , 22 may , 2001 , 06:57 gmt 07:57 uk business failure hits nine-year high the insolvency rate is at a nine-year high an independent report on business bankruptcy has concluded that the rate of company failure in scotland is at its highest for nearly nine years .
the report by business advisers , grant thornton , says more scottish companies went into liquidation in the first four months of 2001 than at any other time since the final quarter of 1992 .
the firm says the figures " are the early signs of growing problems within the scottish economy " .
it is almost certain that opposition parties will seize on the report as the state of the economy north of the border continues to be a central theme in the general election campaign .
construction is having a " hard time " the insolvency survey concluded that there had been a 36 % increase -lrb- rising from 92 to 102 -rrb- in the number of court liquidations between the last quarter of 2000 and the first quarter of 2001 .
it also concluded that there had been a 4.9 % increase in the number of creditors ' voluntary liquidations over the same period .
these figures , according to grant thornton partner , matt henderson , point towards tough times for the scottish economy .
mt henderson said : " anecdotally people have mentioned that there has been an increased number of corporate insolvencies since the turn of the year and these figures certainly back this up .
" if you look at the figures for liquidations of scottish companies over the last three years , you find a fairly static number of corporate failures .
' indications of recession ' " however , the first quarter figure for 2001 indicates some worrying signs of a slow down in the scottish economy and the first possible indications of recession . "
mr henderson said the failures seemed to be across all sections of the economy but he said that construction , manufacturing , wholesale and retail continued to " have a hard time " .
he added : " looking forward we would expect additional pressures of the foot-and-mouth epidemic to be evident on business dependent on rural access , such as country hotels , shops and restaurants .
" we believe that the headline stories about larger firms such as motorola may be concealing an underlying trend of serious difficulties amid the small mid-tier companies and that these figures are the early signs of growing problems within the scottish economy . "

the author , who worked in soviet labour camps for over 30 years , has created an encyclopedia of inmates ' tattoos .
dozens of publishers rejected the project .

criminal record the author , major dantsig baldmayev , says tattoos are a passport , an autobiography and a criminal record rolled into one .
