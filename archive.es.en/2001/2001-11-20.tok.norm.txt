barclays in london said employees , including the managing director of barclays france , henri-paul pelligrino - are assisting police with their inquiries .
court officials in paris said mr pelligrino and two other senior executives were being investigated on suspicion of involvement in a franco-israeli money laundering network .
the allegations centre on barclays managers failing to carry out proper controls on suspicious cheques which were sent to israel in exchange for cash .
none of the barclays officials have been charged with any offences .
rabbis questioned magistrates are looking into a network which between 1996 and this year allegedly used jewish associations based in france to process illegally-acquired money , according to the french news agency afp .
it said about 80 people - including six rabbis - are under investigation .
anti-money laundering officials are also examining two other banks in france as part of their investigation .
barclay 's senior managers were in late-night crisis talks on monday .
" we take the prevention of money laundering very seriously and will continue to do all we can to assist , " said jo wright , a spokeswoman for the bank in the uk .
" we 're trying to piece together the story at this end , " she said .

the aim of the initiative , the result of talks between government and opposition leaders , is to try to fill the gaping hole left by sliding imports by boosting domestic consumption .
exports from korea are expected this year to fall to their second-worst level since 1980 , as a result of the slowdown afflicting key export markets such as the us .
on the cheap the cuts to so-called " special consumption taxes " mean that , for instance , korea 's most expensive domestic car , the hyundai equus limousine , could cost 3.6m won -lrb- £ 1,990 ; $ 2,826 -rrb- less .
while cars with engines larger than 2 litres will see the tax fall from 14 % to 10 % of purchase price , a reduction applicable until june next year , the cuts announced for taxes on some household goods are bigger , and indefinite .
the tax rate on air conditions , golfing equipment and jewellery will fall from 30 % to 20 % .
on wide-screen tvs , levies will be cut from 15 % to 10 % .
slowdown the move follows a slowdown in the korean economy , which last year grew at a breakneck rate of 8.8 % .
for 2001 as a whole , expansion is thought unlikely to climb above 3 % , and could be rather worse .
exports in october fell for the eighth month in succession .
unsurprisingly , then , business and analysts welcomed the tax cuts .
" we can hardly expect an early recovery in the global economy , " said jun min-kyoo , an economist at hyundai economic research institute .
" boosting local demand should serve as a buffer for the slowing economy . "
but others warned that further action will be needed to boost exports .
domestic demand alone , they said , could not carry the economy through the slowdown .
the government is planning to spend an extra 6,700bn won to help prop up the economy .

the bid came as the international monetary fund set a date to visit buenos aires to discuss further loans , and as jobless workers renewed protests over austerity measures designed to protect argentina 's faltering public finances .
the alternatives are far worse , not only for argentines but also for our lenders domingo cavallo economy minister the country 's economy minister , domingo cavallo , warned that there was little alternative but to pursue the current economic course .
" the alternatives are far worse , not only for argentines , but also for our lenders , " he said .
debt swap the debt revamp plan would see lenders exchanging government bonds paying double digit interest for securities yielding 7 % or less , so saving the state billions of dollars in payments .
but lenders would be repaid in full within three years , the government said .
some credit agencies have warned , however , that the plan comes close to representing default , and the government has gone to some lengths to attempt to soothe creditors ' nerves .
if the debt swap is unsuccessful , investors are concerned that the country could topple into default , bringing down other developing countries with it .
imf visit the success of the initial restructuring drive , involving $ 60bn of debt held by local creditors , will be known on 26 november , the day the imf delegation is set to arrive in buenos aires .
but imf officials are managing expectations down , not least because argentina looks likely to miss key financial targets which were conditions of the last bailout .
the visit - to study argentina 's economy on the ground - could see the imf stump up a further $ 1.3bn , which would bridge the gap between the $ 6.5bn budget deficit mr cavallo has promised and the $ 7.8bn figure now seen as more likely .
new figures indicated that the tax take in argentina is sliding fast , with the government collecting 17 % less money in the first half of the month compared with the same period last year , a report said .
social protests have also bubbled up again , with some of argentina 's legions of unemployed taking to the streets .
roadblocks went up on key roads nationwide , and unions are planning marches for tuesday .

bbc news -pipe- oscars 2002 -pipe- kodak welcomes the oscars home categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : in depth : oscars 2002 front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 20 november , 2001 , 07:16 gmt kodak welcomes the oscars home preparations are well in hand inside the plush new venue this year 's oscars ceremony on 24 march takes place in its new home , the kodak theater in los angeles - marking a return to the part of town which first staged the ceremony in 1929 .
the bbc 's peter bowes reports .
this year 's oscars ceremony marks the dawning of a new era in the 74-year history of the academy awards .
for the first time , showbusiness 's most prestigious awards show has a permanent home - the kodak theater .
the theatre is located at one of la 's best known intersections - the corner of hollywood boulevard and highland avenue .
here it is part of a glittering $ 615m -lrb- £ 424m -rrb- entertainment complex designed to breath new life into rundown hollywood .
as the name implies , the development received substantial financial backing from the kodak company .
the kodak theater received a fanfare opening the complex also includes dozens of stores , a 640-room , four-star hotel and a multi-screen cinema which is an extension to the legendary chinese theater next door .
the move to the traditional heart of hollywood , away from downtown venues like the shrine auditorium and the dorothy chandler pavilion , will bring a number of benefits .
the new theatre is purpose built for the occasion and incorporates hi-tech broadcast facilities necessary to beam the show to an estimated global audience of one billion people .
the hollywood location also makes the venue more accessible for the stars .
it is a short-hop limousine drive from most celebrities ' homes in the nearby hollywood hills and leafy beverly hills .
above all , the new venue is viewed as bringing the oscars back home .
tourism the first ever academy awards presentation , a relatively low-key , black-tie dinner , took place at the hollywood roosevelt hotel on 16 may , 1929 .
the hotel , a cherished hollywood landmark , is situated across the street from the new kodak theater and is currently undergoing extensive refurbishment as part of the area 's revitalisation .
while most hollywood studios have now shifted their film-making operations to the outer suburbs of los angeles , or to the dismay of some , away from tinsel town altogether , the paramount studio remains on nearby melrose avenue .
hollywood and highland : a hugely ambitious project the birth of the kodak theater complex is therefore viewed more as an attempt to boost tourism rather than recreate old-style hollywood .
celebrities will no doubt welcome the new theatre 's close proximity to the main oscar party venues .
after an academy awards ceremony lasting up to four hours , followed by the obligatory governor 's ball , most weary stars move on to lavish parties at restaurants in west hollywood .
the kodak theater itself has some limitations compared with the shrine auditorium - the preferred venue in recent years .
the seating capacity will be dramatically reduced - from about 6,500 at the shrine to 3,500 .
some oscars voters - members of the motion picture academy - have expressed concern that they will be denied a seat on hollywood 's biggest night .
application forms but perhaps the most contentious issue , regarding seating arrangements , centres around the new arrangements for the red carpet grand stand .
traditionally , hundreds of die-hard oscars fans have camped out on the streets to gain access to the coveted bleacher seats .
this year , a combination of security concerns and the geography of the new venue , has forced changes .
approximately 400 seats , which will remain free of charge , will be assigned on a first-come , first-served basis to people who fill out an application form in advance .
the academy is requiring people to supply personal information such as name , address , birth date , driver 's licence and social security numbers in addition to a recent passport-size photo .
the move has upset a number of long-time fans - some of whom have been attending the event for more than 30 years .
they have suggested that bleacher veterans should be given preferential treatment when the academy hands out the tickets .
for many , the prize is priceless - a front row seat at the most glamorous show on earth and a photo opportunity worthy of the new picture-perfect venue .
the oscars ceremony will be broadcast live on bbc two on monday 25 march from 0045-0600 gmt and reported live on bbc news online .

the bbc 's peter bowes reports .
this year 's oscars ceremony marks the dawning of a new era in the 74-year history of the academy awards .
for the first time , showbusiness 's most prestigious awards show has a permanent home - the kodak theater .
the theatre is located at one of la 's best known intersections - the corner of hollywood boulevard and highland avenue .
here it is part of a glittering $ 615m -lrb- £ 424m -rrb- entertainment complex designed to breath new life into rundown hollywood .
as the name implies , the development received substantial financial backing from the kodak company .
the complex also includes dozens of stores , a 640-room , four-star hotel and a multi-screen cinema which is an extension to the legendary chinese theater next door .
the move to the traditional heart of hollywood , away from downtown venues like the shrine auditorium and the dorothy chandler pavilion , will bring a number of benefits .
the new theatre is purpose built for the occasion and incorporates hi-tech broadcast facilities necessary to beam the show to an estimated global audience of one billion people .
the hollywood location also makes the venue more accessible for the stars .
it is a short-hop limousine drive from most celebrities ' homes in the nearby hollywood hills and leafy beverly hills .
above all , the new venue is viewed as bringing the oscars back home .
tourism the first ever academy awards presentation , a relatively low-key , black-tie dinner , took place at the hollywood roosevelt hotel on 16 may , 1929 .
the hotel , a cherished hollywood landmark , is situated across the street from the new kodak theater and is currently undergoing extensive refurbishment as part of the area 's revitalisation .
while most hollywood studios have now shifted their film-making operations to the outer suburbs of los angeles , or to the dismay of some , away from tinsel town altogether , the paramount studio remains on nearby melrose avenue .
the birth of the kodak theater complex is therefore viewed more as an attempt to boost tourism rather than recreate old-style hollywood .
celebrities will no doubt welcome the new theatre 's close proximity to the main oscar party venues .
after an academy awards ceremony lasting up to four hours , followed by the obligatory governor 's ball , most weary stars move on to lavish parties at restaurants in west hollywood .
the kodak theater itself has some limitations compared with the shrine auditorium - the preferred venue in recent years .
the seating capacity will be dramatically reduced - from about 6,500 at the shrine to 3,500 .
some oscars voters - members of the motion picture academy - have expressed concern that they will be denied a seat on hollywood 's biggest night .
application forms but perhaps the most contentious issue , regarding seating arrangements , centres around the new arrangements for the red carpet grand stand .
traditionally , hundreds of die-hard oscars fans have camped out on the streets to gain access to the coveted bleacher seats .
this year , a combination of security concerns and the geography of the new venue , has forced changes .
approximately 400 seats , which will remain free of charge , will be assigned on a first-come , first-served basis to people who fill out an application form in advance .
the academy is requiring people to supply personal information such as name , address , birth date , driver 's licence and social security numbers in addition to a recent passport-size photo .
the move has upset a number of long-time fans - some of whom have been attending the event for more than 30 years .
they have suggested that bleacher veterans should be given preferential treatment when the academy hands out the tickets .
for many , the prize is priceless - a front row seat at the most glamorous show on earth and a photo opportunity worthy of the new picture-perfect venue .
the oscars ceremony will be broadcast live on bbc two on monday 25 march from 0045-0600 gmt and reported live on bbc news online .

the company said it lost 54.3bn yen -lrb- £ 307m ; $ 441m -rrb- in the six months to september , having made a profit of 36.3bn yen in the same period last year .
the bulk of the loss came from the slump in internet investments , which softbank said accounted for 34.8bn yen .
another 16bn yen was lost from shareholdings in affiliated companies .
beginning of the end the loss puts the lid on the internet frenzy in japan .
throughout the late 90s , softbank - founded by maverick investor masayoshi son - invested in hundreds of start-up companies .
as they progressed to offering shares to the public , mr son became a multi-billionaire , and his company at one point was worth more than industrial behemoths such as honda and matsushita electric industrial .
yahoo , the internet search engine company , was one early beneficiary of softbank 's investments .
then came the crash , and with it much of mr son 's paper fortune as softbank shares slid more than 60 % in the past year .
the firm now concentrates on providing high-speed internet access .
the tumble has prompted that softbank to order the closure of eight of its 11 offices outside japan , and get rid of 75 staff - two thirds of its overseas workforce .
despite the fall in profitability , softbank sales grew 1.7 % to 183.4bn yen , tuesday 's results statement showed .

the un envoy to afghanistan , lakhdar brahimi , is said to be planning to convene the meeting in berlin on saturday .
it is the first time a date and venue has been specified for the meeting , which is intended to be the first step towards the establishment of a broad-based transitional government for afghanistan following the removal of the taleban from power in kabul .
the sources say mr brahimi is expected to make a formal announcement to the un security council later on tuesday .
meanwhile , officials from about a dozen countries are to meet in washington later to discuss plans for rebuilding afghanistan 's shattered infrastructure .
the united states and japan will host the talks in washington which will examine afghanistan 's most pressing post-war needs , such as agriculture , water and education .
european union foreign ministers have already promised to give reconstruction aid to afghanistan , but only if the country 's new government respected human rights and international law .
mr brahimi 's deputy , francesc vendrell , has so far held three days of talks in kabul with key figures in the northern alliance and other tribal and faction leaders , seeking commitments that they will attend the conference in germany .
although leaders of the northern alliance , which now controls much of afghanistan , are yet to agree to attend , diplomats believe they will eventually go .
bbc un correspondent greg barrow says that it is no small achievement to decide on a date and venue for a meeting , as events on the ground have rapidly overtaken the slow pace of diplomacy .
in other developments : us defense secretary donald rumsfeld says the us opposes any deals to let taleban leader mullah omar escape afghanistan at least four journalists die in afghanistan after gunmen ambush a convoy in which they were travelling george w bush holds a ramadan dinner at the white house for officials from 53 muslim nations kabul 's bakhtar cinema reopens for the first time in five years to a sell-out audience thousands of afghan refugees are continuing to cross into pakistan daily and more are expected , according to the united nations refugee agency authorities in uzbekistan obstruct the first british and french aid deliveries to northern afghanistan the bbc 's matt frei , who has arrived in the southern afghan province of kandahar , says the taleban seem in control but there are thousands of refugees in previously unknown camps the deployment to afghanistan of thousands of british soldiers is delayed after " discouraging " reports from advance troops the prospect of an inter-afghan forum was given a boost after the northern alliance relented in its demand that talks should only take place in the afghan capital , kabul .
the concession followed discussions in uzbekistan between us envoy james dobbins and northern alliance foreign minister abdullah abdullah .
mr vendrell said he was hopeful that agreement could now be reached on a future afghan government .
" one of the reasons why i 'm optimistic this time is that not only are we learning from past experiences , but also the international community this time is fully committed to provide massive rehabilitation and reconstruction to this city , " he told the uk 's guardian newspaper .
mr vendrell said he hoped an interim administration would be set up , followed by elections within three years .
us ' pleased ' the united states , which has led the campaign to topple the taleban , welcomed the northern alliance 's decision .
us secretary of state colin powell said he was " very pleased " and called for talks to be held soon .
the united states and its allies fear that a government dominated by the northern alliance could prompt the kind of factional fighting that ripped kabul apart in the early 1990s .
the international drive to build an interim administration has been gathering pace with the arrival in afghanistan of russian and british delegations .
the international community this time is fully committed to provide massive rehabilitation and reconstruction to this city fransesc vendrell un envoy the russian team arrived in kabul on sunday , while british envoy stephen evans landed at bagram airport near the capital on monday .
correspondents say russia has also shown its determination to play a key role in shaping afghanistan 's future government .
russian defence minister sergei ivanov said the 12-strong delegation was in kabul to help with the political process and that it was time to re-open the russian embassy there .
the team was the first foreign delegation to visit kabul since the collapse of the taleban .
iran , which has close ties to the northern alliance , is also planning to re-establish its diplomatic mission in kabul .
it has already opened a consulate in the western city of herat .
former afghan president burhanuddin rabbani returned to the capital on saturday , five years after being ejected by the taleban .
the ousted leader said the northern alliance had not come to kabul to rule and he would welcome the establishment of a multi-ethnic government .

the governor of the autonomous region for muslim mindanao -lrb- armm -rrb- , nur misuari , has been given two days to explain his actions , following attacks by muslim rebels on the island of jolo .

four soldiers have died and many more have been wounded .
nur misuari is not standing in armm elections a faction of the muslim separatist movement , moro national liberation front -lrb- mnlf -rrb- , said it was abandoning a five-year-old peace agreement , accusing the government of violating the deal by holding elections next week for the region .
a senior philippine military officer , brigadier-general edilberto adan , told the bbc that nur misuari was an isolated man facing almost certain defeat in the polls .

the government demanded that the rebels carry out no further political killings during negotiations but the rebels refused , saying such actions were part of their revolutionary justice system .
over the weekend , 28 people died in the worst clashes for a decade between the communist party 's armed wing , the new people 's army , and the army .
the communist insurgency in the philippines has lasted more than 30 years , with more than 40,000 people killed .

mr bush told the ambassadors that he appreciated their countries ' support for the american-led campaign against terrorism and he emphasised us humanitarian efforts in afghanistan .
as this feast breaks the ramadan fast , america is also sharing our table with the people of afghanistan george w bush he defended his decision to continue the bombing campaign in afghanistan during the muslim holy month , saying : " the terrorists have no home in any faith .
evil had no holy days . "
the white house says it is the first time an american president has played host to such a meal , which marks the end of the dawn-to-dusk fasting period observed by muslims during ramadan .
by hosting the iftar , mr bush hopes to strengthen the support of islamic countries for the coalition against global terrorism .
the us also wants to further isolate saudi-born militant osama bin laden - chief suspect for the 11 september suicide attacks - who accuses america of waging a war against islam .
tribunals defended " i appreciate your support of our objectives in the campaign against terrorism , " mr bush said .
" tonight , that campaign continues in afghanistan , so that the people of afghanistan will soon know peace .
" as this feast breaks the ramadan fast , america is also sharing our table with the people of afghanistan .
" we are proud to play a leading role in humanitarian efforts with air drops and truck convoys of food and medicine .
america 's children are donating their dollars to the afghan children . "
mr bush also defended his decision to try in military tribunals foreigners charged with acts of terror , a move which critics say would mean fewer rights for the accused .
" we are fighting a war against the most evil kinds of people and i need to have that extraordinary option at my fingertips , " mr bush said .
he said the tribunals would also protect potential jurors .
senior us officials at the iftar included secretary of state colin powell , attorney general john ashcroft and national security adviser condoleezza rice .
guests included the syrian ambassador , rostom al-zoubi , and hasan abdel rahman , chief representative of the palestine liberation organisation .
aid put on display libya , iran and iraq did not take part .
before the meal , the ambassadors gathered in the east room of the white house for prayers .
earlier on monday , piles of flour , wheat , cornmeal , blankets and coats of the kind the us is sending to afghanistan were displayed on the lawn of the white house .
spokesman ari fleischer said : " the white house is setting a table , not only for ourselves domestically , but for other nations , for the people of afghanistan . "
