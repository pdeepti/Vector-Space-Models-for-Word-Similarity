the conservation body announced on tuesday it will restore the back-to-back houses near the city centre , which date from 1802 .
the trust said the site will offer a unique insight in to living conditions of previous centuries for schoolchildren and tourists .
some visitors will be able to stay the night in conditions similar to those experienced by the average factory worker in the early 1800s , with a few 21st century modifications .
basic sanitation the properties on inge street are one-room deep and were built to accommodate a rapidly increasing working population in birmingham throughout the 1800s .
the housing became associated with squalor , disease and poverty largely because of its cramped design and poor sanitation .
the houses form a courtyard jason tanner , from the national trust , said the group of about nine dwellings are unusual because they form a courtyard instead of the uniform rows of houses common to slum areas .
the courtyard would have offered fairly basic communal washing facilities but would also have been the focal point of the primitive sanitation system .
he said the houses would make for an unusual overnight stay .
" the idea is to offer some as a short break attraction for tourists who would be able to stay in a back-to-back for a few nights .
" a few modcons will have been put in beforehand - even tourists have certain standards .
" they will reflect just what it was like to live in a back-to-back house . "
period choice it is planned that four houses will be on show which will be decorated in the style of the early 1800s , the late 19th century , pre-war 1930s and the 1960s .
the houses during the early 20th century the properties in the centre of birmingham were only spared demolition because they were used as shops and although unfit for human habitation were allowed to continue to operate as businesses .
" it 's a little historical gem that only survived the ball and chain , which demolished most of the houses like this in birmingham , by default because they were shops , " said mr tanner .
" it will offer a great insight in to how people lived in the past and will be of great interest to school groups - the victorian period is part of the national curriculum . "
the national trust and the birmingham conservation trust will restore the properties with money from the heritage lottery fund .
fiona reynolds , director general of the national trust , said : " at the core of the back-to-backs in birmingham are the stories of the people who lived and worked in these houses from the time they were built to the present day .
" this project will allow us to reveal more of this history . "
elizabeth perkins , administrator of birmingham conservation trust , said : " we have an exciting time ahead as we peel back the layers of filth and decay to discover more about the history of these houses and the people who lived in them . "
the properties are expected to open in 2004 .

the anti-graft court in sandiganbayan said the warrant would be served on the 72-year-old widow of the country 's late president ferdinand marcos on tuesday .
mrs marcos - who was granted bail of $ 2,500 - described the charges as harassment and told the bbc she had been relentlessly persecuted for the past 16 years .
ferdinand marcos was overthrown in 1986 she faces four counts of holding swiss bank accounts containing millions of illegally-acquired dollars under the names of several foundations .
the charges are part of a wider case alleging the marcoses plundered the nation 's economy between 1968 and 1986 , when mr marcos was in power .
the marcos family is also under investigation for human rights abuses .
but when the bbc 's east asia today put it to mrs marcos on tuesday that there was hard documentary evidence against her , she denied the charges .
" absolutely not , " she said .
" sixteen years have passed , this is beyond restrictive time . "
she said there was no proof that she had stolen a single dollar .
conviction quashed the court in sandiganbayan said the accounts in question were set up " for the benefit of the accused and her late husband , then-president ferdinand marcos and their children , with monies amounting to $ 231,366,894 as of 31 december , 1989 " .
mrs marcos was found guilty on corruption charges in the mid-1990s and sentenced to a minimum of 12 years in prison , but the conviction was overturned on appeal .
the marcoses were overthrown in a popular revolt in 1986 and fled to hawaii , where ferdinand marcos died three years later .
mrs marcos returned to the philippines in 1991 when a ban against her was dropped . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's john maclean " marcos is charged with misappropriating millions of dollars in public funds " imelda marcos , talking to east asia today : " sixteen years have passed " see also : 16 feb 01 -pipe- asia-pacific homage to imelda 's shoes 31 oct 00 -pipe- asia-pacific the day i met imelda marcos 08 dec 99 -pipe- asia-pacific philippines cult idolises marcos 06 oct 98 -pipe- asia-pacific imelda marcos acquitted 04 jul 99 -pipe- asia-pacific imelda marcos turns 70 in style 03 aug 01 -pipe- asia-pacific timeline : the philippines internet links : philippines online office of the president of the philippines the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : blaze kills 42 in indonesian bar china vows to overhaul courts koreas trade fresh war of words philippines church apologises for sex abuse search for ' spy ' pilots in china chinese chemical spill kills 13 malaysian state passes islamic law vietnam 's unburied soldiers head home links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

the organisation is holding a public meeting in north wales on tuesday where a leading member will call for a response following " a long , hot summer of debate " .
cymuned was set up in the summer in response to the long-running row about the preservation of the welsh language in the face of english incomers into wales 's rural heartlands .
speakers at the meeting , which will take place at neuadd pantycelyn in aberystwyth , include councillor seimon glyn who first ignited the language row back in february , and dr simon brooks , editor of current affairs monthly magazine barn .
dr brooks is expected to demand that the assembly takes responsibility for the " housing , work and language crisis in welsh-speaking communities " .
" the answers to the crisis lie with housing policy that enables local people buy local homes , adult education for english-speaking newcomers who want to learn welsh , and economic development , " review welcomed the group will welcome the review of the welsh language currently being carried out by the assembly 's culture committee , but it believes that the welsh-speaking communities can not wait another six months for the report to be completed .
" as an emergency measure , we are calling on edwina hart , minister for finance , local government and communities , to release more money into the home buy scheme . "
" this scheme allows local authorities to assist with the financing of up to 50 % of the cost of houses in areas where locals are priced out of the housing market . "
dr brooks will criticise ms hart for only investing £ 1m into the home buy scheme , while planning to spend an additional £ 112m on public services next year .
" in such circumstances , and with extra money obviously available , we are calling for the release of an additional £ 20m to insure the most basic community right of all - the right of local people to have a home . "

stella rimington , who retired as director-general of mi5 in 1996 , said terrorism could never be wiped out altogether .
and she said there could be a repeat of the attack on the world trade center in new york because intelligence networks were not developed enough .
there will always be a risk that terrorist incidents may take place because there is not sufficiently advanced intelligence stella rimington mrs rimington , 65 , was speaking at cheltenham literature festival in gloucestershire to promote her autobiography open secret .
she is the first british spymaster allowed to talk frankly about her experiences in the intelligence services .
she said : " i do not feel incredibly confident about this war against terrorism .
" i think it is encouraging to see there is better , closer collaboration between the world 's intelligence agencies .
" that is quite positive , but rooting out terrorism strikes me as an extremely difficult thing to do .

new groups will come who regard terrorism as very useful in drawing attention to their causes stella rimington mrs rimington , who worked for mi5 for 27 years , said the spy network was not advanced enough to predict exactly when and where terrorists would strike .

mrs rimington has previously defended american intelligence agencies following criticism that they should have found out about , and prevented , the 11 september attacks .
she told an audience in glasgow last week : ' ' it is difficult to get detailed intelligence about precisely when and where terrorist activity is going to take place .
" people who criticise , as they have done , the cia for example , for not having prior intelligence , are barking up the wrong tree . "
mi5 hunt mi5 has become increasingly involved in countering international terrorism since the end of the cold war .
it now devotes more than one fifth of its budget to fighting international terrorism , for which it has reportedly been given extra funds since 11 september .
it has investigated accounts that 11 of the hijackers involved in the attacks passed through britain .
it is also understood to be actively looking in the uk for other members of osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network who may be connected to the suicide hijackers .
muslim cleric shafiq ur rehman , who is to be deported to pakistan accused of supporting terrorism , recently claimed the move was punishment for refusing mi5 attempts to recruit him as an agent .

officials have moved to reassure the public that britain is prepared to deal with any future biological or chemical terrorist attack .
details to be released later in the week will take the form of guidance for the nhs , local authorities and the public from the department of health -lrb- doh -rrb- and the home office .
but government officials are keen to avoid panic as a baby boy and a 73-year-old man become the latest to be infected with anthrax in the us .
on tuesday morning a sorting office in liverpool was evacuated after white powder fell out of a package .
the substance is being tested .
earlier , dave joyce , chairman of the health safety committee of the communication workers ' union , said officials were also trying to avoid panic within the postal service .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " members are being briefed and given adequate information and instruction as to the risk posed by anthrax , and what they should do if a suspect package is encountered ... or possibly broken open by accident . "
the public health laboratory service has already updated its advice on how to deal with a deliberate attempt to spread anthrax .
guidance includes the importance of sealing off what the phls calls " the exposed zone " if anthrax spores are found and decontaminating everyone present .
any infected people would need to take antibiotics for up to eight weeks .
extra supplies chief medical officer professor liam donaldson said on monday that the government has obtained extra supplies of antibiotics to counter any attack .
but he insisted there was no intelligence of any specific threat .
and he said any outbreak of anthrax - such as those which have occurred in the us - would affect only small numbers of people .
" we do n't have any evidence that there is any threat or risk but it is our responsibility to plan and plan well , and that is what we have been doing over the last two weeks , " he told the bbc .
" i think we 're very well prepared ... we have one of the best public health systems in the world . "
professor donaldson said the government has issued reminders to doctors on how to diagnose and treat anthrax .
and the doh has been reviewing its contingency plans for dealing with all public health emergencies .
three tested some uk gps have reported patients coming in worried that they have the disease .
but a spokeswoman for the british medical association said all they would do was reassure the patients that they were very unlikely to have it .
official guidelines mean doctors are unlikely to test anyone for anthrax unless there is a specific incident in which they may have been exposed to the bacteria .
" if somebody did develop symptoms it would be a result of some sort of exposure ... tied to particular incidents , the opening of suspect parcels and so on , " professor donaldson said .
results awaited " so people would be coming to seek help on the basis of a specific incident , not on the basis of feeling generally unwell .
anthrax is not something that spreads from person to person . "
three people have been tested in britain , after working in the us buildings where spores were detected .
they are still awaiting results .
pharmacies in the us report being swamped with demands for the antibiotic cipro , which can be used to treat cutaneous -lrb- skin -rrb- anthrax .
but members of the public trying to take their own preventative measures in the uk are likely to be frustrated .
a spokeswoman for bayer , which makes the drug , told bbc news online it is available only on prescription in the uk - and not licensed for anthrax anyway .
a range of alternative antibiotics are used - but again these are available only on prescription .
anyone asking their doctor for a vaccine is also going to be disappointed .
even private practitioners can not offer it to patients as it is not recommended for the general public , not produced commercially and can not be purchased .

they say the fields affected are no richer in plant and bird species than conventionally farmed land .
with european union -lrb- eu -rrb- spending on environmentally friendly farming set to double before long , the researchers urge a scientifically sound evaluation of its usefulness .
the eu scheme began in 1992 , but the dutch experience goes back to 1981 .
the researchers , from the nature conservation and plant ecology group at wageningen university in the netherlands , report their findings in the magazine nature .
they evaluated agri-environment schemes ' achievements in protecting biodiversity in intensively used dutch farming landscapes by surveying plants , birds , hover flies and bees on 78 pairs of fields .
fewer birds found one of each pair was managed with environmental protection written into a management agreement .
the other was managed conventionally .
the authors write : " management agreements were not effective in protecting the species richness of the investigated groups : no positive effects on plant and bird species diversity were found .
" the four most common wader species were observed even less frequently on fields with management agreements .
" by contrast , however , hover flies and bees showed modest increases in species richness on fields with management agreements . "
dutch farmland is important for meadow birds in general , and especially for waders .
most management agreements pay farmers to delay mowing or grazing their fields until june or july , to allow the chicks to hatch safely .
many also pay them to delay mowing and grazing , and to restrict fertiliser use , to encourage wild plants along field edges .
positive effects with these agreements , the researchers say , they found no significant differences between the two types of field .
they write : " fields with agreements that aimed to support wader populations by postponing first farming activities had lower counts of the target species , lapwing , oystercatcher , common redshank and black-tailed godwit .
" however , management agreements do have a positive effect on reproductive success . "
species richness of hover flies was higher on fields with management agreements than on control fields , and the same applied to bees .
the authors conclude : " most farmers lack the knowledge to judge in what way measures taken to improve the economic position of their farm may interfere with nature conservation measures .
" our findings indicate that it is imperative to evaluate current agri-environment schemes , and to ensure that any new scheme is accompanied by a scientifically sound evaluation plan . "
valid concept dr david gibbons , of the uk 's royal society for the protection of birds , told bbc news online : " it 's an interesting study , and i 'm not entirely surprised at the findings .
" with plants , you 'd have to reduce the nitrogen input much more than the dutch farmers did .
" with birds , breeding success was n't necessarily feeding through into higher population numbers .
" the adult birds may have been taking the chicks elsewhere .
you really need to look on a much bigger scale where birds are concerned .
" the study 's useful : as it says , you have to monitor agri-environment schemes closely and adapt the details to make sure they 're working .
" but i do n't think it devalues the concept .
the uk schemes are now much better than they were 15 years ago . "
about 4 % of the eu 's common agricultural policy spending -lrb- 1.7bn euros , more than £ 1bn -rrb- goes on agri-environment schemes , and the amount is expected to rise to 10 % before long .

major charles ingram - the man at the centre of a police investigation into the itv quiz show who wants to be a millionaire ? - has been arrested over allegations of deception .
the arrest is not related to the tv show - but stems from questions over an insurance claim made on his home , according to reports .
major ingram is currently locked in a legal battle with makers of the hit quiz show after they refused to pay him £ 1m winnings from an episode that has not yet been screened .
scotland yard has been investigating allegations that coughing from the audience could have indicated the answers to him .
" he was arrested in connection with offences of deception and he 's been released on police bail for further enquiries to be made , " a spokesman for wiltshire police told bbc news online .
" it is not connected with who wants to be a millionaire ? "
the arrest was made on monday and he has been bailed to return to salisbury police station on 4 december , the spokesman said .
major ingram , 38 , of upavon , wiltshire , submitted a £ 30,000 claim after he said his home was broken into in august , the sun newspaper reports .
legal action but his insurance company has refused to pay until police are satisfied there has been no wrongdoing , the paper says .
major ingram 's disputed win on who wants to be a millionaire ? has seen him take legal action to force programme-makers to hand over the £ 1m .
he has strenuously denied the allegations that he was helped to win the total by a member of the audience .
a member of the quiz show 's production team reportedly heard coughing in the audience and thought the number of coughs coincided with the number of the correct answer .
