the 26-year-old programmer was arrested last month shortly after presenting a paper to a conference on the encryption methods used to protect electronic books .
mr sklyarov has been indicted on five charges and if found guilty on all of them could face up to 25 years in jail .
the cause of the programmer has been taken up by freedom of speech advocates and cyber libertarians who are planning demonstrations to protest against his arrest and indictment .
copyright controversy mr sklyarov , who is free on $ 50,000 bail but must remain in northern california , was formally charged on wednesday with violating the digital millennium copyright act .
mr sklyarov is the first person to be charged under the dmca , which took effect last year .
the act makes it a crime to distribute tools that can be used to circumvent copyright controls on digital products such as electronic books , encrypted music files and dvds .
on 16 july fbi agents arrested mr sklyarov , who had travelled to the us for a technical conference at which he was to present a paper on the encryption methods some companies have chosen to protect online works .
he was arrested at the urging of adobe which said the advanced ebook processor software that he had co-written , and his employer elcomsoft had been selling , could be used to break the encryption systems being used to stop electronic books being illegally copied .
adobe withdrew its complaints following lobbying by the civil and cyber-liberties group electronic frontier foundation .
however , the us government has pushed on with its prosecution of mr sklyarov .
mr sklyarov has denied the allegations .
" we will vigorously contest these charges , " said mr sklyarov 's lawyer joseph burton of law firm duane morris .
" even if one were to ignore the serious legal questions involving the dmca , this case hardly cries out for criminal prosecution , " he said .
he added that the law firm was working to ensure that mr sklyarov 's wife , two-year-old son and four-month-old daughter travel to california in time for the court appearance .
demonstrations to protest against the treatment of mr sklyarov and the dmca are being planned for thursday .
protesters are due to gather in moscow , london , edinburgh , boston , san francisco , los angeles and in nevada at the annual burning man arts festival .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- get away and work abroad categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 30 august , 2001 , 06:14 gmt 07:14 uk get away and work abroad andrea higgins pictured in malta , where she works for an offshore trust company this is the third part of bbc news online 's " kick-start your career " guide by bbc news online 's personal finance reporter sarah toyne andrea higgins , 28 , is one a growing number of people who are making the most of international work opportunities .
going abroad was just to have a different perspective after having worked in england for most of my life andre seddoh she is a manager at blevins franks trustees , an offshore trust company in malta , and she has worked there for the past 18 months .
andrea says : " i decided to have a change of scene .
a lot of my friends have been travelling around .
living in london was very hectic and i did n't get much free time .
i fancied the sunshine , i was a bit fed-up of the rain " .
even though andrea has lived away from home since she was 18 years old , living abroad has been " a different kettle of fish " .
" working here is not the same as in the uk , you get to learn a lot and experience different ways of working and living .
" it has definitely helped me with my confidence .
living abroad builds-up your personality . "
working abroad if you want to spend some time working abroad like andrea , the first step is to know where to find work .
if you are lucky and work for a large international organisation , you may be able to get a work placement abroad .
alternatively , you can either apply for jobs advertised in newspapers and on websites in the uk or apply directly to a company abroad .
there are an increasing number of websites , such as stepstone , monster and newmonday which advertise international job opportunities .
andre seddoh worked in ghana for two and a half years monster 's global gateway service , for example , offers a raft of information and jobs in different countries around the world .
you can also post your cv on the site .
if you are considering working abroad for a short period of time , you can fix up work through a temping agency before you get there .
manpower , for example , has 3,000 branches worldwide .
if you contact your local branch it will put you in contact with a branch overseas .
alternatively , you can call manpower 's head office in the uk on 020 7224 6688 and ask for " manpower international " .
if you fancy doing something unusual while you are abroad - work as a lifeguard , on a turtle conservation project or as a kayak instructor , hot recruit has a " crazy job " section , aimed at younger people .
you could also become a volunteer with organisation such as voluntary service overseas -lrb- vso -rrb- or the european voluntary service .
vacationwork publishes a large number of books on living and working abroad , including " the international directory of voluntary work " and " the directory of jobs and careers abroad " .
language skills if you are fluent in a foreign language you will have a much better chance of getting a job abroad in countries where english is not the first language .
if you have a second language you can also expect to earn about 20 % more , according to international recruitment consultants angela mortimer .
davide mele , director of the company 's international division , places secretaries in europe .
crazy jobs including caring for turtles at hot recruit he says : " in france , they are very keen on having real english secretaries because their technical skills , such as typing , are much more advanced .
" in big merchant , investment banks and management consultants , many division heads are either english or american and there are a lot of dealings in english . "
however , even people who do not have language skills but aim to live in europe can get help .
you could get work with a foreign company 's branch in the uk and then try and re-locate to europe in the future .
alternatively , if you find that poor language skills are an impediment to working in your chosen country , you could try a job which requires less demanding language skills , such as bar or restaurant work .
teaching english as a foreign language -lrb- tefl -rrb- is one of the most popular options for people who want to work abroad .
it costs between £ 600 and £ 1,000 to take a tefl course .
visas while it is relatively straightforward for british citizens to work in european union member states , it can be more tricky elsewhere .
edward heckels worked in the far east for seven years however , there are a number of useful websites which list visa information as well as more detailed country profiles .
try the prospect site or alternatively , contact the country 's embassy in london .
embassy world has comprehensive listings of embassies around the world .
popular destinations with britons , such as australia , have specialist sites on the web .
other considerations before you decide to move abroad , you will need to weigh up the risks involved , and your responsibilities back home .
career counsellors also advise people to set a timeframe for the trip and their return to the uk .
siobhan hamilton-phillips a senior psychologist at career psychology says : " if you are going abroad , you must plan when you are going to come back , otherwise you can drift and not have any focus .
" if you plan when you will return , going abroad moves away from being a way of escaping or running away , and becomes an adventure . "
tax etc .
edward heckels , 34 , worked in the far east for seven years for an international banking group .
as he was " posted " to the far east by his company , he had everything from his accommodation , work permits , and tax returns organised for him .
his company also paid for japanese lessons .
edward says it was a " fabulous experience " .
" it was the kind of experience i never could have had if i had stayed in the uk , " he says .
if you are not going through a secondment from your company , you will need to sort out any tax or pensions issues .
britain has reciprocal taxation agreements with many countries , which should ensure that you are not taxed twice on capital against tax and income .
the general rule is that if you spend more than 183 days a year in a foreign country , you are classed as a resident in that country and will be liable for tax there .
however , there are exceptions and it is important to find out what your liabilities are abroad and in the uk .
the inland revenue 's guide ir20 has more details on double taxation .
if you decide to work in europe , there is some useful tax and social security information on the dialogue website .
further sources : you might be able to claim benefits while you are abroad .
the department for work & pensions international division will tell you which benefits you can continue to claim -lrb- 0645 154811 -rrb- .
alternatively , try guidance note sa29 available from www.dss.gov.uk.
if you are contributing to a pension in the uk , you may be able to continue contributions for up to five years after you leave , but it depends on the type of plan you have .
if you have net relevant earnings in britain from a trade or profession in the uk you should be able to extend the contribution period indefinitely .

ms essex had said on wednesday she would consider requests not to allow the development at crymlyn burrows near swansea to go ahead .
sue essex had earlier refused to consider the calls the announcement was welcomed by stop the incinerator campaigners , who are opposed to the incinerator , which will handle waste from neath port talbot and bridgend .
but ms essex has now said she considered the request and ruled out revoking planning permission for the development .
the minister does not have the power to call in the project , but is able to recall planning permission .
she had previously declined requests to call in the incinerator , which the campaigners say poses a health risk .
licence protest the stop the incinerator group had staged a sit-in protest at the environment agency when the body ruled there was no reason not to grant a licence to the incinerator .
the group , which has vehemently opposed the development , was due to put chairman mike ryan forward for the swansea east welsh assembly by-election , which follows the death of val feld am in july .
but , after a meeting on monday evening , mr ryan stepped away from the race , announcing the campaign would not be fielding a candidate because it would distract them from their cause .
nominations for the by-election are due in on friday .
when a spokesperson for the environment minister said on wednesday she was considering a request to revoke planning permission , nicola roderick from the group welcomed the news .
we hope that she revokes it before the licence is granted and before the election actually goes ahead nicola roderick , campaigner " we 're absolutely delighted , " she said .
" she has had so much pressure from the general public in the area .
" because of the swansea east by-election , she has started to have pressure put on her by local politicians and by candidates for the by-election .
" we hope that she revokes it before the licence is granted and before the election actually goes ahead . "
but conservative am alun cairns accused ms essex of manufacturing a " political stunt " as the by-election draws near .
he said the minister had been " underhanded " and that the decision could have been taken months ago .
a report from the national society for clean air in june claimed modern incinerator plants posed only a negligible health risk .
but friends of the earth dismissed the report 's findings as badly researched .
greenpeace has also claimed incinerator emissions could contribute to cancers and heart disease .
the charity has called on the uk government to stop building the plants .

the ecb will make up its mind on thursday at lunchtime whether to drop its rate a further 0.25 % to 4.25 % .
it 's always a 50-50 call with the ecb ...
but there 's enough information for them to be able to justify a cut marc hendriks chief economist , sg securities since the last cut in may - the only one this year , compared with seven by the us federal reserve and four by the bank of england - indications of an economic slowdown in europe have multiplied , with germany especially badly affected .
but although inflation is now falling , with the latest figures showing an average rise in consumer prices of 2.8 % in the year to july across the eurozone , it is still higher than the bank 's " reference value " of 2 % or lower .
another factor in their decision this time is that it corresonds to the of launch of a campaign to inform the public about the euro - with just four months to go before the new currency becomes legal tender .
some observers believe that a rate cut would boost consumer confidence in the euro , while others argue that the bank would not want to distract attention from its high-profile campaign .
cautious noises the ecb is still trying to moderate market excitement about a possible rate cut .
in a speech delivered on 29 august , horst welteke , president of germany 's bundesbank and a member of the ecb 's council , acknowledged the high levels of uncertainty about the prospects for global economic growth .
but he stressed that the bank 's priority was controlling inflation rather than boosting growth .
welteke : ecb has " no mandate for growth " " the ecb council does not have the mandate to steer growth but to keep the value of money stable , " he told .
" the ability to fine-tune growth is clearly over-estimated , the lags with which monetary and fiscal impulses work , underestimated . "
inflation remains paramount and some observers say that the ecb 's more conservative approach is the right one .
the situations in europe and the us - the latter slowing sharply , the former as yet showing little diminution of inflation pressures - are different enough to justify the divergent strategies , according to the centre for economic policy research in its latest update , " monitoring the ecb " .
the ecb has a mandate of price stability and must therefore remain cautious when considering further interest rate cuts , " said the cepr 's professor francesco giavazzi .
" the worsening of gdp growth prospects in the euro area should not be a good enough reason for the ecb to reduce rates unless those gloomy prospects are accompanied by an unambiguous , persistent decline in medium term inflation forecasts , a possibility that has yet to materialise . "
bank of america economist deborah reed said the following meeting at the end of september is the more likely forum for a cut .
" by then september inflation figures will be coming through - and probably falling back closer to 2 % , " she said .
stage set for lower rates but with the continuing signs of a europe-wide economic slowdown , analysts say a cut is justified .
marc hendriks , chief economist at sg securities in london , agreed .
" it 's always a 50-50 call with the ecb , " he told bbc news online , referring to the traditional opacity of the frankfurt-based bank 's decision-making .
" but there 's enough information -lrb- in the shape of slowing growth -rrb- for them to be able to justify a cut . "
that opacity means the last cut came as a shock to most observers , and recent events - including a 160-page book written by senior members of the bank - could mean it wants to be seen as less impenetrable in the future .
a rate cut could enhance transparency at the ecb " if they do decide to cut , we will understand for the first time what they are doing , " mr hendriks said .
" if they do n't , i think a lot of people will raise expectations that cuts are off the agenda for some time . "
one reason why a cut might throw ecb strategy into sharp relief is the release of figures for the money supply .
m3 , as it is known , grew 6.4 % in july , faster than expected .
but the ecb was at pains to point to distortions caused by investors fleeing falling stock markets and heading for low-risk short-term debt and currency-based securities .
a cut would suggest that the ecb is taking the slowdown more seriously and not simply relying on the m3 and inflation metrics , the " two pillars " of its strategy .
the cepr report , indeed , says m3 has quietly been pushed aside , and advises the bank to come clean about it .
inflation fears but if the ecb decides to hold rates where they are , it could easily find the figures to support its position .
" firstly , inflation is still well above the target of 2 % , " mr hendriks said .
" secondly , there 's been some pretty encouraging data -lsb- such as positive german industrial confidence figures -rsb- suggesting the worst may be over . "
the rallying euro could help support a rate freeze as well , he said - although investors have bought the european single currency on worries about the us economy , rather than confidence in europe 's performance .
" they could easily say that if they cut now , that would confuse things , " mr hendriks said .
" they could say they have stuck by the inflation and money supply data , and have never suggested they 'll depart from that .
