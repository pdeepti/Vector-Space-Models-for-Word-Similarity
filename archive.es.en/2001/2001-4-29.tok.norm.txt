the information gathered in sunday 's snapshot of the nation will be used to help the government decide how to spend public money .
the once-in-a-decade survey is at its most complex this year , with new elements that include a question about religious denomination .
census statistics 23 million households surveyed 30 million census forms printed 40-41 census questions 70,000 temporary census workers census will cost £ 255m hundreds of thousands of people have already called the national helpline number with queries about the survey .
and many have not yet received their forms .
however organisers say by the end of sunday the majority of people will have had their forms .
and there is an extra incentive for new parents to fill in the form as the organisers are giving out free babygrows to households where a baby is born on sunday .
this is to encourage the newborns ' inclusion on the form , as many are believed to have missed out in the last census .
john pullinger , of the office of national statistics , said that handling 28 million forms represented a huge operation he told the bbc that the initial findings of the census would be ready by the summer of 2002 with detailed reports published in 2003 .
" this will give all the richness of information that we need to plan services for where we put schools , hospitals and other services over the next ten years , " he said .
for those tempted to not fill in the form , there is a fine of up to £ 1,000 for failure to comply .
but the civil rights group , liberty , thinks people should not be penalised for not filling in their forms .
spokeswoman deborah clarke said some may not want to answer the question on ethnic origin if they feel under threat from racists .
" we would n't want to discourage people from filling it in as i do think there is a greater social purpose here , " she said .
however she added that if someone was fined for failing to fill the form in , they were welcome to contact liberty stating their reasons and it would consider if these were strong enough to support a human rights case .
for the first time the form can be posted back .
up to 70,000 people have helped organise the census , which will cost an estimated £ 255m .
there are 40 questions in the form in england but 41 in wales to include a survey of welsh language speakers .
the number for the national telephone helpline , which has been set up in 12 different languages , is 0845 301 2001 .

when asked by a newspaper whether bt should have bid for a licence to run third generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phones , sir christopher bland , appointed chairman on thursday said : " certainly not . "
bt spent £ 4bn on its 3g licence , part of an 18-month spending spree with left the firm with £ 30bn of borrowings , and stoked the investor criticism which led to the resignation of sir christopher 's predecessor , sir iain vallance .
but sir christopher , speaking in an interview with the independent on sunday , said that " hindsight is a wonderful thing " future shake-up ?
he also left a question mark over the future of sir peter bonfield , bt 's chief executive , who many city analysts believe should have quit as well , or instead of , sir iain vallance .
" -lsb- sir peter -rsb- and i have complementary skills , " sir christopher told the newspaper .
" i hope that we will work well together .
if we do n't , then neither of us knows the answer . "
according to the mail on sunday , bt has hired a team of recruitment consultants to seek a successor to sir peter .
the team was stood down when last week 's change in chairmanship was agreed , the paper said .
political skills commentators see one of sir christopher 's main roles at bt as in negotiating some kind of concessions from the uk government to offset the £ 4bn licence cost .
sir christopher 's political skills , refined during his spell as chairman of the bbc , are believed to have been key to the bt board supporting his appointment .
while ministers have refused to renegotiate the 3g licences awarded to bt and four other operators , the government is reported to be investigating alternative ways of lightening the firms ' financial burden .
these could include easing competition restrictions to allow operators greater ability to share networks , so reducing the costs of installing infrastructure .
european commissioners , fearful that europe will fall behind in the global technology race , has suggested state aid for the operators .

his ideas , contained in a draft policy document for the social democrat party conference in the autumn , were reported in the german news magazine der spiegel and have been confirmed by the spd .
the document signals chancellor schroeder 's wish to make european policy central to his re-election campaign in 2002 .
but it is bound to unsettle eurosceptics outside his own country .
the document calls for the european commission in brussels to be turned into a new government , while proposing that the council of ministers , which pulls together the leaders of the member states , should become a second chamber similar to germany 's bundesrat .
the european parliament would gain supervision of the european budget , including massive agricultural spending .
second term in the past , mr schroeder has allowed his foreign minister , joschka fischer , to appear as a european visionary and face the resulting criticism whilst he stood back , signalling his quiet approval .
now it appears he wants to take the issue centre-stage himself .
the draft drawn up by the chancellor and a senior working group still has to go before various party committees before being discussed at the autumn conference .
but it is a sign that mr schroeder wants to have a clear policy on the development of europe to take into a second term if he is re-elected .

rebel shareholders are set to vote against the appointment of non-executive directors in protest at plans to give chairman brian gilbertson a £ 6.5m cash and shares windfall , the independent on sunday said .
the package will be awarded following the completion of billiton 's £ 20bn merger with australian rival bhp to create the world 's second largest mining and metals company .
while the deal is not reported to have caused significant disquiet among billiton shareholders , many investors are angry they have been denied a vote on the firm 's executive pay guidelines , the newspaper said .
" there is a lot of concern about the pay package offered to gilbertson and the way billiton has steadfastly refused to allow shareholders a say on the package , " a fund manager told the paper .
mounting concern the warning follows mounting concern among investors over awards to heads of firms such as vodafone , united business media and marks & spencer .
criticism has centred not so much on the level of awards , which many shareholders feel are necessary to ensure top quality management in uk firms , but on their payout clauses .
the decision last year by vodafone to give chief executive chris gent a £ 10m cash and share bonus for pulling of the takeover of mannesmann was attacked for coming too soon for the deal 's wisdom to be assessed .
similar criticisms dogged bonuses paid to royal bank of scotland chiefs a month after winning a takeover battle for natwest .
marks & spencer boss luc vandevelde last week waived a £ 816,000 bonus which he could , under contract clauses , have claimed for hitting restructuring targets .
m & s shareholders had questioned whether mr vandevelde should be eligible for such an award when he had failed to deliver improvements to the retailers ' trading performance .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- who rules europe 's net landscape ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo sunday , 29 april , 2001 , 10:57 gmt 11:57 uk who rules europe 's net landscape ? by bbc news online 's briony hale european internet service providers are merging , as advertising revenues continue to fall short of expectations .
a handful of isps now dominate the european internet landscape .
the consolidation is by no means over , but once these giants have paused for breath , there could be changes in store for their customers .
many experts agree that isps are soon going to have to develop a whole new relationship with their customers .
and that relationship is going to involve bigger bills .
the biggest are the best ... there is no other way jeffrey young allegra strategies analysts at three leading internet research firms all agree that the time for isps to start charging fees is approaching fast .
this would involve a fundamental shift away from enticing new customers through bargain offers , focusing instead on ensuring increased revenue from existing customers .
preparing for change " european isps need to switch their customers to a paid-for model in order to get revenue and look to the future of a billing relationship , " said jupiter mmxi 's dan stevenson .
" we 're still in the -lsb- customer -rsb- gathering stage , " said director of allegra strategies jeffrey young , " but there will come a point when isps will have enough users to start charging . "
europe 's big five aol t-online wanadoo tiscali terra with big changes looming ahead , industry players have been battling to position themselves in order to ensure a greater share of the market .
there has been an extensive market-place shake-up , with a wave of takeovers creating a whole new landscape for the remaining isps .
the industry consolidation was also prompted because of the difficulties of making money from advertising .
now , there are far fewer isps but they have a far bigger reach .
going for growth this week saw italy 's tiscali scoop up the uk 's lineone , it 's fourth acquisition since december .
now tiscali itself is rumoured to be a takeover target of its key competitor aol .
the number of independent isps is set to decline sharply tiscali has said that it wants to be in the top three in each of the european markets - quite some expansion programme for a small internet provider that began life in sardinia .
aol has also been on the warpath in europe , trying to spread its dominance in the us to the other side of the atlantic .
it has won itself more than 2 million customers in germany , is growing very fast in france and is in the top three of the uk , following what allegra strategies ' director jeffrey young calls a " staggering marketing campaign " .
the web - a free commodity a tie-up between these two giants could outsize the super-isp formed last december by the takeover of the uk 's freeserve by france 's wanadoo .
but working out which isp is winning the popularity stakes is tough because of the different methods of counting used by different isps .
money - or the need to try and make some - is driving the rapid consolidation .
we 'll keep buying to consolidate our position as european leader renato soru chief of tiscali isps are threatened with sharply lower advertising revenues and a customer base that has been weaned onto the internet through the idea that it is a free service .
in this highly competitive environment , taking advantage of the economy of scale is key to survival .
operators are moving strategically to ensure a strong geographical presence across europe in order to build scale .
" we 'll keep buying to consolidate our position as european leader , " said tiscali 's chief , renato soru .
down to five this process has led to just five main isps in europe , according to jupiter mmxi 's dan stevenson .
and these five are either connected to telecoms firms such as t-online and wanadoo , or have very well-known portals such as spain 's terra .
further acquisitions are unlikely amongst the big five - apart from the talk of aol and tiscali - but medium sized isps are attractive targets , says mr stevenson .
the smaller ones will either be shut down or target a particular niche market .
forrester research predicts that by 2005 , independent isps - such as the former virgin isp or world online - will account for just 5 % of the market compared to 27 % last year .
