security forces found the headless corpses floating in a river in the northern province of cordoba .
farc founder manuel marulanda can now boast 22,000 fighters the bodies are believed to be those of farmers kidnapped from the village of tierralta over a week ago .
local sources are saying the murders were carried out by the country 's largest marxist guerrilla army - the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , or farc .
sympathisers killed the kidnapping , interrogation , torture and execution of civilians is usually the style of colombia 's right-wing death squads from the united self-defence forces of colombia , the auc .
they have killed over 500 unarmed people so far this year .
their tactic of terror and killing suspected guerrilla sympathisers has had success undermining rebel support in many areas of the country , particularly their stronghold of this northern province of cordoba .
it has had so much success that there is fear that this latest massacre shows the guerrillas may be adopting their tactics .
violent phase colombia 's 37-year civil conflict is entering its most brutal and violent phase .
the country 's 22,000 marxist rebels are pitted against 8,000 right-wing paramilitaries , with the state more often than not just an observer .
between the two illegal armies of the left and right they control over half of colombia and , led by the paramilitaries , have increasingly targeted the other side 's civilian support base .
if this latest massacre is found to be the work of the farc , and they are adopting auc murder tactics , analysts here expect yet more civilians to turn up dead , and all too often mutilated .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- alcatel-lucent deal nears completion low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo tuesday , 29 may , 2001 , 05:49 gmt 06:49 uk alcatel-lucent deal nears completion an alcatel-lucent deal could take a year to gain clearance french telecom equipment maker alcatel is close to finalising a $ 32bn take-over of struggling us rival lucent .
" alcatel has made no secret of the fact that they want to become a powerful player in the us telecom marketplace jeffrey kagan , telecom analyst the deal would be the biggest ever european acquisition of a us technology company .
it would create a giant telecom group capable of taking on us company cisco and canadian group nortel .
alcatel and lucent held negotiations throughout the holiday weekend and worked to settle final details , sources said .
the companies ' boards are expected to vote on the deal on tuesday , according to sources .
' clean slate ' assuming final negotiations proceed successfully , the deal would likely be announced on wednesday - midday in paris and before markets open in the united states .
the structure and timing of a deal still may change , sources cautioned .
alcatel chief executive serge tchuruk would lead the combined company , while lucent chairman henry schacht would assume a lower but still senior position , a source said .
the deal will be characterised as a so-called " merger of equals " , but sources said alcatel clearly will be buying lucent , which posted $ 4.7bn in losses in the first half of its current fiscal year .
lucent , which carries a massive debt burden , has fallen behind nortel and cisco , due to management changes and product development problems .
telecom analyst jeffrey kagan said : " it gives lucent a clean slate to start over , and it gives alcatel a big foot in the door in the us marketplace .
" alcatel has made no secret of the fact that they want to become a powerful player in the us telecom marketplace .
" they have launched an aggressive advertising campaign to increase their awareness in the u.s. marketplace and have very aggressive plans . "
job cuts the combined company is expected to be legally incorporated in paris , but headquartered in lucent 's home of murray hill , new jersey , sources said .
lucent will have a say in the appointment of board members .
the combined company may get a new name , rather than taking either the alcatel or lucent brand names , sources said .
although analysts expect the combined company to cut as many as 20,000 jobs as part of their efforts to slash $ 4 billion a year in operating costs , one source said no job cuts would be announced wednesday .
a deal would face scrutiny from regulators in washington , who would examine anti-trust issues .
winning approval for the deal could take more than a year .
alcatel could also be prevented from taking over lucent 's bell labs , which does projects for the us government , which could be vital to us national security .
combining the french and us company also could be fraught with culture clashes and power struggles , analysts have said .

his son said he passed away at his home in stamford , connecticut , on sunday .
he was 74 and had been suffering from a heart condition .
a truly remarkable entrepreneur of the old kind - the kind they simply do n't make any more business associate jonathan lyons mr kiam made his fortune from remington electric razors when he fronted television advertisements for the product giving them his own endorsement .
the ads , which spread from the us to britain , made the firm and victor kiam a household name .
he also became a majority owner of the new england patriots nfl side in 1988 and remained at the helm for four years .
described as an astute businessman , mr kiam semi-retired in 1992 , ending the series of remington commercials as a multi-millionaire .
' what i like best ' but he remained chairman of remington 's board of directors until his death .
he also continued to do what he liked best - selling .
he went on to become chairman of the british cigarette lighter company - ronson plc - and ran a firm that marketed a line of travel-related products called travelsmart .
kiam said what he liked best was bringing new products to market and developing companies .
he made a difference in american business remington president neil defeo " i get more pleasure out of this than in running a $ 1 billion company that goes to $ 1.2 billion , " he said .
current remington president neil defeo said : " he was a wonderful man and he 'll be missed by many people .
and he made a difference in american business . "

hundreds of police were deployed on the streets of the town in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the weekend 's disturbances .
in one incident , officers confronted a gang of 40 white youths chanting racist slogans who were trying to make their way into an asian area .
bricks and dustbins were thrown at officers .
violence was most severe on saturday two pubs in the town centre were damaged and a number of cars and other property were vandalised , according to a spokeswoman for greater manchester police .
a petrol bomb was also thrown through the window of a car showroom and a car was damaged .
two people staying inside the showroom because of the previous nights ' trouble , were not injured .
eighteen white youths were arrested and held on suspicion of public order offences , affray and possession of an offensive weapon .
three asian youths were also arrested .
police said their response had been " appropriate " and the main problems during the night had been vandalism rather than violence .
no injuries there were no reports of injuries to members of the public or police officers compared to saturday night which left 15 officers and 10 civilians injured .
earlier , police laid much of the blame for the violence on far-right groups , saying they had exploited tensions between the town 's whites and asians .
in an apparent change of police tactics on monday , officers were stationed in a series of discrete holding areas , responding to isolated flarings of violence .
a number of asian youths gathered around shops in the glodwick area but stayed away from troublespots .
some asians had criticised an " excessive " police presence on sunday - which they said had helped provoke further violence .
greater manchester police assistant chief constable alan bridge said part of the problem had been " brought about by the intervention of outside elements " operating under the guise of " raising political awareness " .
' sheer carnage ' sunday night saw several flashpoints across the town , with petrol bombs thrown and buildings attacked .
an asian supermarket was set on fire , the offices of a local newspaper were firebombed , and barricades of furniture and tyres were set alight .
there were no reports of injuries but seven white youths and five asian youths were arrested .
a group of riot police narrowly escaped injury when a speeding car drove at their lines .
the seven officers dived for cover as the car sped off .
on saturday up to 500 asian youths battled against lines of riot police .
greater manchester police called it " sheer carnage " .
mr bridge denied there had been heavy-handedness or over-reaction on the part of police officers , and appealed for calm and a return to normality after " totally unacceptable disorder " .
prime minister tony blair backed the local police and insisted that the oldham riots were not typical of the state of british race relations .
he said : " i think the vast majority of people want to live together in peace and harmony with one another . "
newspaper attacked chief superintendent eric hewitt said oldham had a large asian population but conceded that the town had the worst record for racial incidents in the force area .
he said that over the last year a majority of violent racial incidents had involved white victims .
but he added : " there is no doubt that the presence of the national front and british national party in recent weeks would seem to be a deliberate ploy to exploit our racial situation and it has struck a chord of fear among all our communities , not just asians . "
richard knowles , liberal democrat leader of oldham council , criticised the national front and british national party , which despite being legal parties were " vile racists " .
the offices of the oldham evening chronicle in union street were damaged by a firebomb during sunday 's disturbances .
philip hirst , the paper 's managing director , told bbc radio 5live that allegations of bias were " complete rubbish " .
mr hirst said : " anybody who started life working on a local paper knows we get attacked on all sides , but it 's a hell of a way to make a complaint , chucking a firebomb through a window . "
in early may mr straw banned political marches in the town , in response to fears of growing racial tension .
meanwhile , oldham council is proceeding with the second day of a street performance festival called mayhem .
