a " blue box " of strict restrictions has been lifted on 1,561 farms around the thirsk area of north yorkshire .
and the so-called north england infected area restrictions have been lifted at 5,429 farms in cheshire , blackburn , darwen , bolton bury , salford , st helens , trafford , warrington and wigan .
disease in the uk total cases : 2,021 slaughtered : 3,870,000 awaiting slaughter : 6,000 awaiting disposal : 3,000 those areas have now been reclassified as " at risk " , rather than " high risk " - which means farmers will be allowed to move more livestock under the autumn movement restrictions .

in the mountains and rolling hills of rural pennsylvania , they somehow felt isolated and insulated from the violence and crime that they saw in the big cities and outside the us .
all that changed last week when one of the four planes hijacked by terrorists ploughed into a field just outside the town of shanksville .
but while their sense of security has been shaken , their sense of community has been strengthened .
it can happen here when andy demidont watched the planes slam into the world trade center towers , the local school superintendent thought : " i 'm glad we live in somerset , that ca n't happen here " .
but soon after the unthinkable did happen - just a half hour from his community of rockwood - when flight 93 blasted a 10-foot deep trench in the pennsylvania countryside .
the sentiment was echoed by 14-year-old michael .
" of all the millions and millions of places in the world , it was somerset county , the place that i thought was the safest place in the world , my cosy corner of the world , " he said .
like millions all across the us , he lit a candle last friday and took part in the national day of mourning , but it was not as much as he would have liked to have done .
" i felt kind of helpless that i was not able to take part in the rescue effort , " he said .
but as sad and tragic as the terrorists ' attacks have been , he does believe that it has brought people together .
" it 's just too bad it takes something like this , " he said .
the students have sent letters to the families of the victims , collected food to send to new york and held a memorial service .
families mourn memorial services were held on monday for families of the victims .
state troopers saluted them as they rode to the crash site .
i ca n't think of any other community in this whole world that i 'd sooner live in , these people just banded together local resident terry schaffer once there , they wept and left mementos at a memorial including photos , a teddy bear and a flight attendant 's jacket , according to salvation army officials present .
state police kept the media well away from the mourners .
after visiting the crash site , some 240 relatives of the victims attended a memorial service where first lady laura bush and pennsylvania governor tom ridge spoke .
" you are not alone , " mrs bush told the grieving relatives , adding : " all of us , as americans , share in this grief . "
best place in the world terry schaffer lives only a few miles from the crash site , and he was on the scene soon after the crash .
the chief of shanksville pennsylvania 's volunteer fire department arrived to find a plane that was " blown to bits " .
" there was n't a piece larger than a car hood , " he said .
but the tragedy has given him a new appreciation of the community of 245 people .
" i ca n't think of any other community in this whole world that i 'd sooner live in .
these people just banded together , " he said .
over the last several days , the residents of the town have erected a memorial to the victims of the crash and to the passengers that local residents believe sacrificed their own lives so that thousands of others could be saved .
based on phone calls made just before the plane went down , people in the area believe that a handful of passengers , knowing that they were already going to die , attempted to retake the plane from the hijackers .
signs all over the area pay tribute to the heroes of flight 93 .
betty and wallace ullery drove from cumberland , maryland , some 50 miles away to place a basket of flowers at the memorial at shanksville .
wallace ullery believes that the hijackers intended to hit either the presidential retreat of camp david or another target in washington such as the white house or the capitol .
but betty ullery said : " we believe whoever was on that plane knew the area and knew that they would be sparing a lot of lives by crashing in an unpopulated area . "

" significant progress has been made and we 're very optimistic that the memorandum of understanding can be signed in the near future " , said rob leggat , gm director of corporate communications for asia .
local press reports that a deal would be signed this week were " speculative " , he said .
the striken car firm said on tuesday it has been forced to close two out of its three korean plants because components makers are refusing to supply parts until they are paid .
parts dispute daewoo motors disputes subcontractors ' demands for 852bn won -lrb- $ 655m -rrb- , saying the court receiver has already settled its obligations .
we have made a significant progress in the talks .
gm remains positive about the deal gm spokesman the car firm was declared bankrupt in november 2000 and has been in talks with gm and its european partner fiat ever since .
daewoo motor spokeswoman park hae-yeung said around 20 subcontractors have halted supplies .
she declined to comment on how long closures at the kunsan and pupyong plants would last .
the pupyong plant has been a major sticking point to concluding a deal as gm views it as old and inefficient and has said it does not want to buy it .
the korean government and daewoo 's creditors are keen for pupyong to be included in the sale because it is daewoo motor 's biggest plant , employing about 7,000 workers .
gm gave no indication of whether it has changed its stance on pupyong .
gm korea spokesman kay lee said " some issues " have yet to be resolved .
" we have made a significant progress in the talks .

there has been a lot of concern over the rise of drug-resistant bacteria .
the really big resistance problem is in hospitals professor david livermore but professor david livermore , director of the antibiotic resistance monitoring and reference laboratory , london , uk , says new drugs do offer hope .
speaking at the public health laboratory service annual scientific conference in warwick on monday , he said it was important to keep ahead of the bacteria - which mutate to take account of new drugs developed to fight them .
it is in hospitals that the key fight to develop new antibiotics is being fought - and to some extent won .
' fatal infections ' at any one time , 9 % of patients in nhs hospitals are suffering from an infection acquired while on wards or in surgery , according to the national audit office .
it has estimated around 5,000 patients die every year , because of these infections , costing the nhs £ 1 billion annually .
urinary tract infections are particularly common , but surgical wounds , skin and the bloodstream can all be infected with potentially deadly bacteria .
scientists have to find antibiotics to treat two families of bacteria .
gram positive bacteria include methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus -lrb- mrsa -rrb- and vancomycin-resistant enterococci - two notorious superbugs .
in development drugs are available , or in development , which can treat these .
at the forefront are antibiotics called synercid and linezolid .
two more , daptomycin and oritacancin , are in development .
but the other " family " of bacteria - gram negative , particularly a type called pseudomonas , are proving harder to treat .
professor livermore told bbc news online : " we have got treatment options available for these particular , gram positive , forms of bacteria . "
but he said : " against gram negative , there are very few antibiotics . "
there have also been fears that too much of prescribing of antibiotics by gps has meant the drugs will be less effective for patients .
professor livermore said " less and better " prescribing of antibiotics would slow the development of resistance against the drugs .
but he said scientists had to keep " one step ahead " as bacteria became resistant to new antibiotics .
professor livermore added : " the really big resistance problem is in hospitals rather than in the community . "

the really big resistance problem is in hospitals professor david livermore but professor david livermore , director of the antibiotic resistance monitoring and reference laboratory , london , uk , says new drugs do offer hope .
speaking at the public health laboratory service annual scientific conference in warwick on monday , he said it was important to keep ahead of the bacteria - which mutate to take account of new drugs developed to fight them .
it is in hospitals that the key fight to develop new antibiotics is being fought - and to some extent won .
' fatal infections ' at any one time , 9 % of patients in nhs hospitals are suffering from an infection acquired while on wards or in surgery , according to the national audit office .
it has estimated around 5,000 patients die every year , because of these infections , costing the nhs £ 1 billion annually .
urinary tract infections are particularly common , but surgical wounds , skin and the bloodstream can all be infected with potentially deadly bacteria .
scientists have to find antibiotics to treat two families of bacteria .
gram positive bacteria include methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus -lrb- mrsa -rrb- and vancomycin-resistant enterococci - two notorious superbugs .
in development drugs are available , or in development , which can treat these .
at the forefront are antibiotics called synercid and linezolid .
two more , daptomycin and oritacancin , are in development .
but the other " family " of bacteria - gram negative , particularly a type called pseudomonas , are proving harder to treat .
professor livermore told bbc news online : " we have got treatment options available for these particular , gram positive , forms of bacteria . "
but he said : " against gram negative , there are very few antibiotics . "
there have also been fears that too much of prescribing of antibiotics by gps has meant the drugs will be less effective for patients .
professor livermore said " less and better " prescribing of antibiotics would slow the development of resistance against the drugs .
but he said scientists had to keep " one step ahead " as bacteria became resistant to new antibiotics .
professor livermore added : " the really big resistance problem is in hospitals rather than in the community . "
