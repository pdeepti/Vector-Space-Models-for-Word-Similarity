the practice , also known as female genital mutilation , is banned in the uk , but is traditional among many african communities , and medical experts believe gps will see more cases among certain asylum seeker groups .
the main communities who practise circumcision in the uk are eritreans , ethiopians , somalis and yemenis .
the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- is advising gps to be on the alert and to contact social services if they suspect parents are planning to take their daughters abroad to be circumcised .
the bma says if a family requests the procedure for their daughter , their gp should explain it is illegal and classified as child abuse in the uk .
female genital mutilation is a practice that causes girls and women serious health and psychological problems for life professor vivienne nathanson , bma the guidelines state : " if necessary doctors should seek the help of social services , counsellors and other health professionals when dealing with cases of female genital mutilation .
" where parents can not be persuaded that their daughter should not be subjected to female genital mutilation , doctors will have to find sensitive ways to explain that steps may be taken to prevent the child from being mutilated .
" if a doctor fears that a girl may be taken abroad for genital mutilation he / she may have to consider initiating child protection proceedings if there is no other feasible way of protecting the child . "
about 138 million women worldwide have undergone genital mutilation , according to the world health organisation .
reversal an all-party parliamentary group estimated that there are 3-4,000 new cases in the uk every year , but the true figure is believed to be higher .
the bma 's head of ethics professor vivienne nathanson said : " female genital mutilation is a practice that causes girls and women serious health and psychological problems for life .
" there is no doubt that parents agree to the practice with the best interests of their daughters at heart but doctors must work with families to show them that by agreeing to this procedure they are causing them untold harm and damage . "
genital mutilation involves procedures which include the partial or total removal of the external female genital organs .
it is carried out for many different reasons , from hygiene and aesthetics to protecting virginity , enhancing male sexual pleasure or discouraging promiscuity .
the procedure is usually performed on girls between the ages of four to 13 , but in some cases it is carried out on babies or young women prior to marriage or pregnancy .
nhs clinics perform genital mutilation reversals and doctors were urged to encourage mutilated women to have the operation before becoming pregnant .

from this week 150,000 people who work for the state of buenos aires wo n't get all of their salary paid in cash .
some of it will now be paid in one-year bonds , called " patacones " , nicknamed after a long defunct currency .
already mcdonalds in buenos aires is planning to accept the currency and is launching a special meal deal called the " patacombo " .
dire need of cash cash machines at the provincial bank in buenos aires are being loaded up with $ 90bn worth of the freshly minted patacones bills , named after a currency which was last around 120 years ago .
these will pay the wages of local state employees earning more than $ 740 a month .
this state , like many others , is in dire need of cash .
it has been hit by falling tax receipts , customers have been withdrawing their savings from the banks , and credit is drying up .
the central government has already agreed with the imf a " zero deficit " policy , which means it can only spend what it brings in in tax .
no public sector borrowing is allowed .
when the patacones come into circulation in a few days time they 'll be accepted by provincial and federal governments to settle tax obligations .
water and telephone utilities have also agreed to take them .
meal deal the fast food chain mcdonalds will also accept them in exchange for its new patacombo meal - two cheeseburgers , french fries and a drink .
while this latest mcdonalds range may have provoked amusement among emerging market traders - the advent of the bonds is causing alarm at home .
workers are already worried that the new bonds could be worthless .
in theory they 'll pay 7 % interest and be redeemable in a year .
in the past when hard-pressed governments have resorted to printing extra cash to pay their workers - it has resulted in hyperinflation .
argentina 's chronic inflation in the 1980 's was eventually overcome with the creation of the currency board in 1991 .
this meant that every peso was pegged to and backed by the us dollar .
but the introduction of this alternate means of payment raises questions about the future of the currency board .

in july of this year the figure stood at 3.864 million on a seasonally adjusted basis .

he said young people should be given training contracts , with a firm offer of work , but those who refused would lose the right to unemployment pay-outs .
the hostile reaction from the government 's trade union allies shows how politically contentious such reforms would be .
one trade union leader said the proposal would deprive the poorest of their basic subsistence .
trade unions argue the only way to reduce unemployment is to limit the number of overtime hours worked , forcing employers to hire more workers .

economists from the royal bank of scotland have published statistics which show that production fell below two million barrels a day during june .
the average value of output during this period was Â£ 39.23m a day - a drop of nearly Â£ 10m on the previous year .
britain 's oil production comes mainly from the north sea .
bank economists say a combination of factors - summer maintenance shutdown periods , uncertainty over oil prices and the legacy of a period of low investment in 1999 and 2000 - were responsible for the decrease .
in the period from may to june , the royal bank 's oil and gas production index fell from 131.8 to 121.1 .
average daily output figures show the may level of 2.17 million barrels a day tailing off to 1.993 million barrels a day in june .
the bank 's economists also said that the daily value of oil produced in june was Â£ 3.8m lower than may 's level .
however , gas production over the same period averaged Â£ 11.83m a day , and industry experts expect total production in 2001 to match last year 's historic peak .
the index figures showed that oil prices in june dropped in both dollar and sterling terms , and have weakened further since then to stand at about $ 25 a barrel .
the royal bank 's oil and gas economist tony wood said prices may fall even further in the near future .
" in the longer term , market demand is weakening , world supply is increasing , and opec continues to produce well beyond its quota levels , suggesting further downward pressure in prices over the coming months , " he said .
