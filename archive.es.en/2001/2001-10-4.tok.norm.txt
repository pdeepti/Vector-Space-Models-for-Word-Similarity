the president of the british veterinary association -lrb- bva -rrb- , david tyson , has made the claim ahead of his address to the organisation 's annual conference in winchester on thursday .
he says an urgent review of current import controls is needed to prevent terrorists using imported food to attack britain .
mr tyson says that if terrorists took advantage of what he considers weak import controls , then a human catastrophe could occur .
foot-and-mouth the association of port health authorities , which represents all major air and sea ports , has also warned the government in the past of serious deficiencies in procedures for preventing illegal meat entering the uk .
it is thought that foot-and-mouth disease may have entered the country in supplies of illegally imported meat .
a spokeswoman for the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said steps had been taken to control illegal imports and contingency plans were continually being updated .
mr tyson is speaking to the bva 's annual congress in winchester , hants , where most of his address is due to focus on foot-and-mouth .
he is expected to call for a national veterinary service to be set up in response to his dissatisfaction with the way government agencies have dealt with the outbreak .

statistics from the scottish further education funding council annual report also show that more than half of those enrolling were women .
they also show that nearly three in five -lrb- 58 % -rrb- of those joining courses were aged 25 and over .
the report concluded that the further education sector was on course to meet the scottish executive 's goal of 40,000 new student places by 2001-2002 .
the funding council 's chair , esther roberton , said : " the overall financial climate for further education remained favourable with the scottish executive again recognising , through increased funding , the major contribution colleges make to scotland 's economy and our wider society .
" we continued to work closely with the colleges to help them play their part in delivering the executive 's vision of a learning society .
" in turn , colleges were expected to deliver more learning , in more flexible ways , to more students , and to boost quality and the use of information technology . "
the report reveals that the majority of student enrolments -lrb- 88 % -rrb- were on vocational courses - a rise of 6 % on the previous year .
political debate the most popular further education courses in colleges were information technology -lrb- it -rrb- and basic access skills with business and management and it courses coming out top among higher education courses .
enrolments from the registered unemployed also rose by 3 % while those receiving bursary support in the first two terms of the academic year increased by 16 % .
the figures are likely to spark another round of political debate between the scottish executive and opposition parties .
we continued to work closely with the colleges to help them play their part in delivering the executive 's vision of a learning society esther roberton , shefc enterprise minister wendy alexander will argue that funding to scottish colleges rose by 16 % to £ 374m in the last academic year and underlines the executive 's commitment to widening access and developing a " knowledge economy " .
but opposition parties , spearheaded by the scottish national party , will point out that recent job losses in manufacturing and electronics are likely to severely limit the job opportunities open to college graduates .
there are also likely to be more calls from teaching unions for a rise in pay for lecturers .
they will argue that the executive should make more cash available for a similar pay deal to the one recently agreed with school teachers .

a statement issued by president abdelaziz bouteflika said that a constitutional amendment will be drawn up instituting the change .
such reforms had previously been strongly opposed by powerful circles in the majority arab community , in particular the military , as well as by the islamist movement .
a statement issued by president bouteflika said the government had agreed to the demands after serious unrest flared up following the killing of berber protestors by police last april .

that has always been regarded as an affront by the berbers , who claim to represent over a quarter of the population and say their culture and language are distinct .
the impetus for the change has been the recent berber unrest which has provoked a wave of ethnic sentiment that brought hundreds of thousands of berbers onto the streets , clearly startling the military-backed government .

he is telling them that the government will also agree to initiate legal proceedings against paramilitary police accused of shooting dead some 60 berber civilians during the recent clashes .

delegates from the two koreas are meeting in the north korean diamond mountain resort which first opened to south korean tourists three years ago .
the venture is still the only opportunity for most south koreans to visit the north as the two countries still remain technically at war .
the talks are the first in a series of exchanges between the two koreas this month , following last month 's ministerial meetings which ended a six-month boycott of official dialogue by the north .
heavy losses south korean officials will be asking north korea to open a road linking the two countries to help boost the landmark tourism project at diamond mountain , which is near the demilitarised zone separating the two countries .
until now the only way for tourists to get there has been by lengthy and costly cruise tours .
tourism has helped break down decades of mistrust but the south korean company which runs the tours , hyundai asan , scaled back the project this year because it was losing hundreds of millions of dollars .
the company had paid $ 12m a month to the north in return for exclusive rights to operate the project but it was forced to cut this back because of mounting losses and a drop in tourist numbers .
opening a land route across the two countries ' heavily fortified frontier , saving time and money , is expected to significantly boost the tourism venture .
south korean officials hope that an existing unpaved road linking the two countries could be opened by this year , with a wider expressway built next year .
the cruise tours to mount kumgang were seen as a breakthrough in relations between the two koreas , and the project has been a key source of income for the impoverished north .
south korean officials are hoping the north will also deliver on an earlier promise to designate the mountain area as a special tourist zone .
that would pave the way for investors to build facilities such as golf courses , ski resorts and other entertainment facilities which could help boost tourism in the communist country .

aircraft have been standing on the tarmac since tuesday , as the airline failed to find the cash to pay for fuel .

the bank 's monetary policy committee will at 1100 gmt on thursday reveal whether it will introduce a further cut in rates , already at their lowest level since 1964 .
with the global economy faltering in the aftermath of the terrorist strikes , the bank has in recent weeks come under pressure to match rate reductions implemented in other leading industrial states .
since the attacks , the mpc has introduced a cut of only quarter point , introduced one day later than reductions ordered by other major central banks .
the us central bank , the federal reserve , on tuesday implemented its second 0.5 percentage point rate cut since the atrocities , taking rates to 2.5 % .
complex picture mpc members , who began their deliberations on wednesday , are faced with a series of often contradictory reports on the health of the uk economy .
uk manufacturers are weathering recession , while the service sector is still relatively strong .
a survey published on wednesday , however , said that the uk service sector has contracted for the first time in two and half years .
a report from the halifax found that house prices stalled last month , in a slowdown set to last throughout the winter , a forecast which will reduce pressure on the mpc to maintain rates .
fears of a housing boom , and a rise in wages as employers struggled to fill vacancies in times of low unemployment , have been among the major factors which have dissuaded the bank from cutting rates further .
nonetheless , inflation is relatively high , rising 0.4 % to 2.6 % in august , above the bank 's 2.5 % target .
high inflation points towards interest rates rises .
two consumer confidence reports last week came to contradictory conclusions , with one finding sentiment had slumped to its lowest level since 1980 and the other that optimism had remained largely unaffected by the terrorist attacks .
political points ?
the interest rate picture has been further clouded by a report showing that , before the attacks , some mpc members had been keen to raise rates .
some city analysts have also speculated that the mpc might be tempted to score political points by maintaining rates , and reinforcing the uk 's independence from the us .
tom hougaard , analyst at city bookmakers financial spreads , said the mpc had been " quite obstinate " in the past .
" they do not want to be seen to be playing second fiddle to the fed , " he said .
but hopes of a cut helped support shares in early trade on thursday , with the ftse 100 index of leading stocks standing up 90 points at 4,972 shortly after 0730 gmt . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's brian milligan " not everyone benefits from lower rates " the bbc 's dharshini david " it is still too early to judge the economic impact of the terror attacks " how healthy is uk plc ?

kat slater disclosed on monday night 's episode of the bbc one soap that she was zoe slater 's mother - not her sister .
on tuesday night , kat revealed that zoe 's father was her uncle .
since the start of the storyline calls had soared by 60 % compared with this time last year , said the nspcc .
" by covering the subject in such a direct , sensitive way , eastenders is helping to raise public awareness and is adding to a wider atmosphere where people are more likely to report any issues relating to child protection , " said chief executive mary marsh .
the storyline in eastenders was introduced only after consultation with the nspcc and the samaritans .
the show 's executive producer john yorke told bbc breakfast : " whenever you embark on something you know is controversial , you have to be sure you are doing it responsibly and accurately as well .
strain " we would n't have gone on unless they were happy we were doing it right . "
he added that as well as working in-depth with the nspcc and the samaritans , they also consulted social workers and psychiatrists .
the audience for monday 's episode peaked at 13.9 million people , according to unofficial overnight ratings .
the viewing figures for the shock revelation of the identity of zoe 's father on tuesday reached 14.3 million .
wallace told bbc breakfast that the latest twist in the soap 's plot had been a strain for her .
" it was really hard , it was quite disturbing for me to do , " she said .
" but it was so well written - i just hope i 've done it justice . "
michelle ryan , who plays zoe , said that she felt the series had treated a difficult subject appropriately .
" it 's a very delicate and dramatic and serious storyline , that needs to be done with the utmost care - and i think it 's been dealt with that way . "
mr yorke denied any suggestion that the revelations were motivated by the search for higher ratings - and said that developing the soap 's characters led the storyline .
eastenders won eight awards at monday night 's inside soap awards in london - including one for jessie wallace as best newcomer .
