the bbc 's social affairs analyst roger wicks examines the issues .
the political battle for the family vote has officially kicked off .
february saw the conservatives make a pitch for the ' traditional ' family where married couples are supported .
labour hopes that its attempt to support all mothers , whether married or not , in the budget will go down well among a wider range of female voters .
the fight is an important one for both parties .
labour won the female vote for the first time in 1997 .
william hague is out to ensure that this was a one-vote wonder .
budgeting for children gordon brown 's budget promise of extra help for mothers was coupled with expected extra cash for the new children 's tax credit .
unlike the conservatives , there is no emphasis on marriage .
help goes to all mothers , whether they are married , co-habiting or single .
compare and contrast the flagship working families ' tax credit , which goes to low-paid workers with children , will rise by £ 5 a week from june .
the child allowance in income support , which supports the poorest families , will rise by £ 1.50 .
the signals could not be clearer .
again the emphasis is on attempting to ' make work pay ' .
the new children 's tax credit -lrb- ctc -rrb- , which starts in april , was raised before it was even up and running - from £ 8.50 to £ 10 a week .
the ctc is targeted at low and middle income families but does not help poor families who pay no tax .
gordon brown announced that in 2002 , mothers will receive a " baby credit " of £ 20 per week , in the year of their child 's birth .
maternity leave will be extended from 18 to 26 weeks and maternity pay will rise from £ 60.20 a week to £ 75 next year , and to £ 100 in 2003 .
but the much anticipated promise of paid ' paternity ' leave - two weeks - will not come into effect until 2003 .
why tax credits ?
the working families ' tax credit -lrb- wftc -rrb- goes to families where one adult is in work .
it is the government 's attempt to overcome the ' unemployment trap ' in which the jobless decline work because it would leave them little better off than benefits .
it is unclear whether the strategy has been successful .
jobless figures have fallen , but they may have done so anyway due to generally improved economic conditions .
critics , from the conservatives to prominent labour backbenchers like frank field , argue that new labour 's love of tax credits only extends the means-test .
tax payers as well as people on benefits are now means-tested .
conservatives william hague would bring back a version of the married couples ' allowance which helps those with children under 11 .
it was expected that the tories would commit themselves to a full restoration of the married couples ' allowance -lrb- mca -rrb- , abolished by labour one year ago .
the mca was an incentive in the tax system to get married - you paid less tax in wedlock than out .
it had nothing to do with children .
in contrast labour has said very little on marriage - its policies are designed to help all children , poorer children in particular .
so when a greatly modified version of the mca was revealed commentators were quick to cry ' u-turn ' .
the allowance would be directly linked to children , aiming to support both children under 11 and women who wish to stay at home .
indeed , entitlement depends on ' the carer ' -lrb- normally the woman -rrb- staying at home .
her unused personal allowance -lrb- the first £ 4000 tax-free earnings -rrb- is transferred to the husband , doubling his allowance .
the policy does not help poor families who are out of work , because they do not pay tax .
tax credit confusion eyebrows have been raised at the children 's tax credit 's qualification rules .
people who pay the higher rate of taxation -lrb- those earning £ 34,000 a year -rrb- begin to see the credit withdrawn - at £ 40,000 they will receive nothing .
but if each parent earns £ 32,000 -lrb- just below the higher rate threshold -rrb- they receive the full ctc , despite having a combined income of £ 64,000 .
this seems quite an obvious anomaly - how has it come about ?
the issue is which ' taxation unit ' is used , the individual or the family .
in recent years individual taxation has prevailed .
however , the benefits system normally works on the basis of the family .
income support is calculated on the basis of whether the claimant is single , married and a parent .
likewise , the working families ' tax credit .
what are tax credits ?
tax credits are one of labour 's key social policy innovations , though they were conceived in the united states .
the idea is to use the tax system in the same way as the benefits system .
the novel aspect is that the tax system can be used to give people as well as take it away .
traditionally , the tax system takes money away for various purposes such as maintaining services .
social security benefits are used to provide people with sums of money to meet various needs .
these include unemployment , retirement , disability and meeting the extra costs of bringing up children .
could these needs be met more effectively through the tax system ?
the government appears to think so .
gordon brown describes this as the ' integration ' of the tax and benefits system .

mr bush said any deal on limiting north korea 's missile programme would include verifiable terms that would prevent cheating .
i do have some scepticism about the leader of north korea president bush he expressed doubt that such a secretive nation as north korea could be trusted to abide by an agreement .
mr bush 's comments followed a meeting with the south korean president , kim dae-jung , who favours a policy of engagement with north korea .
both leaders described their talks at the white house as frank .
scepticism ' ' we do look forward to - at some point in the future - having a dialogue with the north koreans , " mr bush said .
' ' but any negotiation would require complete verification . "
he said he was not sure north korean leader , kim jong-il , was abiding by the terms of its existing international agreements .
' ' i do have some scepticism about the leader of north korea , " he said .
the clinton administration came close to persuading north korea to abandon its missile programme in return for a substantial aid package .
washington has pointed to the north 's arsenal to justify pushing ahead with its controversial national missile defence -lrb- nmd -rrb- programme .
reconciliation efforts earlier , secretary of state colin powell said us relations would not resume at the point reached after former secretary of state madeleine albright 's visit to pyongyang last october .
but he added : " some promising elements were left on the table and we will be examining those elements . "
mr kim , who won the nobel peace prize last year for his reconciliation efforts with the north , also met members of the bush administration and members of congress .
south korea had hoped the talks would strengthen bilateral ties and result in support from the new us administration for seoul 's rapprochement policy towards pyongyang .
the bbc 's richard lister in washington says the tougher tone from the white house is unlikely to be welcomed by the south korean leader , who is trying to reduce tension through increased contacts with the north .
staunch ally north korea last weekend signalled its impatience with the slow process of the bush administration 's policy review .
government officials in pyongyang repeated a warning that they might scrap a moratorium on long-range missile tests and revive a nuclear programme that washington fears was being used to develop nuclear weapons .
the us , with 37,000 troops stationed in the south to counter any threat from the north , has been a staunch ally of seoul .
but while president kim 's ' ' sunshine policy " , aimed at constructively engaging the north , was strongly supported by president clinton the current administration has so far been cautious in spelling out its policy towards pyongyang .

prime minister ali khalif gallaydh accused ethiopia 's government of intervening in somalia 's internal affairs and said ethiopia should stop trying to undermine the somali government .
ethiopia can not be the architect of how somalia should reconcile prime minister ali khalif gallaydh several warlords and faction leaders are seeking some form of united opposition to the first government in somalia for 10 years , which was set up at talks in djibouti last year .
leaders recently arrived include the head of the autonomous region of puntland , abdullahi yusuf ahmed , and general mohamed hersi morgan as well as general adam abdullahi gabyo and general hassan mohamed nur .
they are meeting other faction leaders from mogadishu including hussein aideed , osman hassan atto and musse sudi yalahow who announced last week that they had resolved their differences .
' sabotage ' in a press conference at the government 's headquarters at the ramadan hotel in the capital mogadishu , mr gallaydh said ethiopia was trying to divide somalia into several , small fiefdoms ruled by warlords , " ethiopia can not be the architect of how somalia should reconcile , " said mr gallaydh " the confidence and will of our people is much stronger than ethiopian plots to sabotage the new government , " he said .
mr gallaydh said his government was " 100 % ready " to talk to the ethiopian government to try to resolve their differences .
president abdulkassim salat hassan 's government has had trouble imposing his new administration 's authority - despite strong shows of support among the smali civilians .
on wednesday in northern mogadishu at least three people died and seven were wounded when two rival militias clashed .

the 10 survivors , including one man who spent more than 12 hours adrift in the atlantic , left the western isles on wednesday to fly to london and then onto spain .
however , their return was tinged with sadness for the six men who died after the german-registered hansa sank 240 miles west of tiree , in the western isles , on monday night .
the men 's bodies were taken to killybegs , in the irish republic , on wednesday on board two norwegian vessels which helped the rescue bids .
nine fishermen were winched from a life raft the dead were pulled from the sea on tuesday , the first body being found less than an hour after the miraculous rescue of juan caamano .
he was plucked from the icy water after spending more than 12 hours being battered by high winds and 20ft waves .
the fisherman was kept in hospital overnight with hypothermia , but released in time to fly home with his colleagues .
the survival of the 36-year-old was described as " exceptional " by rescuers .
raf spokesman michael mulford said : " he really must have the survival instinct - this is quite exceptional in the history of search and rescue operations . "
meanwhile , the ship 's owners , spanish-based hansa fish , were set to investigate the cause of the tragedy .
a spokesman for the maritime and coastguard agency said : " as the incident happened in international waters and no british nationals were on board , then the investigation is the responsibility of the owners . "
a spokesman for stornoway shipping services , the sunken vessel 's agents , declined to comment on the incident .

the warning comes from japanese geologists studying land movement in the area .
machu picchu was used by the incas as a refuge from the spanish empire in the 16th century .
it was rediscovered by explorers in 1911 and declared a unesco world heritage site in 1983 .
it is perhaps the most important place in peru , the country 's main tourist attraction and a symbol of intense national pride .
danger of collapse now , geologists from the disaster prevention research institute at kyoto university have warned that the site may be in danger of collapsing .
the geologists have measured movement on the steep back slope of the fortress .
they have found that the land is sliding down at a rate of about one centimetre -lrb- 0.4 inches -rrb- a month .
scientists say this is quite fast and is a precursor to a major landslide .
but they say they can not predict when this might happen and will try to determine that during the next stage of their research .
claim denied however , a peruvian preservation official has firmly denied that landslides pose an immediate threat .
the director of the national institute of culture in cuzco , javier lambarri , said the ruins are monitored for seismic activity 24 hours a day .
" as of now , we have no report that there is an imminent danger , " he said .
however , mr lambarri did admit that there was a geological fault line in the region that could cause difficulties .
" we know that there is a fault line that crosses the entire city and that could cause a problem , " he said .
preservation debate already , a debate exists over how best to preserve machu picchu for future generations .
last year , the authorities decided to limit the number of visitors to the site because of fears of erosion .
but the measure has not satisfied conservationists .
they have warned that more needs to be done and they have campaigned against plans to build a cable car up to the fortress .
one peruvian presidential candidate has promised that if he wins next month 's election , he will stage his inauguration at machu picchu .
now , perhaps , his plans may have to be revised .

why ?
the money programme reveals that the internet share bubble was pumped up by the very people supposed to provide investors with impartial advice , exposing a flaw at the very heart of our financial system .
exactly one year ago dotcom fever was raging on both sides of the atlantic .
new internet-based companies , with little business and no profits , were valued at billions of pounds on the world 's stock markets .
suddenly the fever evaporated along with the value of dotcom shares , leaving millions of investors poorer and threatening the health of the global economy .
small investors , who were caught up in the boom , now feel deeply disillusioned .
one of them was donald demar , a 71 year old retired grocery shop owner .
he invested over two hundred thousand pounds in a dotcom company to help provide an inheritance for his grandchildren .
now that investment is worth fifteen thousand pounds and donald is angry .
" i feel " he says , " as if i was walking down the street and someone stole my wallet " at the height of the boom new internet share issues were being launched almost every day , generating billions of pounds in fees for investment banks and brokers .
at the same time , some ' analysts ' employed by the same banks and brokers - supposedly to give unbiased advice to investors on what to buy and sell - kept advising investors to buy , buy and keep on buying .
tom brown spent twenty years working on wall street as a share analyst , paid well over a million dollars a year .
he believes that there is now a deep - and damaging - conflict of interest at the heart of some of the world 's most powerful financial institutions .
the leading banks earn huge fees from companies for launching new share issues and advising on mergers and acquisitions .
and analysts who do n't recommend the shares they follow risk losing business for their banks .
this conflict of interest played a major role in pumping up the share bubble to absurd heights .
" it was wall street at it worst " according to tom brown .
nils blythe talks to amazon boss jeff bezos , bankers , brokers and investors to uncover the causes of the dotcom share bubble , why it burst and the real winners and losers of " the great dot con " .

clubbing in britain is very big business indeed but for the elite - the so-called " superclubs " - filling the dancefloor has become far less important than developing an international brand .
indeed only a tiny percentage of a superclub 's turnover actually comes from punters going into clubs .
the industry as a whole is worth an estimated 2 billion pounds and rising to the uk economy .
in fact uk clubland plc has become a major exporter .
all around the world and in particular in the united states and the far east , the british clubbing scene is seen as the next big thing - with a far greater impact than any hype surrounding cool britannia a few years ago .
superstar djs -who now appear in lists for the biggest earners and most influential people in britain - are becoming global celebrities .
pete tong 's " essential mix " -lrb- made for radio one -rrb- is america 's most listened to dance radio show for instance and many british djs are in huge demand from australia to moscow .
meanwhile superclubs like ministry , cream and renaissance are now not only established players in the record business and media in the uk but are also setting up empires -lrb- with overseas record labels and satellite clubs -rrb- around the world .
it 's a long way from ravers in muddy fields and illegal warehouse parties just fifteen short years ago .
a revealing new bbc documentary from the business programmes unit - reported by rajan datar - examines how far down the road towards commercialisation and globalisation the uk 's clubbing industry has gone .
superclubs are agreeing lucrative sponsorship with drinks and cigarette companies , selling their own package holidays to ibiza and designing clothes .
multi-national companies like eriksson and unilever are also tapping the massive captive 18-30 audience - a highly desirable market with above average disposable income to burn .
43 % of 18-24 year olds will go clubbing this month .
with exclusive access to superclubs like renaissance from nottingham the programme asks how far can promoters go without losing credibility with their crucial core audience ?
the d ocumentary looks at the rise and rise of the superstar dj .
turntable heroes like pete tong and dave seaman are the new rockstars and significantly more turntables are being sold than guitars on the high street .
but djs are charging higher and higher prices -lrb- tens of thousands of pounds for three hour sets in some cases -rrb- and threatening to outprice the clubbing establishment .
it also looks at further threats to the superclubs from the booming underground club movement -lrb- who believe the big boys have sold out -rrb- and from the mass market nightclub conglomerates like the first leisure who are trying to shake off their naff " roxy " image .
we go to new york and witness how huge the british clubbing scene is amongst america 's suburban youth where all the talk is about the " new british invasion " .
we go to the city 's famous twilo club where british dj 's are regarded as gods and pack out the venue .
and follow geoff oakes of renaissance around new york as he sets up record and touring deals with american companies .
but ultimately , the programme asks , how long will this phenomenon last ?
can club culture avoid the fate of every other youth movement and manage to remain prominent in the lifestyles of young people ?
is the drive toward business expansion at the cost of credibility and will this lead to its eventual downfall ?

why ?
the money programme reveals that the internet share bubble was pumped up by the very people supposed to provide investors with impartial advice , exposing a flaw at the very heart of our financial system .
exactly one year ago dotcom fever was raging on both sides of the atlantic .
new internet-based companies , with little business and no profits , were valued at billions of pounds on the world 's stock markets .
suddenly the fever evaporated along with the value of dotcom shares , leaving millions of investors poorer and threatening the health of the global economy .
small investors , who were caught up in the boom , now feel deeply disillusioned .
one of them was donald demar , a 71 year old retired grocery shop owner .
he invested over two hundred thousand pounds in a dotcom company to help provide an inheritance for his grandchildren .
now that investment is worth fifteen thousand pounds and donald is angry .
" i feel " he says , " as if i was walking down the street and someone stole my wallet " at the height of the boom new internet share issues were being launched almost every day , generating billions of pounds in fees for investment banks and brokers .
at the same time , some ' analysts ' employed by the same banks and brokers - supposedly to give unbiased advice to investors on what to buy and sell - kept advising investors to buy , buy and keep on buying .
tom brown spent twenty years working on wall street as a share analyst , paid well over a million dollars a year .
he believes that there is now a deep - and damaging - conflict of interest at the heart of some of the world 's most powerful financial institutions .
the leading banks earn huge fees from companies for launching new share issues and advising on mergers and acquisitions .
and analysts who do n't recommend the shares they follow risk losing business for their banks .
this conflict of interest played a major role in pumping up the share bubble to absurd heights .
" it was wall street at it worst " according to tom brown .
nils blythe talks to amazon boss jeff bezos , bankers , brokers and investors to uncover the causes of the dotcom share bubble , why it burst and the real winners and losers of " the great dot con " . ^ ^ back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- feedback -pipe- ©
