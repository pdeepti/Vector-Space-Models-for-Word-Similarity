the company would not confirm where the jobs would be cut , but operations in the uk , ireland , us , canada , brazil , israel , china , japan and india were all susceptible , a spokesperson said .
the latest round of cuts will be made at the company 's wireless infrastructure units by the end of the year , bringing the total number of job losses to 32,000 , or 21.8 % of its total workforce at the end of 2000 .
motorola said weaker-than-expected demand for its products meant sales were flat in the third quarter rather than growing 5 % from the previous quarter .
more uk cuts ?
plants in the uk and ireland " are n't immune " from the cutbacks , a spokesman for the company warned .
the latest job losses come just months after 3,000 staff lost their jobs when the firm closed its bathgate plant in west lothian , scotland .
motorola 's announcement follows warnings by swedish rival ericsson and french telecom equipment maker alcatel .
ericsson , the world 's largest wireless infrastructure firm and third biggest mobile phone maker , said on tuesday a recovery in the telecoms industry was unlikely until after next year , kicking off a share selling spree .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- measuring britain 's real economy categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 7 september , 2001 , 05:13 gmt 06:13 uk measuring britain 's real economy by bbc news online 's james arnold you 're probably getting sick of it by now .
for the past few months , there has been feverish speculation over whether britain is in , or approaching , recession .
a recession , as economists keep reminding us , is when output falls for two successive quarters .
but abstruse economic statistics are one thing .
most people 's definition of a real slump is when the bad times start to lap up to their own front door .
with that in mind , bbc news online offers a trawl through some unconventional - and far from scientific - measurements of economic performance , in an attempt to find out what 's really going on .
when bad times bite , the theory goes , people trim back on non-essentials .
golf 's glory days could be over expensive leisure pursuits are usually first for the chop .
but the picture is mixed .
on the one hand , golf - the sport most redolent of smug prosperity - is starting to stutter .
after growing at an annual 12 % for the last few years , growth in the british golf market has slowed to below 6 % , according to travel trade gazette , and some once-booming resorts are struggling to attract custom .
on the other hand , gym membership - currently a national 3 million and counting - is continuing to grow .
holmes place , one of the biggest gym operators in britain , recently reported a 35 % annual jump in profits .
verdict : too close to call .
travel , that bellwether of economic activity , is also slowing down .
taxis are becoming ever scarcer government statistics show that annual growth in traffic levels has come to a complete halt this year , with goods vehicle traffic falling by an annual 2 % .
at the top end of the market , things are looking bleak .
manganese bronze , the firm that makes most london black taxis , sold 2,483 cabs in the year to september , compared with 3,361 for the same period a year earlier .
as for the holiday trade , it 's still a little early to tell what sort of season this has been - and figures are in any case skewed by the effects of foot-and-mouth disease .
but the association of british travel agents reckons that overseas holidays grew by a paltry 2-3 % this year .
verdict : recession .
booming sales are normally a sign of economic health .
but government figures showing that british alcohol consumption rose by more than 40 % year on year in the first quarter are n't exactly cause for comfort .
boozing for britain alcohol , like chocolate and a few other comfort foods , is one of the few goods that benefit from hard economic times .
at the same time , britons ' overall food consumption - measured in calorie terms - actually fell this year .
verdict : recession .
overall , the media sector is facing hard times .
but consumer magazines - especially those aimed at women - are booming .
some mags are avoiding the media slump the latest audit bureau of circulation figures show that sales in the consumer mag sector grew by 13 % this year , fuelled by a number of splashy launches , and the increasing popularity of in-store publications .
britain 's biggest-circulation consumer magazine , apparently , is a promotional magazine published by boot 's chemists .
verdict : boom .
it 's no surprise that among the main beneficiaries of a slump are the discount retailers .
and they are prospering .
matalan , the country 's biggest budget retailer , recently announced record profits , and is set to become a member of the elite ftse-100 stock market group .
german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl continue their advance into the country , and us wholesale giant costco recently announced the opening of two massive stores .
going cheap , and selling fast and pawnbrokers , those eager harbingers of depression , are on the rebound .
after nearly disappearing as a business during the 1980s , the spruced-up pawn industry is now worth a reported £ 100m a year .
at the same time , mid-market and premium retailers - most famously marks & spencer - are feeling the pain .
verdict : recession one of the most curious economic indicators is the surprising resurgence of that most opulent of habits - sending children to boarding school .
eton bounces back according to the latest census from the independent schools information service , girls ' boarding has registered its first rise in more than 20 years .
and boys ' boarding , although still falling , is dropping at its slowest-ever rate .
this is not necessarily an indicator of out-and-out prosperity : most of the rebound can be attributed to the harry potter effect , and the lavish publicity given to media darling prince william 's days at eton .
verdict : mini-boom .
and finally , bbc news online searched an online database of uk news articles for mentions of the words " recession " and " boom " .
during the first eight months of this year , the word " recession " was mentioned 13,256 times , compared with 12,257 for " boom " .
during the same period of last year , there were 12,327 " booms " , but a mere 6,824 " recessions " .
mixed signals so a mixed picture overall , then - arguably inclining more towards belt-tightening than splashing out .
but while the results are n't exactly conclusive , there is a serious point here .
few people are satisfied with the way we and almost every other country measure our success - rises in gross domestic product , or economic output .
in a country like britain , which produces more than its fair share of goods and services , and where far more people die from too much food than too little , a rise in output is not an unequivocal cause for celebration .
economists would love to come up with some measure of contentment or security , an index that mixes our monetary wealth with factors calculating happiness , creativity or fulfilment .
trouble is , no one has the foggiest idea of what such an index should comprise .

viasystems is to close its plant at longbenton , north tyneside , with the loss of 525 jobs , and is cutting 325 posts in south shields .
a meeting between the amalgamated engineering and electrical union -lrb- aeeu -rrb- and management was held on friday .
union regional secretary mel barras , who wants to see the number of job losses reduced , said : " there was a frank discussion and exchange of views .
" we put forward our points of view and management will be replying on 12 september , when we have our next meeting . "
what makes this decision especially worrying is the way that workers were not kept informed of the company 's plans gordon adam , north-east mep mr barras said : " we want to mitigate the number of redundancies and to see the company keep the longbenton plant open in some capacity .
" we are hopeful we can save some jobs . "
there is a 90-day consultation period for both sides to thrash out various issues .
investment aid mr barras said no-one had yet been served with their notice , nor had any criteria been laid down by the firm about who would lose their job in south shields .
since the redundancy announcement was made on 3 september there have been calls for viasystems to pay back £ 17m of government aid .
the money was designed to encourage investment in the north-east of england .
viasystems received the cash over five years in a scheme aimed at creating jobs in areas of high unemployment .
the firm , which makes printed circuit boards , blamed a continuing downturn in the global electronics market for the job losses .

he said : " what makes this decision especially worrying is the way that workers were not kept informed of the company 's plans for longbenton and south shields . "
' volatile market ' regional development agency one northeast is bringing together a task force to look at ways of reducing the impact of the job losses .
chairman dr john bridge said : " viasystems is involved in a particularly volatile market that has severely affected the productivity of its sites . "
viasystems transferred ownership of the tyneside plants to epcbg in march 2000 , licensing the sites to continue to trade as viasystems .

in the past , icann has been criticised for being undemocratic , badly run and overly secretive .
membership ' poorly managed ' icann is proposing that holders of domain names should make up the so-called " at-large " membership which votes for who runs the organisation .

public interest groups say all internet users should have a greater say over icann decisions that affect the landscape of the net .
icann is a private , non-profit organisation based in california .

it found there were already about 41 million domain name holders .
more are expected with the emergence of the new domains like .biz and .info.
icann 's current proposal would allow companies and individuals who own websites to elect six board members , with each coming from a different geographical region .
currently , there are nine " at-large " members , five of whom were elected by the internet community last year and four of whom were appointed as members shortly after icann was formed in late 1998 .
the organisation is proposing new " at-large " member elections in 2002 .
a final draft of the report is expected to be submitted during the icann meeting in november in california .
" while the icann board is not expected to act at this meeting , we are setting the terms of the debate this fall about the future of democratic participation in icann 's internet management function , " said mr davidson .
