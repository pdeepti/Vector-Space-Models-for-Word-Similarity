bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- letter from america -pipe- east meets west news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : programmes : letter from america news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - feedback help editions change to uk tuesday , 7 august , 2001 , 08:01 gmt 09:01 uk east meets west if i were as sprightly as i was when , as mr shakespeare put it , the heyday in the blood was young , this letter would be datelined canberra .
for that is where i most certainly should be or have been during a remarkable 24 hours last week when both secretary of state colin powell and secretary of defence donald rumsfeld , after their session with the rulers of china , chose to fly off , not back to washington , but to the bottom of the world and call on the oldest and stoutest of america 's allies in the pacific .
it was time , the president decided , for his two leading handlers of foreign policy - not just the american ambassador - to sit in on the australian government 's annual joint meeting on diplomacy and defence , which is not an institution that has had much , if any , coverage before now .
but the new administration , being staffed mostly with men and women who 've not been prominent in national politics , has been surprised by a discovery that many old american diplomats and politicians made long ago and learned more or less patiently to live with .
this was and is - how to put this delicately ? - nothing more complicated than the general european ignorance of america 's long history and continuous concern with pacifica and the far east .
ask a few simple questions of intelligent , educated europeans - including , if you 'll excuse the inclusion , britons - and it will , i think , sharpen the point .
what was the biggest amphibious operation in the history of the second world war and therefore in human history ?
oh , of course , the invasion of normandy in june 1944 .
wrong .
by big , of course , i mean the number of men involved , the number of weapons , tanks , planes , landing craft - and initial casualties .
it was the american navy and marine invasion of okinawa in april 1945 , the most important and crucial of american battles in the whole second world war .
okinawa is the largest of the ryukyu islands , 400 miles south of the southern tip of japan , about 700 miles short of tokyo .
the purpose of this landing was to crush the japanese garrison and secure a solid base for the final invasion of the japanese mainland .
the shipping required to put , initially , 50,000 men ashore suffered many sinkings and appalling damage from kamikaze pilots .
the battle took almost three months .
and the japanese did not surrender until six weeks after that may day in europe when , as the newspaper headlines had it : " the war is over " .
the tenacious japanese garrison of 120,000 men did not give up until 103,000 of them had died - a fact grimly recalled by president truman , general marshall and two other just men when they began to calculate what would be the cost in american lives if they pursued the main strategy of taking the japanese islands one by one before the mainland invasion .
the japanese , mr truman and his advisors believed , were prepared to lose three or four million soldiers and civilians .
the most conservative guess on our side was one and a half to two million american losses .
it was this sombre calculation that after days and nights of appraisal and agonised reappraisal they decided to drop the hiroshima bomb .
okinawa remains in the american memory as poignant as the battles of the somme in the french and british memory .
after the war , at the summit meetings of roosevelt , churchill and stalin , the americans kept bringing up the future of korea , of french indo china - later vietnam - and the looming possibility of mainland china being taken over by the communists .
these american anxieties were to the others not much more than irritants getting in the way of the main problem - the gloomy prospect of an independent poland and the soviet union 's drifting satellites .
time and again mr churchill privately deplored the americans ' " illusions " about china as a coming great power and begrudged the time roosevelt gave to her .
and later he told montgomery : " korea does n't really matter .
i 'd never heard the place till i was 74 . "
and four years later he confessed to his doctor : " i have lived 78 years without ever hearing of bloody places like cambodia . "
today i doubt there 's an educated american of middle age who at the mention of cambodia does not wince at the name of pol pot - the third of the murderous tyrants of the 20th century , a paranoiac as wounding to its civilisation as his brother tyrants stalin and hitler .
from the end of the second war in tokyo bay americans were as much concerned with the outcome of the chinese civil war as with the fate of devastated europe .
general marshall , as truman 's secretary of state , spent a whole year trying to reconcile chiang kai-shek with mao tse tung , the communist leader .
they 'd been allies during the war against the japanese .
secretary marshall failed .
the surrender of china to communism was the first of three traumas , followed by korea and seven years in vietnam , which planted in americans a deep anxiety about the future of communism across asia .
throughout the 1950s , ' 60s and until the humiliating end of the vietnamese war , americans feared the dragon 's tread in the far east as much as the slamming of the iron curtain in eastern europe .
one thing that any european student of the united states has to learn is the long relationship between china and the united states - beginning in the 18th century with a very lively barter trade .
in the 19th century china was flooded with american christian missionaries .
and , as a compulsory item in the history lessons of americans when i first came here , was the fact that president teddy roosevelt was the first head of state to receive the nobel peace prize for having mediated the russo-japanese war .
the more ominous fact was that tiny japan , whom no european could ever imagine as a serious power , had defeated the great russian empire - trouble ahead !
throughout my first year here at yale i was puzzled at what my well-informed friends called the antics of the towering newspaper tycoon of the time - william randolph hearst .
he had a nationwide spread of papers and as he looked out on the pacific from his mountain mansion in california , at least once a week , he 'd go on editorially in highly passionate prose about the yellow peril - the imminent rise and triumph of japan or china or both .
this behaviour seemed hysterical and silly until the astounding afternoon of 7 december 1941 when president franklin roosevelt learned that the japanese airforce had flown 4,000 miles east and sunk from the air - which could n't be done - five battleships , 14 other ships , 120 aircraft , 2,000 seamen , 400 civilians , all snuggly assembled at a place called pearl harbour .
that afternoon i was staying with the head of the british supply mission in washington and listening to the new york philharmonic broadcast .
when the words came panting over the radio we took out an atlas to see where was pearl harbour .
it was the base of the united states pacific fleet .
so admiral yamamoto , not hitler , was the cause , within 24 hours , of america 's entry into the second world war .
for over a year after the united states was in the war its attention and its participation was of course overwhelmingly devoted to the pacific and the nations around its rim .
america 's first hero was general macarthur .
but the soldier who sprang from major to general overnight was an obscure aide to macarthur , stationed in the philippines .
he was picked by general marshall , the chief of staff in washington , to become supreme commander of all allied forces .
first , because he predicted that the war in europe would be an industrial war of aircraft and tanks and movement and because in a report to marshall he saw - insisted - that the base of the pacific war , to have and to hold , must be australia .
he knew what most americans and all europeans have to learn is how different your world and its potential enemies look when you 're out there in the far east , which they call the near north and where for years the intentions of sukarno were of more anxious concern than the plans of stalin .
any administration made up of men and women brought up on these experiences , these exploits , this asian and pacific history has to be more puzzled than embarrassed when they hear every day an outraged cry from european politicians and newspapers alike : " do you realise that europe is horrified by bush 's policies ? "
a statesmen who would not care to be identified remarked the other day : " you know , when we get up in the morning we do n't feel our first obligation is to please or displease europe .
" when we think of our allies we have to think not only of nato and western europe but about japan and taiwan and south korea and indonesia and the possible consequences of our military treaty with australia . "
it must have been an enormously welcome novelty for the australians to see for once the two leading american cabinet officers appear in person to re-affirm that pledge .
it does n't mean for a day or a night that the united states has , in an idiot tabloid phrase , " turned its back on europe " or ceases from being knee deep with britain -lrb- for one -rrb- in kosovo .
" we shall stay there , " said the president , " as long as we 're needed . "

larry adler was the best-known mouth organist in the world .
his music for the classic film genevieve in 1953 made him a wealthy man - and famous in england , his adopted home .
his life was a who 's who of celebrity associations .
he played with everyone from fred astaire to sir elton john and counted kings and prime ministers among his friends .
lawrence cecil adler was born in baltimore , maryland , on 10 february 1914 , the son of louis and sadie adler .
at the age of five , he was taken to a rachmaninov concert and developed his own musical skills within the framework of the adler family 's orthodox judaism .
he was the youngest cantor , singer in a synagogue , in baltimore and made himself unpopular by chiding his schoolmates for their lack of religious piety .
runaway he was enrolled at the prestigious peabody school of music to study the piano .
shortly afterwards he started playing the harmonica , which he always called a " mouth organ " .
still a teenager , he ran away to new york where , with his parents ' eventual consent , he became a professional musician .
adler 's virtuosity was such that he could pick out a tune simply by hearing it once and he brought to the harmonica the musical richness which was once the reserve of purely classical soloists .
the chicago herald said adler was able to produce " a tone reminiscent of many instruments , which tone is as varied as those that emerge from a symphony orchestra " .
after seeing adler play in new york in 1934 , the english impresario c b cochrane was so impressed that he immediately offered to sign the young man to star in his london review , streamline .
before long he was playing for , and being fÃªted by , the crowned heads of europe as well as former monarchs like the duke of windsor .
respectable in the 30s and 40s he worked with everyone from big bands to george gershwin and the british composer vaughan williams , who wrote a work especially for him .
to many he was the man who made the mouth organ respectable - though he never meant to .
he once admitted , " all i wanted to do was to get the hell out of baltimore , which i hated .
i wanted to go on the stage , which i was magnetically drawn to . "
a friend of the stars , charlie chaplin was a personal friend and he romanced such screen goddesses as greta garbo and ingrid bergman .
the war years saw larry adler entertaining allied troops .
it ended with him personally liberating the hohner harmonica factory in germany .
the company rewarded him with a crateful of the instruments .
but adler 's life changed forever in 1949 .
while on a tour of britain , he was called to testify to the mccarthyite house un-american activities committee .
refusing to do so , he stayed and made his home in england .
gershwin branded a communist in his homeland where he was blacklisted , larry adler re-built his life .
a friend of the duke of edinburgh , he belonged to thethursday club , whose members , including the actors david niven and peter ustinov , enjoyed long , boozy , lunches at wheeler 's restaurant in london 's soho .
like his hero george gershwin , larry adler understood both jazz and classical music .
he introduced gershwin 's music to classical stars like the violinist yitzhak perlman .
gershwin produced a piano-roll accompaniment for perhaps his most famous work , rhapsody in blue , for larry adler to play to .
right into his late 80s , he would delight audiences with the haunting spectacle of the playerless piano backing his music , an echo through the ages which never failed to spellbind .
celebrity in recent years , larry adler had become known to a younger audience through the glory of gershwin , the platinum-selling album of critically-acclaimed duets with modern stars like sting , lisa stansfield and meatloaf .
tom jones , whom he knew but did not perform with , held him in great affection , as did sir elton john who once remarked , " larry adler is a genius and the greatest player of his instrument ever . "
most recently , he recorded a version of tony bennett 's the autumn leaves , with the catatonia singer , cerys matthews .
he had a parallel career as a celebrity , a raconteur and funnyman .
he wrote endless letters to the satirical magazine private eye .
but larry adler 's real achievement was to take the harmonica , until then thought of as a children 's toy , onto the concert stages of the world .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- profits up at royal bank of scotland categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 7 august , 2001 , 08:49 gmt 09:49 uk profits up at royal bank of scotland the integration of natwest has boosted profits the royal bank of scotland -lrb- rbs -rrb- has announced a sharp rise in half-year profits to Â£ 2.07bn , up from $ 1.5bn in the previous year .
the figure was up 37 % , excluding one-off charges , though comparisons are complicated by the bank 's purchase of natwest last year , which swelled its business .
the company has set aside a larger than expected Â£ 367m to cover bad debts , up 19 % , or an increase of Â£ 83m .
the chairman , sir george mathewson , said that the provisions had risen largely because of an increase in the bank 's lending but the credit quality remained " strong in absolute terms " .
natwest integration rbs said the integration of natwest was " fully on track " and had cost Â£ 361m in the first half of the year generating $ 106m in profits .
the cost cutting included eliminating 16,000 jobs out of an estimated 18,000 it aimed to cut by march 2003 .
the key test for the cost benefits of the takeover is expected to come later this year when rbs starts the integration of natwest 's computer systems .
chief executive fred goodwin said there would be no big deals in the next half while the bank 's latest purchase - the retail arm of us bank mellon financial - is integrated , but a small acquisition in european acquisition may be made .
rbs gave an indication that it would report healthy results last month when it announced plans to buy mellon for $ 2.1bn in cash .
economic outlook the general economic outlook was given a cautious forecast by the bank .
" clearly we are faced with a wide range of economic scenarios , " said chairman george mathewson in a statement .
" we consider that it would be inadvisable for us to assume that any one outlook will prevail , " he said .
shares in royal bank have gained 4 % this year , outperforming the uk bank sector average by about 9 % .
on tuesday its shares made miniscule gains after the results , rising 2p to 1,642 by 0750 gmt .
the stock was held back by concerns over the larger than expected bad debt provisions , according to traders .

the figure was up 37 % , excluding one-off charges , though comparisons are complicated by the bank 's purchase of natwest last year , which swelled its business .
the company has set aside a larger than expected Â£ 367m to cover bad debts , up 19 % , or an increase of Â£ 83m .
the chairman , sir george mathewson , said that the provisions had risen largely because of an increase in the bank 's lending but the credit quality remained " strong in absolute terms " .
natwest integration rbs said the integration of natwest was " fully on track " and had cost Â£ 361m in the first half of the year generating $ 106m in profits .
the cost cutting included eliminating 16,000 jobs out of an estimated 18,000 it aimed to cut by march 2003 .
the key test for the cost benefits of the takeover is expected to come later this year when rbs starts the integration of natwest 's computer systems .
chief executive fred goodwin said there would be no big deals in the next half while the bank 's latest purchase - the retail arm of us bank mellon financial - is integrated , but a small acquisition in european acquisition may be made .
rbs gave an indication that it would report healthy results last month when it announced plans to buy mellon for $ 2.1bn in cash .
economic outlook the general economic outlook was given a cautious forecast by the bank .
" clearly we are faced with a wide range of economic scenarios , " said chairman george mathewson in a statement .
" we consider that it would be inadvisable for us to assume that any one outlook will prevail , " he said .
shares in royal bank have gained 4 % this year , outperforming the uk bank sector average by about 9 % .
on tuesday its shares made miniscule gains after the results , rising 2p to 1,642 by 0750 gmt .
the stock was held back by concerns over the larger than expected bad debt provisions , according to traders .

almost 40 farmers have each claimed compensation payments of more than Â£ 1m since the outbreak of foot-and-mouth .
how are these payments calculated ?
the amounts paid to the farmers dubbed the so-called " foot-and-mouth millionaires " seem , at first glance , quite staggering .
at least 37 farmers stand to receive payments of more than Â£ 1m each , based not on loss of income , but solely on livestock valuations .
yet these animals are their assets , and even a small business 's assets can easily top the one million mark .
but asking how much a cow - or sheep or pig - is worth is as straightforward as enquiring after the value of a car , says david brown , secretary of the livestock auctioneers association .
" cars can vary from Â£ 25 for an old wreck to Â£ 250,000 for a top-of-the-line model - you 're in much the same position with livestock . "
whereas a dairy cow on a commercial farm may be worth between Â£ 700 to Â£ 1,500 , a high-pedigree animal with prized bloodlines could be worth about Â£ 150,000 , mr brown says .
the value is calculated in writing by a valuer appointed and paid for by the government , based on the breed , age and market cycle .
prices pushed up previously , farmers could opt for a standard tariff of about Â£ 1,100 for a breeding cow , Â£ 90 for a ewe and Â£ 130 for a breeding sow .
but this has been scrapped , as it had been introduced as a temporary measure to clear bottlenecks that may have delayed the slaughter .
less than 10 % of farmers used the rates .
although set above the standard market valuation at the time , the tariffs served mainly to put an inflated minimum on market values , mr brown says .
foot-and-mouth may well be pushing up the value of the nation 's livestock , as the culls make some breeds more and more scarce , he says .
up in smoke les armstrong , of cumbria , who lost 500 cattle and 1,300 sheep to the virus in march , reacted angrily to suggestions that farmers were cashing in on the crisis .
" compare that with the footballer who got Â£ 1m tax-free for a game of football ... you put that in comparison with a lifetime 's work .
that money , i would like to remind everybody , is going to be spent again in this country . "
among the farmers due a hefty cheque is jim goldie , reportedly owed more than Â£ 4m - a sum he says is inaccurate - for the loss of pedigree sheep and cattle .
mr goldie spent more than 30 years building up his herd , only to watch his 741 charolais and limousin cattle , and 800 sheep , go up in smoke at the virus swept his two farms in dumfries and galloway , scotland .
" whatever money we got was for the value of our stock , but we got nothing for the income we lost , " mr goldie has said .
" we have seen our lives destroyed and our business wiped out and that money will go to rebuilding it . " ^ ^ back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- feedback -pipe- Â©

mark jakob admitted that he issued a fake press release on behalf of the firm in august 2000 , causing a share-price slide that cost investors $ 110m .
a man with a laptop and internet access can steal more than a man with a gun judge dickran tevrizian the fake release was distributed by internet wire , an online business news service that employed mr jakob until just before the incident .
the release claimed that emulex had lost its chief executive , was anticipating a collapse in profits and was being investigated by the us securities and exchange commission .
the firm 's shares more than halved in a quarter of an hour , allowing mr jakob profitably to " short sell " them - in other words , to sell shares that he did not own , in order to buy them back later at a lower price .
atomic bomb the sentencing judge , dickran tevrizian , said mr jakob 's crime was like " dropping an atomic bomb on the financial markets " .
and he warned that such white-collar crimes should not be underestimated .
" now we see that a man with a laptop and internet access can steal more than a man with a gun , " he said .
before he sent the fake release out , mr jakob stood to lose $ 90,000 by short-selling emulex 's shares .
but the share-price collapse allowed him to make a profit of $ 55,000 on the transaction .
troubled traders mr jakob 's conviction is only the latest in a series of scandals surrounding " day traders " - private individuals who deal in shares with their own money via the internet .
day traders tend to favour high-growth - and high-risk - technology shares , most of which are listed on the new york nasdaq exchange .
us and other authorities have become concerned that day traders are particularly vulnerable to market rumour and manipulation .
many lost extremely heavily in the recent collapse of high-tech shares - some forfeiting their houses , which had been used as collateral .
in 1999 , a day trader in atlanta shot 12 people dead , after losing thousands of dollars on the market .

us-born adler , who had been in showbiz for an astonishing 73 years , had been battling cancer and recently suffered a series of health setbacks .
he died last night at st thomas 's hospital in london surrounded by his family .
his former manager , jonathan shalit , said : " only three weeks ago we were talking about him doing a concert in china . "
" he was very active until the end , that was one of the things which made him such a remarkable man . "
the musician 's last recording was a duet of young at heart with cerys matthews from the welsh pop band catatonia .
she joked at the time that she preferred older men .
he was known for his original collaborations with musicians such as george gershwin , kate bush , sting and composer vaughan williams , but also his own virtuoso performances .
showbusiness friends , including elton john , sting and sir george martin , had sent messages in recent days to the legend .
jazz trumpeter and broadcaster humphrey lyttleton told bbc news online what an inspiration adler had been .
" he made wonderful music , you just ca n't get away from it , the sound he got out of the harmonica was as great as yehudi menuhin could get from a violin , " he said .
" he could express himself equally well in pop , jazz or classical music . "
self-taught lawrence cecil adler , who was jewish , was born in baltimore , usa on 10 february 1914 .
he taught himself the harmonica and began to play professionally at the age of 14 .
adler moved to the uk in 1949 having been forced to leave the states after accusations of pro-communist sympathies during the mccarthy era .
the slurs ruined his career in the us , though he was widely respected for his refusal to accuse other musicians or acquaintances .
besides his musical fame , adler also appeared in a number of films - playing himself .
he was also known as a prolific letter writer , his correspondence to the satirical magazine private eye becoming legendary .
he also wrote an autobiography - it ai n't necessarily so - in 1985 , and worked as a food critic for harper 's & queen .
the 1953 movie genevieve brought him an oscar nomination for his work on the soundtrack , although his name was originally kept off the credits because of the mccarthy blacklisting .
adler is survived by four children , two grandchildren and two great grandchildren .

by bbc news online 's north america business reporter , david schepp ever since women started making inroads into us corporate boardrooms in the 1970s , some have been highly criticised for being too pushy - even bitchy .
female executives , who make up just 12 % of the total in the us , often cite their ability to be tough and direct as the reason for their upward mobility and eventual success .
and that same straight-forwardness can eventually lead to problems .
while aggressiveness is generally viewed as a positive trait within men who hold key positions in corporate america , it is often viewed negatively when expressed by women executives .
with that in mind , a programme has developed to help women executives become softer - call it a boot camp .
' bully broads ' and ' ice queens ' at the growth and leadership centre -lrb- glc -rrb- in california 's silicon valley , a programme called the " bully broads " has been created to address the problem of overly assertive women executives in today 's workplace .
author jean hollands believes women can rise to the top and be nice it was spearheaded by author and glc founder and president jean hollands in the late 1990s .
touted as a scheme for " exceptional women who want to share and learn from each other " , the course instructs attendees on how not to sabotage their careers as they climb the corporate ladder .
some of the techniques ms hollands administers include speaking more softly and deliberately and relying on self-deprecating humour to diffuse tense situations .
criticism not that the " bully broads " programme is without its detractors .
some have called the title politically incorrect , while others say it merely adds to the perception that somehow female executives have to be more adroit at their jobs than their male counterparts .
ms hollands , however , is unapologetic and has said women in the workplace - just like mothers in the home - are expected to display greater people skills .
the " bully broads " sessions are just one part of a three-month leadership programme glc offers male and female executives in need of career rehabilitation .
