microsoft , which accounts for more than 90 % of korea 's operating system market , is using its monopolistic position to force local pc makers to buy windows xp and other software features daum communications daum communications , a seoul-based internet service provider , has filed a complaint against the software giant with the korea fair trade commission .
the company says microsoft 's bundling of functions like instant messaging , internet telephony and digital picture handling amounts to an unfair trade practice .
daum has 20 % of korea 's instant messaging market .
" microsoft , which accounts for more than 90 % of korea 's operating system market , is using its monopolistic position to force local pc makers to buy windows xp and other software features , " the company said .
microsoft korea said it could not comment before it had been through the complaint in detail .
bundling the question of bundling has dogged microsoft for years , ever since it started including the internet explorer web browser in its operating system .
xp , which is expected in shops in october , takes the issue further by including a string of functions which third-party manufacturers complain could put them out of business .
the question of whether that amounts to illegal action under us antitrust laws remains to be concluded , and is one of the tasks facing the new judge running the us government 's case against microsoft .
according to opponents , microsoft uses its muscle to ensure it controls as many ways of accessing information - especially that which could be charged for , such as music and video - over the internet .
its media player software has been accused of breaking other forms of multimedia playback software installed on windows pcs .
and its plans to include " smart tags " - designed , detractors say , to push users to websites which are microsoft allies - were withdrawn after a hail of protests from privacy and consumer advocates .

the state department warning follows the speech at the weekend by the libyan foreign minister , abdel rahman shalqam , in which he said the american oil companies will lose their operating licences if they do not return next year .
a state department spokesman in washington said libya must continue to protect the operating licences of american oil corporations , even though the installations have remained derelict for the last 15 years .
the spokesman said that any move to prejudice the interests of the american companies would make it difficult for libya to develop the kind of relationship with the us that libya says it wants .
normalising relations over the weekend , foreign minister abdel rahman shalqam said libya was ready to hand over american concessions to other foreign oil companies if they did not return to libya by next year .
but he also stated that libya wanted to restore normal relations with washington .
in recent months , the libyan leader , colonel gadaffi , has taken an increasingly pragmatic approach in relations with western countries .
resentment european business people who have moved back to libya say there is much resentment that continuing wrangling over the lockerbie affair has prevented the us following the united nations ' lead , which eased international sanctions against libya two years ago .
the american embargo goes back before lockerbie to 1986 , when president reagan ordered four us oil companies to withdraw from libya because of its alleged links with terrorism .
last month , much to the annoyance of libya , and indeed the american oil companies , president bush renewed the unilateral embargo for a further five years .

the scottish food advisory committee wants monitoring to take place on livestock returning to fields which have lain empty for six months .
it is hoping that a framework can be drawn up and substantial funding put together for detailed research .
the committee 's chairman , sir john arbuthnott , said he believed useful information could be gained about the source and spread of bacteria , and potentially deadly organisms like e.coli o157 .
e.coli 0157 : potentially deadly bacterium " we 've had a unique situation here for months , " sir john said .
" the land is fallow and there is an ideal opportunity to monitor the stock as it comes onto the farms , to ascertain when animals begin to acquire potentially harmful and harmless organisms in a way that we do n't understand .
" we do n't know for instance , in scotland , where e.coli o157 comes from and how it gets into the herd , and we might be able to find that out . "
the e.coli taskforce outlined food safety and environmental advice designed to protect people from potentially deadly bacterium .
in june , 13 girl guides and their leader contracted e.coli o157 after camping in a field in inverclyde .
two key themes the taskforce concentrated on were education and communication to minimise the risks of bacteria .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- rules on ' hidden ' medication categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 5 september , 2001 , 06:21 gmt 07:21 uk rules on ' hidden ' medication some patients are given pills in food or drinks the nurses ' governing body has approved controversial guidelines on when patients can be given medication " hidden " in their food or drink .
covert medication is given when a patient is unable to consent because they can not understand what they are being asked , and doctors and nurses think their condition would be improved with medication .
campaigners for the elderly have criticised the move , saying giving " secret " medication to patients " can not be condoned " .
but ahead of the ukcc 's discussion of the issue on wednesday , president alison norman said publishing guidelines was important , as it would bring the " complex " issue out into the open and thus reassure both patients and medical staff . "
she told bbc radio 4 's today programme bringing the practice out into the open should remove the suspicion that patients were sometimes given covert medication for the convenience of staff , rather than their own needs .
it is a denial of people with dementia 's independence and dignity to give them medication without their knowledge harry cayton , alzheimer 's society the new guidance will cover children , people with dementia in care homes and those with learning disabilities .
patients detained under the mental health act , would also be covered by the ukcc guidelines - where the treatment in question does not relate to their mental illness .
the ukcc says patients should be presumed to have the mental capacity to consent or refuse treatment , unless they : are unable to take in and retain information are unable to believe that information are unable to " weigh-up " the information as part of a decision-making process .
it stresses that where patients can make a decision , refusal of treatment should be respected .
covert medication should be seen as an emergency procedure , rather than routine , and nurses should talk to other members of staff and patients relatives and carers before going ahead , the ukcc said .
and staff should check with their employers ' legal advisors , they said .
studies have suggested that around 70 % of staff working with vulnerable patients have faced the dilemma of whether they should give medication covertly .
almost all felt the practice was justified " on some occasions " .
ms norman gave the example of a patient who refused to take a tablet , not realising that they had a chest infection and needed an antibiotic .
professional concern but the ukcc says the patient 's interests must be paramount at all times , and the nurse has to be prepared to be accountable for their actions .
any abuse of the procedure would be professional misconduct which could lead to them being struck off .
joe nichols , professional officer for mental health and learning disabilities at the ukcc , told bbc news online said the guidance was aimed at helping staff make decisions in individual cases .
" in certain exceptional circumstances , it can be done , " he said .
" but we 're trying to find a way to assist the registered nurses in coming to a decision as to whether to do it or not . "
harry cayton , chief executive of the alzheimer 's society criticised the rules : " people with dementia are too frequently given powerful sedative and anti-psychotic drugs which make life easier for care staff .
" this may not be in the best interests of the patient .
" we are concerned that the guidelines do n't go far enough to help ensure that older people , and in particular people with alzheimer 's who are unable to give their consent , are only given drugs which are in their best interests . "
tessa harding , of help the aged said the guidelines set a dangerous precedent .

covert medication is given when a patient is unable to consent because they can not understand what they are being asked , and doctors and nurses think their condition would be improved with medication .
campaigners for the elderly have criticised the move , saying giving " secret " medication to patients " can not be condoned " .
but ahead of the ukcc 's discussion of the issue on wednesday , president alison norman said publishing guidelines was important , as it would bring the " complex " issue out into the open and thus reassure both patients and medical staff . "
she told bbc radio 4 's today programme bringing the practice out into the open should remove the suspicion that patients were sometimes given covert medication for the convenience of staff , rather than their own needs .
it is a denial of people with dementia 's independence and dignity to give them medication without their knowledge harry cayton , alzheimer 's society the new guidance will cover children , people with dementia in care homes and those with learning disabilities .
patients detained under the mental health act , would also be covered by the ukcc guidelines - where the treatment in question does not relate to their mental illness .
the ukcc says patients should be presumed to have the mental capacity to consent or refuse treatment , unless they : are unable to take in and retain information are unable to believe that information are unable to " weigh-up " the information as part of a decision-making process .
it stresses that where patients can make a decision , refusal of treatment should be respected .
covert medication should be seen as an emergency procedure , rather than routine , and nurses should talk to other members of staff and patients relatives and carers before going ahead , the ukcc said .
and staff should check with their employers ' legal advisors , they said .
studies have suggested that around 70 % of staff working with vulnerable patients have faced the dilemma of whether they should give medication covertly .
almost all felt the practice was justified " on some occasions " .
ms norman gave the example of a patient who refused to take a tablet , not realising that they had a chest infection and needed an antibiotic .
professional concern but the ukcc says the patient 's interests must be paramount at all times , and the nurse has to be prepared to be accountable for their actions .
any abuse of the procedure would be professional misconduct which could lead to them being struck off .
joe nichols , professional officer for mental health and learning disabilities at the ukcc , told bbc news online said the guidance was aimed at helping staff make decisions in individual cases .
" in certain exceptional circumstances , it can be done , " he said .
" but we 're trying to find a way to assist the registered nurses in coming to a decision as to whether to do it or not . "
harry cayton , chief executive of the alzheimer 's society criticised the rules : " people with dementia are too frequently given powerful sedative and anti-psychotic drugs which make life easier for care staff .
" this may not be in the best interests of the patient .
" we are concerned that the guidelines do n't go far enough to help ensure that older people , and in particular people with alzheimer 's who are unable to give their consent , are only given drugs which are in their best interests . "
tessa harding , of help the aged said the guidelines set a dangerous precedent .
" they violate the principle that patients must consent to treatment , having been fully informed and consulted .
everyone , including older people , has the right to refuse treatment . "

the couple confirmed on monday they were to end their three-year marriage .
" this is an absolutely amicable separation and it is a mutual decision between both of us , " winslet told reporters on tuesday .
" jim and i have great respect for each other .
there is no malice at all .
it is extremely sad but we are all fine . "
arguments meanwhile threapleton 's grandfather , norman , told a tabloid newspaper that winslet 's success had put enormous pressure on the couple .
he said that his grandson wanted to be recognised in his own right and not " just as kate 's husband " .
" she 's a star while jim is trying to make his way in his own field , " he told the mirror .
" jim is a bit of a quiet type and i do n't know whether all this theatrical and film life has gone down well with him . "
the titanic star has taken the couple 's daughter mia and moved back into the north london flat she used to share with her sister .

' priority ' winslet 's spokesman robert garlock said nobody else was involved .

the tenant in the flat below miss winslet 's said he had heard a couple arguing upstairs on monday night and on tuesday morning , but could not say who it was .
the actress , whose new film enigma is to be released soon , met assistant director threapleton during the filming of hideous kinky in morocco in 1997 .
she became an international celebrity after appearing in the blockbuster movie titanic , and followed up that success with a host of appearances in smaller , low-key movies .

for translation , see the foot of the page it 's 40 years since the introduction of the initial teaching alphabet , which was devised to teach young children to read .
but many people found it did them no favours in the long run , says bbc news online 's megan lane .
what do you suppose the above sentence says ?
chances are that you will only be able to decipher it if you are a child of the 1960s who went to a progressive school .
it 's written in the initial teaching alphabet -lrb- ita -rrb- , a system designed by sir james pitman - grandson of the man who devised pitman 's shorthand - to help young children learn to read more quickly .
it uses the 26 letters of the roman alphabet and another 14 characters to represent sounds such as " oo " and " th " .
sentences written in ita are all in lower case .
it was introduced into several english schools in 1961 , and soon spread to the united states and australia .
new pupils - and their parents - were expected to read and spell using the expanded alphabet .
once they reached seven years old , the children had to switch to the standard alphabet and accepted spellings .
illogical and inconsistent sir james 's aim was to aid dyslexics and end illiteracy by providing children with a logical spelling system , in which words were made up of speech sounds .
if you make it easier to read and spell , children will learn faster john gledhill , simplified spelling society after all , about 13 % of english words are not spelt the way they sound .
and , according to research published today , children take longer to learn basic reading skills in english than in other european languages .
professor philip seymour , of the university of dundee , says this is mainly because of the complex syllable structure and inconsistent spelling system of english .
coded language sir james based the system on the " phonotypy " of sir isaac pitman -lrb- his grandfather -rrb- and the " nue speling " of the simplified spelling society , of which he was a member .
the thinking went that as children became fluent in ita , they would become aware of conventional spelling and move seamlessly into the normal alphabet .
did it work ?
opinions vary , but the system was never successfully made mainstream .
one former pupil has very strong views about it : " i suffered ita for my first few years at school , with the consequence that at the age of seven i could barely read or write , " he says .
and edwin robson , who was taught ita in the 1960s , says many of his friends blame their poor spelling on being taught this system in their first year of school .
but he personally did n't have any problem , and can still remember it today .
his family still recounts the time when his sister went to stay with grandma in northumberland , and wrote her first letter home to newcastle .
" grandma could n't understand the contents of the ita letter , but put it in an envelope and posted it home all the same .
it read : ' we went to the beach .
we saw two horses .
they were pissing in the sea . " '
from ita to txt msgs john gledhill , of the simplified spelling society , says ita was hailed as pioneering in its day .
" it fully demonstrated that if you make it easier to read and spell , children will learn faster .
but it was n't a long-term solution because the system was a bit messy . "
although society members may raise a glass in memory of ita , few now champion its use , mr gledhill says .
instead , they are keen to see consistency , with double letters dropped , and a cull of the many and varied spellings for " e " sounds .
although e-mail and text messages have filtered shortcuts into the language , these are not necessarily the same from person to person , mr gledhill says .
" people make up shortcuts as they go along , but these may not be understood outside their circle of friends . "
but the enthusiasm for texting has made it clear that english speakers are frustrated with conventional spelling .
the sentence above reads : " the ice angel gave the owl a ring . "
it might be meaningless , but it illustrates some of the system 's more unusual sound shapes .
click here to add your comments some comments so far : a big problem with ita was that phonetic spelling does n't account for regional accents .
anyone used to hearing words pronounced with a scots , welsh or scouse accent was completely lost .
rod maxwell , scotland i am dyslexic and learned ita at school .
i was already able to read and write simple words when i arrived at school but ita crippled me .
this was because when i wrote the words i knew to be correct i was told they were wrong .
chris , uk we could write notes to each other without our parents or teachers in the grown-up children 's classes being able read them .
since moving to london i have n't found anyone i can pass ita notes to during long meetings. jæn -lrb- jane -rrb- , uk i was in my second year 's teaching in luton in 1968 .
ita seemed to be a brilliant way of pushing the children on and they learned to read much earlier than usual .
but - and the but is enourmous - some could not make the transition .
i do n't think they 'll ever unlearn ita spelling .
mrs patricia collett , england i had a couple of ladybird books written in ita , including one about fishermen and their trawlers - lots of scope for unusual sounds like halibut and sturgeon .
i do n't recall it doing me any harm .
chloe williams , england i have to think about how to spell some very simple words because they contain either a silent or mispronounced letter .
i do n't think ita damaged my ability to spell , but has sown a seed in my subconscious that acts as a hurdle .
sebastian andrews , england i love ita and have a book of famous quotes , speeches and poetry all " translated " into ita , including winston churchill 's war speeches .
anthony richards , uk ita made me the bad speller i am today .
yet we make same mistakes again and again .
my son now learns to read by word recognition , associating the appearance of a word with a picture over and over until he knows it .
when he meets a new word , he ca n't put the letters together to form the word .
instead the teacher tells him the word and asks him to memorise it .
trevor hentzschel , uk ita is a classic case of missing the point .
if you are taught english - inconsistencies and all - from an early age , you develop an intuition for how words should look .
doug trumpshaw , uk i went to a conservative school and saw the spelling issue from the other end of the telescope .

for translation , see the foot of the page it 's 40 years since the introduction of the initial teaching alphabet , which was devised to teach young children to read .
but many people found it did them no favours in the long run , says bbc news online 's megan lane .
what do you suppose the above sentence says ?
chances are that you will only be able to decipher it if you are a child of the 1960s who went to a progressive school .
the 44 characters in the initial teaching alphabet it 's written in the initial teaching alphabet -lrb- ita -rrb- , a system designed by sir james pitman - grandson of the man who devised pitman 's shorthand - to help young children learn to read more quickly .
it uses the 26 letters of the roman alphabet and another 14 characters to represent sounds such as " oo " and " th " .
sentences written in ita are all in lower case .
it was introduced into several english schools in 1961 , and soon spread to the united states and australia .
new pupils - and their parents - were expected to read and spell using the expanded alphabet .
once they reached seven years old , the children had to switch to the standard alphabet and accepted spellings .
illogical and inconsistent sir james 's aim was to aid dyslexics and end illiteracy by providing children with a logical spelling system , in which words were made up of speech sounds .
if you make it easier to read and spell , children will learn faster john gledhill , simplified spelling society after all , about 13 % of english words are not spelt the way they sound .
and , according to research published today , children take longer to learn basic reading skills in english than in other european languages .
professor philip seymour , of the university of dundee , says this is mainly because of the complex syllable structure and inconsistent spelling system of english .
coded language sir james based the system on the " phonotypy " of sir isaac pitman -lrb- his grandfather -rrb- and the " nue speling " of the simplified spelling society , of which he was a member .
many have come a cropper with spelling the thinking went that as children became fluent in ita , they would become aware of conventional spelling and move seamlessly into the normal alphabet .
did it work ?
opinions vary , but the system was never successfully made mainstream .
one former pupil has very strong views about it : " i suffered ita for my first few years at school , with the consequence that at the age of seven i could barely read or write , " he says .
and edwin robson , who was taught ita in the 1960s , says many of his friends blame their poor spelling on being taught this system in their first year of school .
but he personally did n't have any problem , and can still remember it today .
his family still recounts the time when his sister went to stay with grandma in northumberland , and wrote her first letter home to newcastle .
" grandma could n't understand the contents of the ita letter , but put it in an envelope and posted it home all the same .
it read : ' we went to the beach .
we saw two horses .
they were pissing in the sea . " '
from ita to txt msgs john gledhill , of the simplified spelling society , says ita was hailed as pioneering in its day .
" it fully demonstrated that if you make it easier to read and spell , children will learn faster .
but it was n't a long-term solution because the system was a bit messy . "
texting has taken off in the past two years although society members may raise a glass in memory of ita , few now champion its use , mr gledhill says .
instead , they are keen to see consistency , with double letters dropped , and a cull of the many and varied spellings for " e " sounds .
although e-mail and text messages have filtered shortcuts into the language , these are not necessarily the same from person to person , mr gledhill says .
" people make up shortcuts as they go along , but these may not be understood outside their circle of friends . "
but the enthusiasm for texting has made it clear that english speakers are frustrated with conventional spelling .
the sentence above reads : " the ice angel gave the owl a ring . "
it might be meaningless , but it illustrates some of the system 's more unusual sound shapes .
click here to add your comments some comments so far : a big problem with ita was that phonetic spelling does n't account for regional accents .
anyone used to hearing words pronounced with a scots , welsh or scouse accent was completely lost .
rod maxwell , scotland i am dyslexic and learned ita at school .
i was already able to read and write simple words when i arrived at school but ita crippled me .
this was because when i wrote the words i knew to be correct i was told they were wrong .
chris , uk we could write notes to each other without our parents or teachers in the grown-up children 's classes being able read them .
since moving to london i have n't found anyone i can pass ita notes to during long meetings. jæn -lrb- jane -rrb- , uk i was in my second year 's teaching in luton in 1968 .
ita seemed to be a brilliant way of pushing the children on and they learned to read much earlier than usual .
but - and the but is enourmous - some could not make the transition .
i do n't think they 'll ever unlearn ita spelling .
mrs patricia collett , england i had a couple of ladybird books written in ita , including one about fishermen and their trawlers - lots of scope for unusual sounds like halibut and sturgeon .
i do n't recall it doing me any harm .
chloe williams , england i have to think about how to spell some very simple words because they contain either a silent or mispronounced letter .
i do n't think ita damaged my ability to spell , but has sown a seed in my subconscious that acts as a hurdle .
sebastian andrews , england i love ita and have a book of famous quotes , speeches and poetry all " translated " into ita , including winston churchill 's war speeches .
anthony richards , uk ita made me the bad speller i am today .
yet we make same mistakes again and again .
my son now learns to read by word recognition , associating the appearance of a word with a picture over and over until he knows it .
when he meets a new word , he ca n't put the letters together to form the word .
instead the teacher tells him the word and asks him to memorise it .
trevor hentzschel , uk ita is a classic case of missing the point .
if you are taught english - inconsistencies and all - from an early age , you develop an intuition for how words should look .
doug trumpshaw , uk i went to a conservative school and saw the spelling issue from the other end of the telescope .
our teacher passed out a workbook on spelling , warning : " the first thing you need to learn is that the same sound can be spelled different ways . "
she was referring to the workbook 's title , phonics can be fun .
harry matthews , usa it was used to teach us french pronunciation but the teacher omitted to find out if it had been used to teach us english -lrb- which it had n't -rrb- .
a clever way to ensure the linguistically challenged english never managed to learn a second language .

the national assembly 's " paving document " for education in wales has called for greater concentration on established teacher assessment methods and play .
jane davidson said distinct policies would be pursued but some plans outlined in the uk government 's education white paper , also released on wednesday , are still up for consultation across the border and welsh plans could be quite different .
the assembly will consult every school in wales on plans to limit the role and powers of school governors over staff appointments and dismissals .
assembly education minister jane davidson said the resources used in testing pupils could be better targeted used to help raise standards across the curriculum .
the abolition of the tests - scrapped partly because children are achieving higher grades - will come as part of a new foundation stage for children aged three to seven .
social skills releasing the paper for lifelong education , the learning country , ms davidson said there would be " much more focus on social skills and play " because frequent testing was not required .
she said : " we will also look at the stages at which qualifications are taken and consult on the school of the future along with action to introduce the welsh baccalaureate .
" we will widen access to lifelong learning after the age of 16 by offering new financial support to students , apprentices and trainees and setting up a credit-based qualification system . "
frequent testing has not been popular with some parents the proposals also seek to break barriers between academic and vocational training and between the stages at which qualifications are conventionally taken .
the welsh assembly set a first for devolution in july 2001 when it abolished school league tables .
the uk government 's bill for education , expected towards the end of the year , will cover provision in england and wales , but the assembly has discretion to modify plans for welsh pupils .
the uk bill proposes more private sector involvement in state-run schools , help for new teachers to pay off student loans , helping schools to share teachers and establishing more localised governing systems .
plans also afford more opportunities for specialised schools .
in wales there are no specialists and there are no plans to change the comprehensive system .
ms davidson added : " we are now starting to pursue policies that are right for wales .
" we shall take our own policy direction to get the best for wales . "
the welsh teaching union ucac welcomed the assembly 's plan .
general secretary edwin williams said : " we must congratulate the national assembly on publishing a separate paper for wales .
" this shows that education is different in wales to that in england and that the assembly is ploughing its own furrow by developing educational policies that are relevant to wales " .
but the proposals came under fire from conservative assembly member alun cairns , who branded the plan to ditch tests " ludicrous . "
he said : " tests a the age of seven help teachers and parents identify problems with a child 's reading , writing and arithmetic .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- taiwan airline deal breaks chinese wall categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 5 september , 2001 , 08:08 gmt 09:08 uk taiwan airline deal breaks chinese wall economic woes mean taipei must free up investment in china a taiwanese airline is planning to buy 25 % of a mainland peer 's cargo arm based in shanghai , in a deal which heralds concrete moves to weaken the wall separating the two economies .
china airlines - the main carrier in taiwan - is due to sign a deal with china eastern , majority owner of china cargo , on wednesday .
no matter how much money flows from china , we can say that the stalled cross-strait relationship is taking a step forward chang yih-chuan , china union real estate appraisal should the governments of taiwan and china - which still sees the former as a breakaway province - approve the deal , china airlines will gain a foothold in the mainland air traffic market , even though direct flights between the two jurisdictions have been banned since china 's civil war ended in 1949 .
the deal , for cash , should also see taiwanese executives take seats on china cargo 's board .
the plan was first mooted last year , but was shelved because of the frosty relationship between taipei and beijing .
there are further signs that this relationship is thawing , with news that taiwan 's cabinet is considering allowing chinese nationals to buy property on the island .
bridging the strait the announcement comes less than a month after a key government advisory committee in taiwan advised lifting a raft of restrictions on trading across the taiwan strait .
its proposals suggest lifting the $ 50m limit for a single investment and ending restrictions that force taiwanese companies to route funds through another territory , usually hong kong .
and direct transport , commercial and postal links could be restored for the first time since 1949 .
if chinese nationals are allowed to buy taiwanese land - as has been suggested - this could boost property prices there after a five-year lull .
" the approval -lsb- of the proposal -rsb- was in response to the economic advisory panel , a global trend of economic liberalisation and with an eye towards improving the country 's utilisation of land resources , " the cabinet said in a statement .
chinese manipulation ?
parliament still has to approve the proposal , which could prove controversial .
mainlanders are banned from buying land in taiwan - not least because of the risk that such a fundamental asset would then be open to manipulation by the mainland chinese government .
according to chang yih-chuan , president at taiwan 's china union real estate appraisal co , the psychological effect of the proposal is far more important than the financial implications .
" no matter how much money flows from china , we can say that the stalled cross-strait relationship is taking a step forward .
