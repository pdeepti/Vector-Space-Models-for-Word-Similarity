criticism came from several sources including the swedish government , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union .
the victims of the oklahoma city bombing have been given not vengeance but justice president bush swedish foreign minister anna lindh said the eu regretted the continued use of capital punishment in the us , and would be voicing its concerns at a summit with mr bush in gothenburg later this week .
mcveigh died by lethal injection at 0714 local time -lrb- 1214gmt -rrb- on monday , six years after killing 168 people in the worst-ever peacetime attack on us soil .
the 33-year-old was the first federal prisoner to be executed for 38 years .
timothy mcveigh was a cold-blooded murderer .

mcveigh : no new pictures of him were released before the execution in a statement , the german government said it opposed mcveigh 's execution on " fundamental principle " .

the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe also voiced opposition to the execution .
it was an emotional day for relatives of mcveigh 's victims " it is high time the united states rethought its attitude to the death penalty and aligned its position with the great majority of the free and democratic world , " council president lord russell-johnston said .

i 'm glad i live in a country which has made an example of this man kathleen treanor , mother of victim mcveigh remained silent throughout his execution , but had released the text of william ernest henley 's poem , invictus , as his official last words .
" my head is bloody but unbowed , " it reads , before concluding : " i am the master of my fate , i am the captain of my soul . "
journalists who witnessed the proceedings described how mcveigh made eye contact with each witness , including the relatives , and died with his eyes open .
" he lay there very still , " said witness shepard smith .
" he never said a word . "
' relief ' of the relatives one mother whose four-year-old daughter was among mcveigh 's victims greeted his death with relief .
there is nothing reasonable or moral about what we have done today .
we have made killing a part of the healing process mcveigh 's lawyer , robert nigh " i 'm glad i live in a country which has made an example of this man , " said kathleen treanor , who watched his death on the television link .
she said his death was like a full-stop at the end of a sentence , but her suffering would not end .

i 'll never get over the death of my daughter .
when i die that 's when i 'll get closure , " she said .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- mass strike threatens south korea low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo tuesday , 12 june , 2001 , 05:56 gmt 06:56 uk mass strike threatens south korea south korea is facing demonstrations from workers by bbc news ' caroline gluck in seoul south korean economic ministers have made an appeal to trade unions to call off plans for a mass general strike .
the government said the strike should be avoided at a time when national efforts were needed to overcome a serious drought and recharge the economy .
the planned strike has been branded illegal , with the government threatening stern action if necessary .
labour protests have become increasingly violent this year , reflecting growing anger at large-scale layoffs resulting from the government 's economic reforms .
union determination the appeal came as the country 's two national airline carriers began fresh negotiations with unions to try to avert a joint strike by pilots and ground staff .
management at two airlines - korean air and asiana - are holding fresh talks with the unions in an effort to avoid a walk-out and airport chaos .
but the umbrella trade union group , the korean confederation of trade unions , has rejected the appeal , saying tens of thousands of their members will go ahead with the strike on tuesday .
but the militant trade union group , the kctu , with about half a million members , said it had no plans to call off a nationwide walk-out .
the union said more than 55,000 of its members would heed a strike call on tuesday to support calls for wage increases and for the government to abandon its restructuring programme , which has led to mass lay-offs .
another eleven thousand members , at twelve hospitals , are expected to follow suit on wednesday .
severe drought at a nationally televised press conference , south korean finance minister , jin nyum , read out a statement urging trade union members to call off the planned strike on tuesday .
" unions must refrain from staging a nationwide general strike at a time when the country needs concerted efforts to overcome a severe drought and recharge the economy , " said an official statement .
the korean peninsula is currently facing its worst drought since records began nearly a century ago , forcing many farmers to abandon planting crops .
president kim dae-jung has already been forced to take action to end protests , when thousands of riot police stormed a chemical factory to end a union sit-in last week .

the government said the strike should be avoided at a time when national efforts were needed to overcome a serious drought and recharge the economy .
the planned strike has been branded illegal , with the government threatening stern action if necessary .
labour protests have become increasingly violent this year , reflecting growing anger at large-scale layoffs resulting from the government 's economic reforms .
union determination the appeal came as the country 's two national airline carriers began fresh negotiations with unions to try to avert a joint strike by pilots and ground staff .
management at two airlines - korean air and asiana - are holding fresh talks with the unions in an effort to avoid a walk-out and airport chaos .
but the umbrella trade union group , the korean confederation of trade unions , has rejected the appeal , saying tens of thousands of their members will go ahead with the strike on tuesday .
but the militant trade union group , the kctu , with about half a million members , said it had no plans to call off a nationwide walk-out .
the union said more than 55,000 of its members would heed a strike call on tuesday to support calls for wage increases and for the government to abandon its restructuring programme , which has led to mass lay-offs .
another eleven thousand members , at twelve hospitals , are expected to follow suit on wednesday .
severe drought at a nationally televised press conference , south korean finance minister , jin nyum , read out a statement urging trade union members to call off the planned strike on tuesday .
" unions must refrain from staging a nationwide general strike at a time when the country needs concerted efforts to overcome a severe drought and recharge the economy , " said an official statement .
the korean peninsula is currently facing its worst drought since records began nearly a century ago , forcing many farmers to abandon planting crops .
president kim dae-jung has already been forced to take action to end protests , when thousands of riot police stormed a chemical factory to end a union sit-in last week .

the small business agency 's end of year statement said that the number of jobs created by start-up firms had increased .
but it said new positions created by existing ledu companies were down by almost 40 % .
it pointed out that ledu helped 1,329 new companies start up last year - an increase of 10 % .
ledu has been helping small businesses in northern ireland for almost 30 years , but this is its last annual report .
it will become part of the new economic development agency from the beginning of next year .
majority the report said trading conditions were difficult over the last 12 months but it was encouraged by the performance of its client companies .
in total , 2,700 new jobs were created last year but that figure was down from 3,100 over the previous 12 months .
the vast majority of these new jobs were as a result of an increased number of new start-up businesses .
ledu said that job creation among its established firms was down , but growth in its sales - particularly in export markets - had increased significantly .
from the start of next year , ledu is to be absorbed into a super-agency with the job promotion agency , the industrial development board .
last month , the idb reported a record year for inward investment .
the figures came despite continuing job losses in the textile industry , where at least 3,000 jobs have been lost over the last 12 months .
the idb said that its remaining months in existence would be " challenging " given the fact that some technology companies were facing a significant downturn in business .

mr michael becomes minister for rural affairs , succeeding nick brown , who was minister for agriculture .
neath mp mr hain switches from energy minister to europe minister , replacing keith vaz .
mr michael - mp for cardiff south and penarth - arrived at 10 downing street on monday afternoon to be told the news in person by mr blair .
mr michael will take control of the re-named department of environment , food and rural affairs , which replaces the ministry of agriculture .
one of his immediate tasks will be to tackle the ongoing impact from foot-and-mouth , with new cases detected in settle , yorkshire .
the post is seen as a political " comeback " for mr michael , after his brief tenures as welsh assembly first secretary and welsh secretary .
mr michael had returned from the home office to wales to take over after ron davies 's " moment of madness " .
welsh rural affairs minister carwyn jones said mr michael was an " excellent appointment " to the position .
" everybody knows he 's an extremely hard worker , i 'm sure he will be a credit to the new department . "
mr hain 's firm handling of the growing unrest over miners ' industrial compensation payments has earned him a move to the foreign office .
his new title of europe minister comes after mr blair replaced robin cook at the weekend as foreign secretary amid fears of further cabinet unrest over the issue of the euro .
pontypridd mp kim howells is the new minister for tourism , film and broadcasting in the department of culture , media and sport .
it is likely to prove a controversial appointment - dr howells has previously been outspoken about s4c and tourist chiefs .
it is understood the prime minister has asked him to " rescue " the tourism industry hit hard by the foot and mouth crisis .
earlier this year , dr howells accused the wales tourist board of being run by amateurs and said the welsh spent far too much time whingeing .
he told mps on the welsh select committee that the london launch of wales 's ryder cup bid was one of the worst events he 'd attended .
meanwhile , at the wales office , secretary of state paul murphy was expected to see don touhig announced as his number 2 .
mr murphy was reappointed at the weekend after the prime minister pledged during the election campaign that he would retain the post in the new government .
beforehand there had been strong indications that the post would be axed .

the company , one of the few remaining mutual life groups , said on tuesday it would raise around Â£ 1.4bn from the flotation .
the shares are expected to jump in value on their debut , with some analysts predicting a closing day price of more than 285p .
members of the 170-year old mutual last week voted overwhelmingly in favour of demutualisation and the company received court approval on monday for the flotation , expected to take place on 9 july .
windfall most members will receive windfalls of between Â£ 450 and Â£ 540 from the float , while some policyholders can expect to get higher payouts , averaging around Â£ 2,000 .
the float will value the insurer at some Â£ 3.79bn at the mid-price , giving it a slot the uk 's ftse 100 index of blue-chip stocks .
friends provident said that nearly two-thirds of its members took part in the vote to decide whether the life insurer should give up its mutual status .
friends provident members will all receive a fixed allocation of 200 shares , with around 60 % receiving additional allocations , ranging from one share to up to 4,000 depending on the size of their policy and how long they have held it .
