they will discuss how they can allow people onto their land without undermining the current restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of foot-and-mouth disease .
as the crisis continues there is growing controversy over scottish executive restrictions which have effectively shut down scotland 's countryside .
there is very limited access , like skiing at commercial centres , but , for example , no walking or climbing in the mountains .
big landowning groups like the national trust for scotland and the john muir trust have closed their properties to the public .
on tuesday they will meet in edinburgh to discuss the latest advice from the government , which permits some access as long as the landowner has first carried out a risk assessment .
the groups are anxious to protect their own tenant farmers but tourism 's also extremely important and some will be looking to reopen areas where there is little or no risk .
scotland 's tourism industry has been badly affected by the restrictions imposed in the wake of the foot-and-mouth disease .
groups are anxious to relax such restrictions in areas which are not part of infected zones and breathe new life into the flagging industry .
on monday , the john muir trust revealed it was keen to have restrictions removed to and from ben nevis , the highest mountain in britain .
the trust 's nigel hawkins said while the body was anxious to ensure the disease had no chance of spreading , allowing climbers and walkers to scale ben nevis would not jeopardise containment plans .
mr hawkins said the trust was treating ben nevis as " a special case " .
some bodies are becoming agitated over the movement restrictions which have rendered vast swathes of the country strictly no-go areas .

in her annual report for 2000 : the health of the public in northern ireland , dr henrietta campbell said birth rates had dropped significantly in the last 15 years .
the number of babies being born was well below what would be needed to maintain the population at its present level , she added .
dr campbell said the population figures indicated that the number of older people is continuing to increase .
women make up a much greater proportion of older people , with almost twice as many women as men in the 75-and-over age group .
heart disease the report said coronary heart disease and cancer were still the main causes of death in northern ireland , with twice as many men as women dying from heart disease .
however , overall life expectancy is improving each year .
the average life expectancy of a male born in northern ireland in 2001 is 74.3 years and is 79.6 years for a female .
in children aged between one and 14 years , accidents are the most common cause of death .
' cross-departmental effort ' commenting on initiatives to improve the health of the northern ireland population , dr campbell said : " the greatest gains in our health status over the past century have been achieved through improvements in areas such as education , working conditions , housing , food safety , water supplies and the physical environment .
" for this reason , all government departments were involved in producing the consultation document and will contribute to the resulting strategy and implementation . "
the report also highlighted a number of significant events during 2000 , and detailed lessons learned by the national health service in response .
dr campbell said the response to last winter 's pressures helped the health service to cope better .
she added that the flu-immunisation campaign , launched in october 2000 , also helped to reduce the pressure on hospital beds .
however , dr campbell added : " pressures on the health service are not just seen in the winter months .
" for several years , the number of patients treated by the health service has risen steadily and the workload and activity levels have increased correspondingly . "
consultation documents the chief medical officer said the consultation paper , building the way forward in primary care , issued in december 2000 , would help " develop a clear agenda for the future of primary care here " .
" it is important that we learn the lessons from the gp fundholding scheme and from the total purchasing pilots on what has worked well and brought benefits , " she said .
dr campbell said high-profile incidents , such as the organ retention revelations , and the case of dr harold shipman had severely damaged trust between patients and doctors .
she said the consultation document , confidence in the future - for patients and for doctors , would help restore confidence in the medical profession .
dr campbell also said northern ireland health minister bairbre de brun 's consultation document investing for health " was another important event which makes a commitment to consult the public on the development of a new strategy to improve the health of all people here " .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- surveys point to aussie recession low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo tuesday , 13 march , 2001 , 07:23 gmt surveys point to aussie recession traders watch stock prices slide , but some remain optimistic .
the australian economy experienced negative economic growth during both the quarter ending in december and the quarter ending this month , according to two surveys .
if the surveys ' findings are correct , a recession will hit australia since the technical definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth .
overnight losses on the australian stock exchange reached 1.7 % .
" if you put the two quarters together , the best you can say is that the economy has stalled .
and you would have to admit that there are a lot of conditions out there that are not dissimilar to those leading to major recessions , " said national australia bank -lrb- nab -rrb- chief economist alan oster .
" we are clearly in the toughest conditions we 've had for ten years .
i think what we are seeing is ... that march was worse than december , " said mr oster .
but prime minister john howard rejected such pessimism .
" we think talk of a recession is wrong , " he said .
" we think talk in an alarmist fashion is wrong and it 's no good for business confidence and it 's really no good for anybody . "
the surveys , by nab and the consultants dun and bradstreet , showed that the australian people have lost confidence in the economy .
expectations have fallen for both employment and profit levels for the next three months .
and weak business conditions were found in several sectors of the economy , including construction , manufacturing , retail and wholesale .
optimistic government the bleak economic predictions were seen as another blow to the australian government which will hold a general election this year .
but if , as the surveys indicated , the economy begins to bottom out in june , the election could be held during an economic revival rather than during a period of economic worries .
mr howard believes the economic downturn seen in december was caused by one-off factors and insists the economy is in good shape .
" we 've now got a good financial position , our exports are growing , our consumer demand has been off the level of the last four years but -lsb- it is -rsb- still pretty solid and our interest rates are coming down , " he said .
stock markets fall the australian stock market 's s & p / asx 200 leading share index closed 1.7 % lower on tuesday at 3,264.7 .
" the market is just responding to more sentiment that the economy is slowing down faster than people expected , " said ing investment management 's geoff martin .
but mr martin remained fairly optimistic .

if the surveys ' findings are correct , a recession will hit australia since the technical definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth .
" if you put the two quarters together , the best you can say is that the economy has stalled .
and you would have to admit that there are a lot of conditions out there that are not dissimilar to those leading to major recessions , " said national australia bank -lrb- nab -rrb- chief economist alan oster .
" we are clearly in the toughest conditions we 've had for ten years .
i think what we are seeing is ... that march was worse than december , " said mr oster .
but prime minister john howard rejected such pessimism .
" we think talk of a recession is wrong , " he said .
" we think talk in an alarmist fashion is wrong and it 's no good for business confidence and it 's really no good for anybody . "
the surveys , by nab and the consultants dun and bradstreet , showed that the australian people have lost confidence in the economy .
expectations have fallen for both employment and profit levels for the next three months .
and weak business conditions were found in several sectors of the economy , including construction , manufacturing , retail and wholesale .
optimistic government the bleak economic predictions were seen as another blow to the australian government which will hold a general election this year .
but if , as the surveys indicated , the economy begins to bottom out in june , the election could be held during an economic revival rather than during a period of economic worries .
mr howard believes the economic downturn seen in december was caused by one-off factors and insists the economy is in good shape .
" we 've now got a good financial position , our exports are growing , our consumer demand has been off the level of the last four years but -lsb- it is -rsb- still pretty solid and our interest rates are coming down , " he said .
stock markets fall the australian stock market 's s & p / asx 200 leading share index closed 1.7 % lower on tuesday at 3,264.7 .
" the market is just responding to more sentiment that the economy is slowing down faster than people expected , " said ing investment management 's geoff martin .
but mr martin remained fairly optimistic .
" it 's a difficult call because it 's quite possible that we 're already past the bottom in the economy , " he said .

the present procedures give too much latitude to the purveyors of lies and malice keith vaz however , its report criticised the minister for not answering " fully and promptly " questions from standards commissioner elizabeth filkin .
the committee 's report reveals that eight of the charges were not fully investigated because of problems getting evidence from mr vaz and other witnesses .

the committee recommended that no disciplinary action be taken against him .
mr vaz said he was delighted at the " complete rejection " of all but one of the allegations .
but in a statement on monday evening , the minister said he was surprised to be accused of obstructing the inquiry .
his office released a copy of a letter sent to mr vaz by ms filkin last year .
ms filkin : recommends further action the letter , dated 7 june , 2000 , states : " first may i record that mr vaz has been helpful in discussing these matters with me and in providing me with the right replies and information and you are correct in saying that mr vaz had already responded to all the allegations save one .

ahmed ressam has pleaded not guilty to nine terrorism-related charges after being arrested in december 1999 when trying to enter the united states from canada .
what if january last year had started with 1,000 americans dead ?
we came very close to having that happen richard clarke , former nsc official jury selection in the trial began on monday .
proceedings are expected to last several months .
the city of seattle cancelled its planned millennium celebrations after mr ressam was seized , afraid that its famed space needle could be a target for terrorists .
millennium plot prosecutors allege that mr ressam , 33 , was trying to smuggle explosives into the us in order to set off explosions during millennium celebrations .
his arrest led to the capture of a number of alleged co-conspirators , one of whom pleaded guilty last week to help a man known by a code name to enter the us from canada .
mr ressam was allegedly trained by mr bin laden the surprise guilty plea from abdelghani meskini , who was born in nigeria , may have implications for mr ressam .
but there has been confusion concerning mr meskini 's testimony .
last may , former us president bill clinton accused mr bin laden of being behind the plot .
a former national security council official said mr bin laden had planned to have his associates set off explosions in a number of different locations as the year 2000 dawned .
" what if january last year had started with 1,000 americans dead at six or seven locations around the world ?
we came very close to having that happen , " said richard clarke , the official .
second trial the ressam trial is the second ongoing court action against defendants allegedly linked with mr bin laden , who is believed to live in afghanistan .
police searched mr ressam 's apartment four men are on trial in new york , accused of bombing two us embassies in africa in 1998 .
mr ressam is suspected of having been trained in afghanistan by mr bin laden 's group .
he is already being tried in absentia in france in connection with a 1996 metro bombing , but us prosecutors are apparently making more effort than the french to connect mr ressam to the bin laden organisation .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- mbeki 's dilemma over zimbabwe low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : africa front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo tuesday , 13 march , 2001 , 08:22 gmt mbeki 's dilemma over zimbabwe mr mbeki has not publicly criticised mr mugabe by greg barrow in johannesburg when your next-door neighbour starts letting his house fall into ill repair , and makes trouble with his family , it is always difficult to know what to do .
this is the conundrum facing president thabo mbeki of south africa , when he looks northwards to his country 's neighbour , zimbabwe .
the difficulty for president mbeki is that the crisis in zimbabwe puts him in a tight spot to put it bluntly , zimbabwean president robert mugabe has been letting the neighbourhood down .
the crisis over his government 's bungled land-reform programme , violent political intimidation against the opposition , and economic collapse in zimbabwe are becoming infectious .
all of zimbabwe 's neighbours are suffering from the fall-out , which takes the form of plummeting confidence in a region which desperately needs to attract foreign investment .
as the economic and political power in the region , south africa might have been expected to intervene and force mr mugabe to clean up his act .
but president mbeki has refused to wield a big stick , preferring instead to champion what he calls " constructive engagement " with zimbabwe .
mr mbeki 's opponents call it " soft-shoe diplomacy " , and they say it is not working .
respect for elders the difficulty for president mbeki is that the crisis in zimbabwe puts him in a tight spot .
mr mbeki is still a relatively young head of state , and it would be seen as disrespectful for him to publicly criticise an elder statesmen , and former liberation leader such as president mugabe .
there is still an unstated pecking order amongst the leaders of southern africa , based on age , experience , and the role each played in liberating their countries from colonial rule .
the mdc has support from black and white people whatever his shortcomings as president of zimbabwe , mr mugabe is regarded by his counterparts as someone who is either close to , or at the very top of this pecking order , and he would not take kindly to being ticked off by a " youngster " like mr mbeki .
president mbeki is also aware that any political attack on president mugabe would not go down well among the rank and file of his supporters in the african national congress .
land reform is a popular issue among the poorer , mainly black section of society in south africa .
as these people make up the backbone of support for the african national congress , mr mbeki has to be very careful not to criticise a leader in a neighbouring country who appears to be doing more to help the rural black poor .
as in zimbabwe , the vast majority of fertile agricultural land in south africa is owned by white people .
the south african government has set up a legal framework to address the equitable redistribution of land but the process is slow and many black south africans are growing frustrated .
the voices of those who say that south africa should fast-track its land redistribution programme are growing louder , and they see the confiscation of white-owned farms in zimbabwe as an example of how things should be done in south africa .
race dilemma the polarisation of politics in zimbabwe into a black and white issue , where government policy appears to be aimed at wresting economic control away from the white minority , has widespread appeal in south africa .
most supporters of the african national congress sympathise with zimbabwe 's problems and the government 's attempts to iron out historical imbalances in access to wealth .
foreign investors become nervous when they see what appears to be south african appeasement in south africa , it is only the mainly white , opposition parties that have openly questioned and criticised the policies of president mugabe 's zanu pf party .
inevitably , these same opposition parties have formed the closest links with the opposition mdc , or movement for democratic change in zimbabwe .
when the mdc won an unprecedented 57 seats in last year 's parliamentary elections in zimbabwe , its leader morgan tsvangirai toured the region seeking support from political parties in neighbouring countries .
but when he knocked on the door of the african national congress , he was snubbed .
the anc leadership did not trust mr tsvangirai .
they resented the close links the mdc had formed with the mainly white opposition parties in south africa , and to a certain extent , anc leaders believed the propaganda from president mugabe , that the mdc is little more than a party of black stooges funded by white zimbabweans intent on re-introducing colonial rule .
world watches with no channels of communication between the african national congress and the movement for democratic change , president mbeki 's intelligence about the zimbabwean situation will be severely limited .
his government has decided to ignore the main opposition group almost entirely and this may explain the failure so far of his " constructive engagement " policy .
the anc leadership does not trust mr tsvangirai the past year has seen president mbeki juggling these domestic and regional concerns with the requirement that on the international stage he is required to talk tough on the subject of zimbabwe .
foreign investors become nervous when they see what appears to be south african appeasement towards zimbabwe .
south africa 's initial silence over last year 's land crisis in zimbabwe was a case in point .
to potential investors , this sent out a message that if it can happen in zimbabwe , it could also happen in south africa .
in response , mr mbeki was forced to declare publicly that there would be no illegal confiscation of white-owned farmland in south africa .
most observers would like him to go much further and declare that the government of president mugabe has embarked on a destructive and dictatorial course that will damage not only zimbabwe , but the region as a whole .
in the present political climate , that is unlikely to happen .
