he has strong support in east java , which has seen sporadic violence in recent months .
there are reports of some small demonstrations there .
there were two bomb attacks at churches in jakarta on sunday , which left 60 injured , but so far there have been no reports of violence or protests since the assembly 's impeachment sessions began .

the party 's ruling national executive committee -lrb- nec -rrb- - which meets on tuesday - is facing calls from unions for the setpiece autumn gathering to be allowed to debate the issue .
if tony blair is unable to convince his own party about the wisdom of his proposals , then what chance has he of convincing the public gmb spokesman the nec will also use the meeting to decide on a successor to outgoing labour party general secretary margaret mcdonagh .
prime minister tony blair has put the use of private money at the heart of efforts to reform and improve services including hospitals and schools .
but disquiet has been expressed from all sections of the party - including backbench mps and grassroots membership - and the conference could see the clash coming to a head whether or not labour chiefs allow it onto the official agenda .
a spokesman for the gmb union said that privatisation of public services was the number one issue facing the party and was too important to be " spun away . "
he added : " we need to have a full and open debate on the floor of the party conference to see if we can throw some light on the government 's privatisation proposals .
" if tony blair is unable to convince his own party about the wisdom of his proposals , then what chance has he of convincing the public . "
funding cut last week the gmb announced it was cutting up to Â£ 1m from its contributions to the labour party over the next four years in protest at the plans for greater involvement of private companies in public services .
the country 's biggest union , unison , urged the government to " face the facts " over privatisation of public services .
it claims there was growing evidence of failures in the system .
general secretary dave prentis said he could not understand the government 's " love affair " with the private sector .
" it is time that tony blair faced the facts and abandoned his privatisation mission . "
' travesty ' warning mark seddon , editor of the left-wing journal tribune and elected to the nec this year , said : " labour members across the country would think it a travesty if this was n't debated . "
mr seddon warned that if the annual conference failed to address the issue , " the trade unions would be forced to use other avenues outside the labour party " .
as well as the gmb move last week , unison voted at its conference last month to review links with labour .
meanwhile , labour has drawn up a shortlist of five contenders to replace the party 's outgoing controversial general secretary ms mcdonagh .
many in the party will hope for a general secretary with a lower profile than ms mcdonagh 's , who eventually became closely identified as a prime mover behind new labour 's alleged " control freakery " .

the country 's biggest union , unison , urged the government to " face the facts " over privatisation of public services .
it claims there was growing evidence of failures in the system .
general secretary dave prentis said he could not understand the government 's " love affair " with the private sector .
" it is time that tony blair faced the facts and abandoned his privatisation mission . "
' travesty ' warning mark seddon , editor of the left-wing journal tribune and elected to the nec this year , said : " labour members across the country would think it a travesty if this was n't debated . "
mr seddon warned that if the annual conference failed to address the issue , " the trade unions would be forced to use other avenues outside the labour party " .
as well as the gmb move last week , unison voted at its conference last month to review links with labour .
meanwhile , labour has drawn up a shortlist of five contenders to replace the party 's outgoing controversial general secretary ms mcdonagh .
many in the party will hope for a general secretary with a lower profile than ms mcdonagh 's , who eventually became closely identified as a prime mover behind new labour 's alleged " control freakery " .

the education secretary , estelle morris , announced details of a substantial increase in the availability of affordable childcare places for the under-fives .
this will include a Â£ 40m boost for pre-school education for three and four year olds in disadvantaged areas .
speaking on a visit to robert owen early years centre , the education secretary said that the government was making progress on childcare , but there was still much more to achieve .
but she asserted that in expanding pre-school education " this government has done more in four years than previous governments have done in forty " .
these extra places include those funded under the neighbourhood nurseries initiative , announced in december 2000 by the former education secretary , david blunkett .
this Â£ 300m childcare package will provide 45,000 extra places in 900 nursery centres , many of which will be located in disadvantaged areas .
a further Â£ 10m from the european social fund will fund the training of extra childcare workers .
meeting needs ms morris said there was a need for more integrated services that met the needs of parents and their children .
" i am announcing a number of childcare and early education measures that will make a major contribution to delivering quality services to families in disadvantaged areas , " ms morris said .
" this will help us meet our ambition that by march 2004 there should be a childcare place in the most disadvantaged areas for every lone parent entering employment .
" these new places will make a real difference to children 's lives and those of their parents in the most disadvantaged areas of the country , " she said .
targets the government has set a target of creating 1.6 million extra places in nurseries , playgroups and with childminders by 2004 .
in this year 's election manifesto , the government set itself a deadline of 2004 to provide a part-time place for every three year old - having previously achieved its aim of a place for every four year old .
this latest announcement was central to the government meeting its targets , ms morris said .
return to work widening access to childcare has been a consistent theme of this administration - seen as being a key to both improving educational standards and allowing more parents to return to work .
but it faced initial teething problems - with the closure of many small voluntary playgroups being attributed to the expansion of nursery classes in primary schools .
this meant that while thousands of new places were created , large numbers of places were also disappearing .
now the government is stressing that it has found the right balance and will deliver substantial increases and improvements in this sector .
but the liberal democrats claimed that this was a case of " recycling " news , saying that the government was seeking credit for money that had already been announced .

but not in israel .
the long-awaited reform of israel 's telecoms sector - which parliament is expected to consider this week - has been thrown into doubt by a row over the proliferation of pornography .
not for the first time , ultra-religious parties - traditionally a key constituent of israeli coalition governments - are attempting to extract their price for supporting legislation .
having opposed the legislation in preliminary votes , the ultra-orthodox jewish parties say they will only approve it if a provision is added banning cable tv operators from continuing to broadcast porn .
badly in need of overhaul the objections are a blow to proponents and supporters of the new bill , who say the israeli telecoms industry is badly in need of an overhaul .
" it 's the most important economics law that will have been passed in the last 10 to 20 years , " said haim israel , telecoms analyst at nessuah zannex securities .
" it 's going to open the telecoms market to free competition .
it will bring us closer to the western market . "

it controls fixed-line telecoms , is the country 's only broadband internet service provider and is the major owner of the biggest mobile phone operator .
reported compromise the new law would allow cable tv operators to offer broadband internet and phone services in direct competition with bezeq .
alongside introduction of competition , the government would sell down its 55 % stake in bezeq .
but to become law , the bill must be approved by parliament 's 15-member economics committee and , after that , by mps .
porn damages children as well as increasing sexual violence against women igal bibi national religious party the economics committee , which contains several ultra-religious politicians , last week failed to approve the bill , voting seven-seven with one abstention .
and this result came despite reports that a compromise had been reached under which cable tv subscribers would be required to use a special magnetic card to access " adult entertainment " channels .
the committee will now make a fresh attempt to reach a decision but the outcome remains uncertain .
some members appear to be implacably opposed but parliament watchers are familiar with the scenario of ultra-religious parties retreating at the last moment , if the price is right .
addicted igal bibi , member of both the national religious party and parliament 's economics committee , is one of those concerned that " a lot " of people are becoming addicted to pornography while children might also be exposed to pornographic images through cable tv .
" for children , it distorts the relationship to sex in their minds , " he said .

us and uk trade ministers are meeting in washington to try to avert possible us tariffs on steel imports and settle other outstanding differences .
but at the same time , ministers from the 49 least developed countries -lrb- ldcs -rrb- in the world are meeting in the island of zanzibar .
they are seeking a united front to ensure their needs are not crowded out by those of industrialised states at trade talks planned for later this year .
blocking tactics after the chaos in genoa , the target for talks is the world trade organisation 's meeting in doha , qatar , scheduled for this november .
patricia hewitt : hoping to smooth uk-us differences doha represents an attempt by the wto to restart the trade round , which was previously derailed by the protests in seattle in 1999 .
but even if the authorities in doha manage to keep protest to a minimum , the talks continue to face significant risks of breakdown .
since wto decisions need to proceed by consensus , the ldcs who are members could stall talks indefinitely if they agree to work as a bloc .
" i believe they have a strong case , " said rubens ricupero , secretary-general of the un conference on trade and development -lrb- unctad -rrb- .
" the ldcs ca n't make further concessions in terms of trade ; most have already liberalised under the structural adjustment programmes of the imf and the world bank .
" now it is time to recognise that they have some credit for liberalisation . "
barriers remain with the 49 least developed countries accounting for just 0.4 % of world exports , delegates said they want to ensure that market liberalisation favours their interests .
they also want developed countries to honour commitments that would open markets in industries like agriculture and textiles .
most ' least developed countries ' have already liberalised under the programmes of the imf and the world bank .
now it is time to recognise that they have some credit for it rubens ricupero , unctad secretary general ldc ministers have made it clear they do not oppose globalisation , just the current trajectory which , they say , is designed to favour the rich .
" the principle -lrb- of globalisation -rrb- is correct , " said idi simba , tanzania 's trade minister .
" in the long run , we are all going to gain provided everybody sticks to the rules .
but the rules are not yet kept . "
also on the agenda is the question of patents held by western drug companies on medicines needed for aids , malaria and tuberculosis , among other diseases .
delegates in zanzibar want their existing right to breach patents in the case of health emergencies strengthened .
the us in particular disapproves of further opt-outs on this issue .
washington talks the subject will almost certainly come up in the uk-us talks , the first between the bush administration and the new ministerial team following the uk 's general election in june .
new uk trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt and her trade minister , baroness symons , will try to quell the risk of us tariffs on steel imports , mooted by bush administration officials to help a troubled domestic steel industry .
they are also likely to discuss recent disagreements which have seen both sides launch punitive tariffs .
for the us , it was to push a european union reluctantly into dismantling its preferential system for banana imports from caribbean countries .
reports suggest the wto deal which in theory settled that argument is coming unstuck as the two sides disagree over the length of waivers before the preferences are removed .

the bank ran up pre-tax losses of Â£ 63.4m in the first half of the year compared to Â£ 80.7m in the same period a year ago .
it 's becoming less expensive to acquire customers paul gratton egg boss the results were better than expected , with analysts expecting a loss of Â£ 65-70m .
it said 370,000 net new customers were signed up during the six month period , a 19 % rise on the first half of the previous year .
egg says it is on target to break even at some point during the last three months of the year .
but chief executive paul gratton declined to comment on when the bank would enter a period of sustainable profitability .
cross-selling mr gratton said that the timeframe for making a sustainable profit was largely a factor of the bank 's decision on how fast the directors chose to grow the bank .
egg now has 1.7 million people using its financial services .
" we 're very pleased with the rate of customer growth , we 've acquired more customers than in any other period so far , and this is despite the fact that marketing efforts have decreased , " said mr gratton .
egg customers , 30 june 2001 credit card 1,125,982 personal loans 91,566 mortgages 22,496 egg invest 31,796 deposits 625,471 egg insure 15,534 total 1,720,881 the bank did not say how many customers have taken their banking away from egg during the first six months of the year .
credit cards remain the principal acquisition product .
and the bank notes that 89 % of customers kept their credit card account , even after the bargain offers designed to draw in customers had expired .
" this is even better than we thought , " said mr gratton , who also noted that it has become less expensive to acquire customers .
egg invest has also performed well , trebling in size since the start of the year to reach 32,000 customers .
mortgage blues but egg 's foray into the mortgage market has been less successful , with egg branded mortgage sales down to Â£ 164m compared with Â£ 318m the previous year .
mr gratton said it had decided not to compete aggressively in a highly competitive market , and would primarily market mortgages as part of its cross-selling strategy .
cross-selling - where each customer is encouraged to hold multiple egg products - is a key to egg 's strategy to reach profitability .
the ratio of cross selling has increased to 1.36 - in other words a third of customers hold another product , up from 1.09 last year .
the bank aims to achieve a ratio of 1.5 in the medium term .
international expansion the company said that its alliance with microsoft to distribute financial services was a first step towards establishing an international presence .
mr gratton highlighted france and germany as the key areas of interest for a future partnership , but also mentioned the potential of spain and italy .
the bank was partially floated by parent company prudential in june last year .
after slumping in late 2000 , its shares have outperformed the uk banking sector by about 40 % so far this year and risen by 36 % since january .
shares in egg were a 1p higher at 163p at 0945 in london -lrb- 0845 gmt -rrb- .
that is 3p above the float price .

it 's becoming less expensive to acquire customers paul gratton egg boss the results were better than expected , with analysts expecting a loss of Â£ 65-70m .
it said 370,000 net new customers were signed up during the six month period , a 19 % rise on the first half of the previous year .
egg says it is on target to break even at some point during the last three months of the year .
but chief executive paul gratton declined to comment on when the bank would enter a period of sustainable profitability .
cross-selling mr gratton said that the timeframe for making a sustainable profit was largely a factor of the bank 's decision on how fast the directors chose to grow the bank .
egg now has 1.7 million people using its financial services .
" we 're very pleased with the rate of customer growth , we 've acquired more customers than in any other period so far , and this is despite the fact that marketing efforts have decreased , " said mr gratton .
egg customers , 30 june 2001 credit card 1,125,982 personal loans 91,566 mortgages 22,496 egg invest 31,796 deposits 625,471 egg insure 15,534 total 1,720,881 the bank did not say how many customers have taken their banking away from egg during the first six months of the year .

and the bank notes that 89 % of customers kept their credit card account , even after the bargain offers designed to draw in customers had expired .
" this is even better than we thought , " said mr gratton , who also noted that it has become less expensive to acquire customers .
egg invest has also performed well , trebling in size since the start of the year to reach 32,000 customers .
mortgage blues but egg 's foray into the mortgage market has been less successful , with egg branded mortgage sales down to Â£ 164m compared with Â£ 318m the previous year .
mr gratton said it had decided not to compete aggressively in a highly competitive market , and would primarily market mortgages as part of its cross-selling strategy .
cross-selling - where each customer is encouraged to hold multiple egg products - is a key to egg 's strategy to reach profitability .
the ratio of cross selling has increased to 1.36 - in other words a third of customers hold another product , up from 1.09 last year .
the bank aims to achieve a ratio of 1.5 in the medium term .
international expansion the company said that its alliance with microsoft to distribute financial services was a first step towards establishing an international presence .
mr gratton highlighted france and germany as the key areas of interest for a future partnership , but also mentioned the potential of spain and italy .
the bank was partially floated by parent company prudential in june last year .
after slumping in late 2000 , its shares have outperformed the uk banking sector by about 40 % so far this year and risen by 36 % since january .
shares in egg were a 1p higher at 163p at 0945 in london -lrb- 0845 gmt -rrb- .
that is 3p above the float price .

welty , who was famous for her short stories and novels set mainly in mississippi , died on monday in hospital in her hometown of jackson , mississippi , us .
she had been suffering from pneumonia , a hospital spokeswoman said .
welty 's works included the ponder heart and losing battles .
she was praised by critics , fellow writers and musicians for her vivid imagery and shrewd dialogue , which brought the south to life .
she won the pulitzer prize in 1973 for her novel the optimist 's daughter .
a spokeswoman at the baptist medical center in jackson announced the novelist 's death .
" ms welty passed away at 1225 of cardio pulmonary arrest secondary to pneumonia , " she said .
depression born on 13 april , 1909 , welty grew up in jackson and had lived there almost permanently since 1931 .
she never married and once told the new york times in an interview that marriage " never came up " .
welty attended the mississippi state college for women before graduating from the university of wisconsin in 1929 .
she also studied advertising at the columbia university school of business .
welty 's interest in fiction writing began when she worked as a publicist for franklin d roosevelt 's works progress administration from 1933 to 1936 .
the job took her throughout mississippi to chronicle depression-era life with interviews and photographs of ordinary people .

two years later , she won acclaim for her first published collection of short stories , a curtain of green and other stories .

sentiment although welty did not belong to a southern " school " of writers , she had an ability to use regional sentiment as metaphor for universal human experience .
as such , she was often compared with william faulkner and katherine anne porter .
welty said fiction provided her with the most productive tool for analysing human personality .
her other works includethe bride of innisfallen , a collection of short stories .
the optimist 's daughter was a tale about the ordeal of a woman whose widowed father marries someone much younger than herself .
the acclaim it brought was seen as a fitting crown to welty 's long and vibrant literary career .
during that time , she also received the prestigious american book award for fiction .
two of her books , the ponder heart and the robber bridegroom , were also made in to broadway plays .
welty was also celebrated for her photography .

the chemicals , known as pbdes , are a by-product of high-tech industry .
they appear to be passing into the environment in rapidly increasing amounts .
fish in the baltic sea are becoming contaminated , and when they are eaten by humans the toxins are being passed on .
it is feared that unborn babies whose mothers eat the contaminated fish are most at risk .
the chemicals , which can be passed on in breast milk , are thought to affect brain development and hormonal balance .
better monitoring scientists at sweden 's karolinska institute have been monitoring the situation .
dr koidu noren said the amount of pbdes detected had been doubling every five years .
fish are being contaminated she said : " the children get these compounds in a very sensitive period of development .
it has been shown to be a toxic compound , so it should not be there . "
research has shown that very low doses of pbde given to baby mice , led to irreparable brain damage , causing reduced learning capacity and hyperactive behaviour .
dr michael warhurst , a safer chemicals campaigner for the pressure group friends of the earth , told bbc news online that women should not be put off breastfeeding , as it was the most effective way to provide babies with the nutrients they needed .
health warning he said little was yet known about the exact effect of pbdes on human health .
but he said : " these chemicals are clearly accumulating both in the environment and in our bodies .
we believe any chemical that does this should be phased out as a precautionary measure . "
dr warhurst said safer alternatives were available .
the swedish government has issued a health warning alerting people to the dangers of eating fish .
pbdes , or polybrominated diphenyl ethers , are a by-product of a flame retardant chemical used in electronic appliances .
they collect in the fatty tissue of the fish .

during their joint flight , the five atlantis astronauts and three space station crew installed a new $ 164 million air lock , bringing to an end the first assembly phase of space station construction .
we accomplished a lot of work and i think it 's primarily because these two crews came together as one crew .
shuttle commander steven lindsey during a farewell ceremony on board the iss , yuri usachev , the russian commander of the space station , presented each of the atlantis astronauts with a silver medal .
" thank you very much , and have a soft , safe landing , " ' he said .
the spacecraft parted company high above the north atlantic after the two crews posed for photographs and exchanged hugs .
astronaut jim voss sets the timer on his camera for a group shot " it 's hard for us to leave , " said shuttle commander steven lindsey .
" we accomplished a lot of work and i think it 's primarily because these two crews came together as one crew . "
the atlantis astronauts were due to land in florida early on tuesday , but the landing was delayed by nearly 24 hours because of bad weather in the vicinity of cape canaveral .
the installation of the new air lock marked an important step forward in the development of the iss .
before this , it had only been possible to carry out space walks by leaving the station through air-locks on the space shuttle docked beside it .
now , astronauts living on the space station will be able to work outside the craft even when a shuttle is not there .
airlock spec material - aluminium length - 5.5 metres diameter - 4 metres weight - 6,064 kilograms volume - 34 cubic metres cost - $ 164 million , including gas tanks us astronauts michael gernhardt and james reilly made use of the air lock for the first time on saturday as they floated out into space to hang a high-pressure gas tank on the side of the door .
three spacewalks were required to install the new ' front door ' or joint airlock module -lrb- jam -rrb- .
its universal fittings mean it will eventually be possible for both american and russian crew members to use it .
open house " once the airlock is installed , the hatches between a visiting space shuttle and the space station can remain open , " said mike hawes , nasa deputy associate administrator for the space station .
floating weightless in the new airlock " this is important because in previous missions we 've had to open and close the hatches several times to maintain correct pressure during spacewalks .
" now , we 'll be able to keep those doors open , providing greater efficiency during joint orbital activities . "
the jam , which measures four metres -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- across and 5.5 metres -lrb- 18 feet -rrb- in length , was anchored to the iss with the help of the station 's advanced canadarm2 , which was added to the platform in april . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's chris dobson " atlantis undocks to depart for the last stage of its journey " the bbc 's elaine parke " space is no longer the final frontier " nasa spokesman , kelly humphries " this basically gives them everything they have to have , to do their jobs on the station " click here for more news and analysis analysis importance politics purpose benefits background history components audio video space station takes shape see also : 14 jul 01 -pipe- science / nature atlantis docks with space station 12 jul 01 -pipe- americas security scare closes shuttle landing strip 22 apr 01 -pipe- science / nature shuttle astronauts armed and ready 14 mar 01 -pipe- science / nature space station crews change over 12 mar 01 -pipe- science / nature astronauts make shuttle history internet links : iss -lrb- nasa -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top science / nature stories now : date for first australians fifth closest star discovered mona lisa smile secrets revealed the gene that maketh man ?
