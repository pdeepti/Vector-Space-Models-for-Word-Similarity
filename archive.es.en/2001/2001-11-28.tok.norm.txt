government negotiator abraham iribani said that the rebels , who are surrounded in the city , would be permitted to leave the city for the neighbouring province of zamboanga del sur , as agreed during negotiations .
earlier on wednesday morning 23 hostages were released in two batches by the rebels , who are loyal to the outgoing renegade governor nur misuari .
it is still unclear whether the rebels are prepared to give up their arms , which the military has demanded , according to reuters news reports .
rebel leader julhambri misuari , nephew of the governor , told local radio station dzmm that it was still an ongoing discussion .
" that will be a subject of debate , " he said .
" the important thing is the hostages will be released . "
however the bbc 's jonathan head said that the rebels would be " very reluctant " to give up their guns .
violent uprising the rebels had earlier threatened to kill their captives , unless government forces gave them safe passage .
the hostages were taken by followers of outgoing renegade governor nur misuari as they fled from military air strikes against their base in a government complex .
mr misuari began an uprising last week , ahead of a vote to elect a new governor for the autonomous region in muslim mindanao -lrb- armm -rrb- .
more than 100 people died in attacks on army outposts by rebels supporting mr misuari on the island of jolo .
despite the violence , voting went ahead on monday amid tight security , and there were few reports of trouble .
but on tuesday morning , air force bombers and helicopters targeted the rebels - said to number about 100 - who had refused leave the office complex in a zamboanga suburb .
an army spokesman said 25 insurgents , a soldier , and at least one civilian were killed in the air strikes .
human shields as they tried to escape the bombardment , rebels snatched local residents from their homes , tied them up and used them as human shields and marched them through the city .
the rebels then took over a small public hall , from where they have been negotiating with the authorities .
the gunmen belong to the muslim separatist moro national liberation front -lrb- mnlf -rrb- - led by mr misuari until he was dropped by the group 's political leadership earlier this year .
the mnlf fought a long secessionist war , spanning three decades , until a peace agreement signed in 1996 set up the armm with mr misuari as governor .
the bbc 's john mclean in manila says the mnlf is sticking to the peace agreement , and mr misuari commands the loyalty of only a small faction .
our correspondent in zamboanga says mr misuari lost a lot of support due to his poor performance as governor .
allegations of incompetence and corruption led the philippines government to back alternative candidates within the mnlf .
after the failure of his uprising , mr misuari fled to malaysia , where he was arrested on saturday .

two israelis died and scores were injured when gunmen opened fire in the northern israeli town of afula , and an israeli woman died hours later when palestinian militants attacked a bus near a jewish settlement in the gaza strip .
this murderous terrorist act is the palestinian welcome for -lsb- us envoys -rsb- general zinni and assistant secretary of state william burns avi pazner israeli government spokesman on afula attack the killings came as the us envoys - anthony zinni and assistant secretary of state william burns - held talks with israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
they are due to meet the palestinian leadership on wednesday .
general zinni said the killings showed the importance of reaching a ceasefire .
in a statement , the palestinian authority said it " strongly condemns the two attacks ... which targeted israeli civilians , " while palestinian leader yasser arafat said the " plo will deploy a 100 percent effort to consolidate the ceasefire -lsb- with israel -rsb- " .
' pressure arafat ' the bbc 's kylie morris in jerusalem says that when the palestinian delegation meets the americans , it is expected to emphasise three points - an end to occupation , the establishment of a palestinian state and a freeze on israeli settlements .
israel , for its part , has called on the envoys to put pressure on mr arafat to crack down on palestinian militants .
" we do n't see a change in arafat 's strategy of violence and terror .
if you -lsb- us envoys -rsb- can successfully change his tactics , it would be a great accomplishment , " said a statement from israeli 's defence ministry .
the attack in afula took place as mr sharon took the envoys on a helicopter tour of the west bank to demonstrate israel 's security concerns .
the helicopter hovered over the scene of the shootings as ambulances took the wounded to hospital .
minutes earlier , two men opened fire in the centre of the town , spraying bullets into a bus station and a nearby market .
a bystander , mordechai cohen , told israel radio that " terrorists in civilian dress appeared and started to fire " .
" they shot the first person in the head .
he fell down , they ran toward the market . "
police shot and killed both attackers .
revenge palestinian militant groups islamic jihad and al-aqsa brigades said their members had carried out the attack in revenge for the killing of a leader of the military wing of the radical islamic hamas movement by israel last friday .
the gunmen came from a refugee camp in the palestinian-controlled town of jenin on the west bank , about 15 km -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- from afula .
the two attacks came hours after israeli troops pulled out of jenin , the last of six palestinian towns occupied by israeli forces following the assassination of an israeli minister last month .
a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry said the withdrawal was a gesture of goodwill to coincide with the arrival in israel of the us envoys .
their mission follows last week 's speech by the us secretary of state , colin powell , in which he spelled out washington 's vision for the middle east .
the united states has said general zinni will stay in the region for as long as it takes to bring an end to 14 months of fighting in which nearly 1,000 people - mainly palestinians - have been killed .

senior officials from the crown office have promised reform after a staff survey revealed high levels of discontent among workers .
it is also thought that high levels of stress may have contributed to cases which have been lost because of mistakes by prosecutors .
opposition parties have responded to the survey findings by calling for more resources to be allocated to scotland 's justice system .
stress is said to be common among some staff the crown office ordered the survey after several staff members complained of regular work-related stress .

it also showed that 10 % of staff are at high risk of mental or physical health problems and their energy levels are at 10 % below average .
the scottish national party says more resources must be allocated to overcome current difficulties in the service .

his comments come one year after the crown office published a plan setting out its key objectives for the future .
among these was a greater commitment to staff training which the plan said would require additional resources .

carried out by the auditor general , the first survey of welsh nhs buildings also found 1 % fell dangerously below health and safety standards .
a major effort is now needed to bring hospitals and other buildings up to standard sir john bourn , auditor general and , it concludes , up to £ 25m could be saved if managers were more effective at using hospitals and other nhs facilities - a fifth of the estate is under-used and 3 % lies empty .
but auditor general sir john bourn said while the management of buildings had been neglected , the dilpidation posed no risk to patients or staff .
the buildings referred to in the report as dangerously below standards were in fact disused .
' cause for concern ' the nhs in wales owns around 900 properties , worth around £ 1.2bn.
however , sir john is expected to tell the welsh assembly on wednesday that the state of nhs estate in wales is a " cause for concern " .
nhs trusts have argued £ 300m needs to be spent to bring old buildings up to scratch .
top of the areas needing attention , gwent nhs trust has said it needs £ 83m , while cardiff and vale has estimated £ 70m is required .
management neglected " managing the estate is a vital , and previously neglected aspect of running the nhs in wales , " said sir john .
" a major effort is now needed to bring hospitals and other buildings up to standard .
" and i would expect substantial savings to be made through making better use of all property assets . "
his team also found incomplete estate management guidance has been provided to trusts .
but the report did recognise that there is a more strategic approach on the way from the nhs directorate - assembly civil servants in charge of the health service .
and new management arrangements due in april 2002 satisfied the auditor that things should improve .
the report by sir john comes eight month after he spoke of his " serious concern " at the financial health of the nhs in wales , which he found was £ 5m in the red .
the assembly is now due to consider the report 's findings in cardiff on 24 january .

carried out by the auditor general , the first survey of welsh nhs buildings also found 1 % fell dangerously below health and safety standards .
a major effort is now needed to bring hospitals and other buildings up to standard sir john bourn , auditor general and , it concludes , up to £ 25m could be saved if managers were more effective at using hospitals and other nhs facilities - a fifth of the estate is under-used and 3 % lies empty .
but auditor general sir john bourn said while the management of buildings had been neglected , the dilpidation posed no risk to patients or staff .
the buildings referred to in the report as dangerously below standards were in fact disused .
' cause for concern ' the nhs in wales owns around 900 properties , worth around £ 1.2bn.
however , sir john is expected to tell the welsh assembly on wednesday that the state of nhs estate in wales is a " cause for concern " .
nhs trusts have argued £ 300m needs to be spent to bring old buildings up to scratch .
top of the areas needing attention , gwent nhs trust has said it needs £ 83m , while cardiff and vale has estimated £ 70m is required .
management neglected " managing the estate is a vital , and previously neglected aspect of running the nhs in wales , " said sir john .
" a major effort is now needed to bring hospitals and other buildings up to standard .
" and i would expect substantial savings to be made through making better use of all property assets . "
his team also found incomplete estate management guidance has been provided to trusts .
but the report did recognise that there is a more strategic approach on the way from the nhs directorate - assembly civil servants in charge of the health service .
and new management arrangements due in april 2002 satisfied the auditor that things should improve .
the report by sir john comes eight month after he spoke of his " serious concern " at the financial health of the nhs in wales , which he found was £ 5m in the red .
the assembly is now due to consider the report 's findings in cardiff on 24 january .

young , deaf people 's voices are finally being heard pat henry research co-ordinator pat henry , research co-ordinator of the university of ulster 's community youth work team and co-author of the report , said it was a landmark study .

for the bbc television series walking with beasts , the animators had to work from ancient bones to create living animals .
beasts chronicles the rise of the mammals and birds which filled the ecological niche left when the dinosaurs died out .
in an interview with the bbc world service programme go digital , mike milne , head of computer animation at uk special effects house framestore , said the fact that many of the creatures featured were mammals made things particularly tricky .
dinosaurs , because of their relatively rigid lizard-like skins and inexpressive faces , did not require as much detail to make them look convincing , he said .
by contrast , the faces and furry bodies of mammals are much more mobile - and therefore more difficult to render .
wobbly features the sheer variety of elements on a mammal 's face , such as wobbly eyelids , eyebrows , whiskers , jowls , noses and ears that twitch , makes the job of bringing them to life much harder .
the whole series stands or falls on the our ability to fool the viewer into thinking that they are looking at something real mike milne , framestore " all of those elements have to be animated , " he said .
" so , the number of animation controls the animators have to work with is vast compared with dinosaurs . "
before the animators got to work on a beast 's face , they had to create a plausible model of the entire animal .
a 30-centimetre -lrb- one foot -rrb- clay model was created using photographs of fossil bones as well as reconstructions of the beast created by other artists .
palaeontologists were also on hand to advise about the look of the creature .
while most palaeontologists agree about the general shape of some of these ancient beasts , there is still great debate about their individual markings and behaviour .
second skin once a clay model was finished , it was laser scanned to create a three-dimensional , digital still-life of the creature .
this digital skin is used to put flesh on the movements that animators create for a beast .
these movements are generated using a computerised skeleton developed from the same set of photographs and drawings of fossils used to create the clay model .
but bringing life to a computerised skeleton is no easy task .
" it has to be done by really experienced animators because the way that the bones move and walk and run is the character of the creature , " said mr milne .
the framestore animators faced particular problems when working out how the distant cousins of humans in the walking with beasts series should walk .
" how does an ape-man walk ? " asked mr milne .
" obviously , it has got to be a more advanced walk than an ape , but at the same time you must realise that it 's not fully human so it must retain some ape-like character . "
expert aid again palaeontologists proved invaluable .
studies of fossil hips and hip joints of proto-humans have shown just what forces the arrangement of bones could bear .
these suggest that instead of pushing from the ball of the foot like modern humans , our distant cousins swung their legs from the hip .
it is the sort of movement seen today in great apes such as orang utans .
armed with this knowledge , the animators could get the skeletons moving convincingly .
a repertoire of movements was created for each beast in the programme that could be stitched together to create entire behaviours .
the laser-scanned skin was superimposed on the skeleton to get a basic beast .
next skilled artists developed the markings and colourations for the skin of the beast .
because there is precious little evidence about the surface markings of these ancient creatures , mr milne said the artists chose colour schemes like those seen on contemporary animals with similar lifestyles .
" for the sabre-tooth cats , we 've gone for a colouration that is like a leopard , " he said .
" we felt that this would give immediately the shorthand for speed and strength that we wanted to get across . "
fooling the viewer finally , the creatures were superimposed on the backgrounds filmed on location for the series .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- digital beasts roar to life categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 28 november , 2001 , 07:54 gmt digital beasts roar to life aquatic beasts are a real challenge for animators bringing to life creatures which roamed the earth around 50 million years ago posed new problems for computer animators .
for the bbc television series walking with beasts , the animators had to work from ancient bones to create living animals .
beasts chronicles the rise of the mammals and birds which filled the ecological niche left when the dinosaurs died out .
in an interview with the bbc world service programme go digital , mike milne , head of computer animation at uk special effects house framestore , said the fact that many of the creatures featured were mammals made things particularly tricky .
dinosaurs , because of their relatively rigid lizard-like skins and inexpressive faces , did not require as much detail to make them look convincing , he said .
by contrast , the faces and furry bodies of mammals are much more mobile - and therefore more difficult to render .
wobbly features the sheer variety of elements on a mammal 's face , such as wobbly eyelids , eyebrows , whiskers , jowls , noses and ears that twitch , makes the job of bringing them to life much harder .
the whole series stands or falls on the our ability to fool the viewer into thinking that they are looking at something real mike milne , framestore " all of those elements have to be animated , " he said .
" so , the number of animation controls the animators have to work with is vast compared with dinosaurs . "
before the animators got to work on a beast 's face , they had to create a plausible model of the entire animal .
a 30-centimetre -lrb- one foot -rrb- clay model was created using photographs of fossil bones as well as reconstructions of the beast created by other artists .
palaeontologists were also on hand to advise about the look of the creature .
while most palaeontologists agree about the general shape of some of these ancient beasts , there is still great debate about their individual markings and behaviour .
second skin once a clay model was finished , it was laser scanned to create a three-dimensional , digital still-life of the creature .
this digital skin is used to put flesh on the movements that animators create for a beast .
different creatures need different techniques to bring them to life these movements are generated using a computerised skeleton developed from the same set of photographs and drawings of fossils used to create the clay model .
but bringing life to a computerised skeleton is no easy task .
" it has to be done by really experienced animators because the way that the bones move and walk and run is the character of the creature , " said mr milne .
the framestore animators faced particular problems when working out how the distant cousins of humans in the walking with beasts series should walk .
" how does an ape-man walk ? " asked mr milne .
" obviously , it has got to be a more advanced walk than an ape , but at the same time you must realise that it 's not fully human so it must retain some ape-like character . "
expert aid again palaeontologists proved invaluable .
studies of fossil hips and hip joints of proto-humans have shown just what forces the arrangement of bones could bear .
these suggest that instead of pushing from the ball of the foot like modern humans , our distant cousins swung their legs from the hip .
it is the sort of movement seen today in great apes such as orang utans .
the series mixes live action and animation armed with this knowledge , the animators could get the skeletons moving convincingly .
a repertoire of movements was created for each beast in the programme that could be stitched together to create entire behaviours .
the laser-scanned skin was superimposed on the skeleton to get a basic beast .
next skilled artists developed the markings and colourations for the skin of the beast .
because there is precious little evidence about the surface markings of these ancient creatures , mr milne said the artists chose colour schemes like those seen on contemporary animals with similar lifestyles .
" for the sabre-tooth cats , we 've gone for a colouration that is like a leopard , " he said .
" we felt that this would give immediately the shorthand for speed and strength that we wanted to get across . "
fooling the viewer finally , the creatures were superimposed on the backgrounds filmed on location for the series .
for every real world sequence , images were taken of how the ambient light of that scene illuminated a sample object with a known reflective quality .
in framestore 's case this was a volleyball .
mike milne : up to viewer to decide an analogue of the volleyball was created on computer and the animators tried to match the light falling on this in the virtual world with what was captured during the real-life shoot .
this was then applied to the animated creature along with shadows and other shading effects to bring the beasts to life .
the final judge is the viewer .
" the whole series stands or falls on our ability to fool the viewer into thinking that they are looking at something real , " said mr milne .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- australia boat children inquiry categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : asia-pacific front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 28 november , 2001 , 07:58 gmt australia boat children inquiry some child refugees have no family with them australia 's human rights commission has launched a major investigation into the conditions of hundreds of children held in refugee detention centres .
the move follows complaints from detainees and human rights groups that children are being roughly treated by guards and denied schooling .
we can not steal their childhood away from them .
i really believe detention is bad for children human rights commissioner sev ozdowski more than 500 children are currently being detained , mostly in remote areas - and about 50 have no family members with them .
the head of the commission , sev ozdowski , said he would examine whether australia was breaching its international obligations on the rights of children .
" the only power i have is to shame the government , to report publicly , " he said .
mr ozdowski said there had been claims that unaccompanied children as young as eight were being interned along with adults in detention centres .
some of the children have been in custody for more than a year .
allegations human rights groups have repeatedly criticised the australian government for its policy of detaining all asylum-seekers until their applications for refugee status are processed .
" we can not steal their childhood away from them , " said mr ozdowski .
" i really believe detention is bad for children . "
to release the children would encourage others , says australia he said there had been a stream of unsubstantiated allegations that excessive force had been used on children during riots at detention centres .
many of the unaccompanied youngsters are 16 and 17-year-old males from afghanistan 's hazara minority who fled their homeland to escape taleban persecution .
australia 's ruling conservative coalition government was re-elected on 10 november after voters supported its blanket refusal to allow boat people to claim asylum .
co-operation more than 9,000 illegal immigrants , mostly from the middle east or afghanistan , have arrived in australia in the past two years , largely by boat via indonesia .
the investigation coincides with talks in canberra between indonesian foreign minister hassan wirayuda and his australian counterpart alexander downer on a joint approach to combating people-smuggling .
australian immigration minister philip ruddock said the government would co-operate with the inquiry but said it was unlikely to cover new ground , with four inquiries already held into immigration detention centres in the past 18 months .
refugees are now being taken to islands in the south pacific " the issues that will be addressed wo n't be new ones , but there will be people who have a particular view and are n't satisfied with the response that has been taken , who will want to press those issues again , " he told australia 's abc radio .
mr ruddock said that by releasing the children , asylum seekers might be encouraged to send children to australia alone in an attempt to gain entry later themselves .
the inquiry will measure the federal government 's stance against the requirements of the international convention on the rights of the child , which australia has agreed to apply to all those aged under 18 .
the convention states that detention should only be used as a last resort and only for the shortest possible time .
it also urges that children be kept with family members .
mr ozdowski hopes to complete his report by the end of 2002 .

the groups , including the rspb , english nature and the council for national parks , are concerned valuable wildlife habitats will be destroyed if the proposed hampshire " super-port " gets the go-ahead .
associated british ports -lrb- abp -rrb- wants to build on a 202-hectare site at dibden bay on southampton water near the new forest .
the site is within the boundary of the new forest national park .
commercial organisations including esso and white horse ferries are also expected to make statements on wednesday .
this mad-cap plan has gone to public inquiry where the massive damage caused by the port , and local objections , will be carefully scrutinised tony juniper , friends of the earth many local residents are opposed to the proposals and environmental group friends of the earth is leading protests against the scheme .
tony juniper , director designate of the organisation , said : " this proposed port is unnecessary , unpopular and will cause enormous damage to one of the most sensitive and supposedly protected areas in the uk .
" it is astonishing that such a well-known corporation as associated british ports is seriously proposing it . "
he added : " at least this mad-cap plan has gone to public inquiry where the massive damage caused by the port , and local objections , will be carefully scrutinised . "
english nature , the government 's wildlife advisory group , says the super-port will have a detrimental effect on birds such as brent geese , oystercatchers , ringed and grey plover , curlew , lapwing and teal .
among the sites that it has argued should not be harmed include : solent maritime region , a candidate for special area conservation -lrb- sac -rrb- status and includes the hamble estuary ; solent and southampton water special protection area ; the river itchen , a candidate for sac status .
richard leafe , of english nature , said it objected to the impact the terminal construction scheme was likely to have .
he said : " we would like the inquiry inspectors to fully recognise the harm this development is likely to cause . "

the information exchange agreement will enable tax officers to break the bank secrecy laws in the cayman islands , a british colony long considered a haven for tax evaders and money launderers .
the governor of the islands , peter smith , said the colony wanted to be viewed throughout the world as a financial centre that adheres to international standards .
the united states estimates it loses $ 70bn a year in tax relating to deposits in offshore accounts .
a us attorney , robert morgenthau , told the senate earlier this year that the 600 banks licensed in the cayman islands had in their accounts twice as much money as all the new york city banks combined .
