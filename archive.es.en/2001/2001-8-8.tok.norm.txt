we are a normal aid organisation , not a christian organisation .
it is not our goal to proselytise sni spokesman , joachim jaeger but a new decree that includes a ban on trying to convert afghans also reportedly includes the provision that foreigners will not face the death penalty for missionary activity .
initial reports said that eight foreign aid workers - four germans , two australians , two americans - - could be executed if found guilty of trying to convert muslims .
sixteen afghan aid workers arrested at the same time still may face execution .
the bbc 's kate clark says no-one has yet seen the new evidence , which follows a display of seized items on tuesday , but it is likely to be used to enforce the taleban 's case against the group .
their charity , the german-based shelter now international -lrb- sni -rrb- has said the material was only for personal use .
sni spokesman , joachim jaeger , said : " we are a normal aid organisation , not a christian organisation .
it is not our goal to proselytise . "
us , german and australian diplomats are hoping to fly to kabul to argue for their release on thursday .
and they will be acutely aware of the severity of their people 's situation .
why would sni need to print bibles and have all of these video and audio tapes in local languages ?
mohammad salim haqqani , deputy minister for the prevention of vice our correspondent says the aid workers are being held by the taleban 's religious police - the most feared organisation within the taleban .
even other taleban ministers do not have any influence over them .
stuart worsley , who has worked in afghanistan for the last seven years for the agency care international , told the bbc : " it is an extremely difficult task .
" the taleban do not respond well to international pressure where they feel that pressure is challenging their national sovereignty and their independence to act within the country . "
christian ' front ' shelter now describes itself as a non-governmental organisation involved in food distribution , water supplies and helping street children .
the taleban , however , say the group 's activities are a front for propagating christianity .
mohammad salim haqqani , deputy minister for the prevention of vice and promotion of virtue , told reuters : " the probing is becoming interesting and all these new findings are indicative of the fact once again that they were deviating afghans .
" why would sni need to print bibles and have all of these video and audio tapes in local languages ?
" -lrb- the foreign staff -rrb- ca n't say they were kept for their own use as they only speak english and other foreign languages . "
but one of the group 's afghan workers , faraz khan , told our correspondent no foreign staff had encouraged him to convert in the 20 years he has been with the organisation .
tough line the taleban militia , which controls 95 % of the country , follows a purist form of islam and takes a hard line towards minority religions in afghanistan .
in january , the taleban 's supreme leader , mullah mohammad omar , decreed that anyone convicted of trying to persuade an afghan muslim to convert would face the death penalty .
taleban crime and punishment murder : execution thieves : limbs amputated adulterers : stoned or lashed to death but a report by the private afghan islamic press - which has close ties with the taleban - quoted an unspecified information ministry statement saying foreigners found guilty of such crimes could be jailed for three days to a month or expelled from the country .
' foreign masters ' in a sign of the taleban 's continuing hard line on " foreign influence " , four men convicted of setting off bombs in the afghanistan capital , kabul , were publicly hanged from steel cranes next to the city 's presidential palace on wednesday .
the taleban bakhtar news agency called the bombers " the puppets of foreign masters " .
our correspondent says there are fears that the arrests of the aid workers could lead to all international aid agencies , except specifically muslim ones , being branded as covert missionaries .
working in afghanistan is already very difficult .
earlier this year the united nations complained about arrests of local staff by the taleban 's religious police , raids on hospitals , and threats made against expatriate workers by foreign islamic militants who were allied to the taleban .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- taleban ' have proof ' against aid workers categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : south asia front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 8 august , 2001 , 06:08 gmt 07:08 uk taleban ' have proof ' against aid workers a bible is among items displayed by the taleban afghanistan 's ruling taleban say they have recovered thousands of christian video and audio tapes , and bibles translated into local languages , from 24 aid workers being held on charges of promoting christianity .
we are a normal aid organisation , not a christian organisation .
it is not our goal to proselytise sni spokesman , joachim jaeger but a new decree that includes a ban on trying to convert afghans also reportedly includes the provision that foreigners will not face the death penalty for missionary activity .
initial reports said that eight foreign aid workers - four germans , two australians , two americans - - could be executed if found guilty of trying to convert muslims .
sixteen afghan aid workers arrested at the same time still may face execution .
the bbc 's kate clark says no-one has yet seen the new evidence , which follows a display of seized items on tuesday , but it is likely to be used to enforce the taleban 's case against the group .
their charity , the german-based shelter now international -lrb- sni -rrb- has said the material was only for personal use .
sni spokesman , joachim jaeger , said : " we are a normal aid organisation , not a christian organisation .
it is not our goal to proselytise . "
us , german and australian diplomats are hoping to fly to kabul to argue for their release on thursday .
and they will be acutely aware of the severity of their people 's situation .
why would sni need to print bibles and have all of these video and audio tapes in local languages ?
mohammad salim haqqani , deputy minister for the prevention of vice our correspondent says the aid workers are being held by the taleban 's religious police - the most feared organisation within the taleban .
even other taleban ministers do not have any influence over them .
stuart worsley , who has worked in afghanistan for the last seven years for the agency care international , told the bbc : " it is an extremely difficult task .
" the taleban do not respond well to international pressure where they feel that pressure is challenging their national sovereignty and their independence to act within the country . "
christian ' front ' shelter now describes itself as a non-governmental organisation involved in food distribution , water supplies and helping street children .
the taleban , however , say the group 's activities are a front for propagating christianity .
aid workers are fighting a desperate level of need mohammad salim haqqani , deputy minister for the prevention of vice and promotion of virtue , told reuters : " the probing is becoming interesting and all these new findings are indicative of the fact once again that they were deviating afghans .
" why would sni need to print bibles and have all of these video and audio tapes in local languages ?
" -lrb- the foreign staff -rrb- ca n't say they were kept for their own use as they only speak english and other foreign languages . "
but one of the group 's afghan workers , faraz khan , told our correspondent no foreign staff had encouraged him to convert in the 20 years he has been with the organisation .
tough line the taleban militia , which controls 95 % of the country , follows a purist form of islam and takes a hard line towards minority religions in afghanistan .
in january , the taleban 's supreme leader , mullah mohammad omar , decreed that anyone convicted of trying to persuade an afghan muslim to convert would face the death penalty .
taleban crime and punishment murder : execution thieves : limbs amputated adulterers : stoned or lashed to death but a report by the private afghan islamic press - which has close ties with the taleban - quoted an unspecified information ministry statement saying foreigners found guilty of such crimes could be jailed for three days to a month or expelled from the country .
' foreign masters ' in a sign of the taleban 's continuing hard line on " foreign influence " , four men convicted of setting off bombs in the afghanistan capital , kabul , were publicly hanged from steel cranes next to the city 's presidential palace on wednesday .
the taleban bakhtar news agency called the bombers " the puppets of foreign masters " .
our correspondent says there are fears that the arrests of the aid workers could lead to all international aid agencies , except specifically muslim ones , being branded as covert missionaries .
working in afghanistan is already very difficult .
earlier this year the united nations complained about arrests of local staff by the taleban 's religious police , raids on hospitals , and threats made against expatriate workers by foreign islamic militants who were allied to the taleban .
but aid workers stay because of the desperate level of need in the country .

president andres pastrana announced the talks freeze on tuesday , saying the rebels had raised new demands and rejected government proposals .
the eln has not yet reacted to mr pastrana 's speech , but such actions by the government in the past have been met with mass kidnappings , attacks against oil and electrical and road blockades by rebels .
unofficial talks had been taking place in neighbouring venezuela between representatives of the government and the eln , colombia 's second largest rebel force .
security alert interior minister armando estrada said security measures were being intensified to ensure that the violence does not escalate .
mr pastrana had promised to end the 37-year old guerrilla war before leaving office next year .
i thought it was still possible to find a way out and not close the process definitively maria emma mejia , mediator since 1998 , the government has also been trying to persuade the larger revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- to lay down their weapons , but correspondents say there has been little progress .
more than 40,000 people , mainly civilians , have lost their lives in the past decade alone .
mr pastrana made his announcement in a surprise , strongly-worded televised address to the nation on tuesday .
he called the eln rebels " obstinate " and unwilling to " advance towards a peace process " .
correspondents say the eln has recently suffered losses on the battlefield , raising hopes that it would be more willing to reach a peace deal .
the government had offered to cede a demilitarised zone to the eln , as it has done with the farc , but it seems the rebels were not satisfied .
formal peace talks taking place in europe had also been suggested .
political benefit eln commander antonio garcia said last week that the president was using the negotiations for his own political benefit .
a peace mediator has called the announcement " unfortunate " .
former foreign minister maria emma mejia said : " i thought it was still possible to find a way out and not close the process definitively . "
