the plunder charge stems from allegations that mr estrada used his official position and influence to amass more than $ 80m in illegal wealth during his 31 months in office .
mr estrada , who was ousted in january amid mass street protests , is also charged with illegal use of an alias by taking an assumed name to hide his wealth .
and in a separate trial process , he is also accused of perjury .
the former movie star has denied all the charges , saying they are politically motivated .
death penalty the plunder charge , defined as large-scale corruption , is punishable by death under a tough justice law that took effect in 1994 .
mr estrada approved the execution of seven death row convicts under the code in 1999 .
however , analysts say it is unlikely the death penalty would be used for mr estrada .
his successor gloria arroyo has said she does not oppose the death penalty being law , but justice secretary hernando perez has ruled out any executions taking place while she is in power .
mr estrada was arraigned for perjury on 27 june , but refused to enter a plea .
the court automatically entered a plea of " not guilty " .
he is accused of falsifying the extent of his assets in official papers .
earlier charges against him were dropped so that prosecutors could concentrate on the plunder charge .
the charges dropped include the allegations against mr estrada which sparked his impeachment trial - that he received bribes from illegal gambling syndicates and kept millions of pesos in excise taxes .
set-back however , the prosecution may be hampered by a court decision that limits investigators ' access to private bank records .
in june the supreme court ruled that prosecutor aniano desierto has no authority to look into such records while investigating a graft complaint .
he can only access them once a case has been filed in a court that then provides authorisation .
the ruling provided exceptions , but none appears to apply to mr estrada 's cases .
the ruling was issued in a case unconnected to mr estrada 's charges , but could be used by mr estrada 's lawyers to block the opening of the former president 's private bank accounts .

hundreds of people marched through the streets of the chilean capital in protest at the court judgment suspending the test case against the former military ruler .

calling the general " our liberator " , one woman said legal action should never have been started in the first place .
the court of appeal 's decision makes it very difficult for any future case to be brought against the general .
he has been pronounced mentally incapable of conducting his own defence .
while technically the case is merely postponed until his condition improves , his worsening state of health means this is unlikely ever to happen .
fragile health the former leader 's supporters maintain that justice has been done .
the director of the pinochet foundation , general luis cortez , says that general pinochet can now live his last days in " peace and dignity " as he believes a former president should be able to .
but for the relatives of the 3,000 people who were killed or disappeared under the military regime during the 1970s and 80s , this comes as a devastating blow .
fabiola letelier 's brother was assassinated by the authorities .
she describes the court ruling as " a national shame " .
pinochet opponents deny his health is fragile .
however the 85-year-old suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure , and has spent the last year in and out of hospital .
last week he was admitted for a mouth operation , and ended up staying in for six days .
rumours that he had actually died had been circulating santiago .

patricia hewitt , trade and industry secretary , is expected to follow advice that the deal would harm competition on the high street .
the combined company would have controlled about a quarter of current accounts in the uk .
the decision , when it comes , will delight unions , which believe the deal would cost significantly more than the 9,000 jobs lloyds has estimated .
it will also offer consolation to abbey directors , who have fought the takeover .
but it would not secure abbey 's future as an independent bank , city analysts believe .
national australia bank is said to be interested in entering a bid , after selling national michigan bank in march for a profit of 1.6bn australian dollars .
" nab is sitting on a cash pile , and could well be looking to spend it on boosting its uk operations , " a leading city banking analyst told bbc news online .
nab , australia 's largest bank and owner of uk banks the clydesdale and yorkshire banks , has declined to comment on the rumours .
watchdogs ' report ms hewitt has been advised to block the lloyds / abbey merger by trade watchdogs at the competition commission , who a month ago finalised a four-month probe into the deal , according to weekend press reports .
her decision also follows an investigation into the banking sector by don cruickshank , chairman of the london stock exchange , which warned that major uk banks have a have a monopoly in the small business market , restricting price competition for customers .
the report raised widespread concerns over the wisdom of allowing further consolidation among major uk banks .
major blow refusal would come as a major blow to lloyds tsb , which while a profitable operation , has been thwarted in efforts to find a partner , and create a platform for future growth .
the bank estimated it could save annual costs of almost £ 1bn through the abbey merger .
but the combined group would have boasted at least 27 % of uk current accounts , a total which many observers said raised concerns of market domination .
lloyds may now seek a continental partner , or look to take over one of the smaller independent uk banks , a city analyst told bbc news online .
" the problem with a continental deal is that banks on the continent are generally far less profitable , so a merger might be difficult for lloyds shareholders to swallow .
" the problem with a uk merger is that many of the remaining independent banks , such as alliance & leicester , are in fact demutualised building societies , subject to protection from hostile takeovers .
" thus any merger would have to be agreed on a friendly basis , which may prove difficult to achieve . "
the move would , however , allow lloyds to build on its £ 1.8bn purchase of cheltenham & gloucester in 1994 , and develop its mortgage business .

" the problem with a continental deal is that banks on the continent are generally far less profitable , so a merger might be difficult for lloyds shareholders to swallow .
" the problem with a uk merger is that many of the remaining independent banks , such as alliance & leicester , are in fact demutualised building societies , subject to protection from hostile takeovers .
" thus any merger would have to be agreed on a friendly basis , which may prove difficult to achieve . "
the move would , however , allow lloyds to build on its £ 1.8bn purchase of cheltenham & gloucester in 1994 , and develop its mortgage business .

the company has said it would be capable of containing waste that has to stay on the site for more than 100 years .
but the council for national parks has said there should be a public inquiry as the scheme is of national importance .
this is the second time that bnfl has applied for permission to build a store for intermediate level waste at the plant .
in1998 an application was called in by the then welsh secretary ron davies .
the company wanted to store this particular type of nuclear waste in modified existing buildings at the site .
concerns but the plans were halted after nuclear inspectors voiced concerns about the detail of the proposals .
bnfl has said that the new proposals address that problems which were raised by the inspectors .
the company plans to build a store capable of holding the waste until radioactivity levels have fallen low enough to be handled without the need for sophisticated protection .
that could be as long as 135 years .
local anti-nuclear campaigners are to meet soon to discuss the plan .
trawsfynydd was taken out of commission in 1993 , with the last of the spent fuel being removed from the site two years later .

calum macdonald , member for the western isles , and a long-time campaigner for reform , said he became worried something has gone wrong with the proposed legislation on community ownership when the law society said it is unworkable .
and a leading reformist , dr jim hunter , has warned it could actually be counter-productive .
if necessary , he said , legislation on access should be completed separately .
in february , the scottish executive unveiled the draft bill , which proposed to give ramblers greater access and freedom of movement in rural areas .
calum macdonald : worried access part of the bill will be delayed it also aims to give smaller communities and crofters a legal right to buy the land they work and depend on for a living .
mr macdonald said of the bill : " the fact there are shortcomings at the moment , and quite big shortcomings , does n't discourage me .
" mainly because i think that these can be sorted out , in terms of extending community ownership .
mixed response to proposals " the thing that worries me more is that the other part of the bill that has to do with access to the right to roam seems more subject to disagreements .
" and i 'm worried that the land reform aspect of the bill will get delayed . "
the bill had been welcomed by scottish national heritage but ramblers and landowners representatives say they are disappointed with the content and are set to campaign for changes during the consultation period .
they criticised it for failing to address key issues and vowed to campaign on aspects which they thought should be included for discussion .
unveiling the bill , justice minister jim wallace described it as a " significant milestone in the executive 's land reform programme " .
