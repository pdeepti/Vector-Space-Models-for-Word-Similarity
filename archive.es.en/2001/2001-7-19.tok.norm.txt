timothy woodland , a 24-year-old staff sergeant stationed at kadena air base on the island , allegedly raped an okinawan woman in her 20s in a car park near the airbase in the early hours of 29 june .
mr woodland has maintained his innocence throughout , claiming the sex was consensual .
the case has fuelled local resentment of the huge us military presence .
mr woodland 's indictment came after the naha district court said prosecutors could not detain him beyond thursday , withdrawing a previous decision allowing detention until monday of next week .
prosecutors originally had until 23 july to charge mr woodland , but naha district court on wednesday moved that deadline up to thursday , choko zukeran , a spokesman for the prosecutors office said .
the deadline was reportedly changed after the court determined prosecutors had gathered enough evidence to charge him .
pressuring witnesses the move to indict comes on the heels of a reported push by mr woodland 's lawyer , tsuyoshi arakaki , to get him released , arguing that the suspect 's passport was held by the us military and he was unlikely to flee .
judge misao shimizu , however , said the court was concerned that , if released , mr woodland would meet us military personnel who had witnessed the alleged crime and ask them not to testify against him .
the alleged rape took place in a car park us officials refused to hand mr woodland over to local police for four days after an arrest warrant was issued on 2 july , saying they wanted guarantees that his rights would be protected .
many japanese took the delay as an insult to the nation 's justice system .
mr woodland was finally handed over on 6 july after us and japanese negotiators worked out a handover agreement .
the americans have not released details , but japanese news reports said prosecutors agreed to limit questioning of mr woodland to 10 hours a day and to move quickly on the case .
foot dragging when mr woodland was handed over he became only the second us serviceman to be given up to japanese investigators before formal charges had been filed .
japanese perceptions that washington had dragged its feet before handing mr woodland over revived calls to revise a pact on the status of us military forces in japan .
under the status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , washington need not hand over suspects until they are charged , but has agreed to consider making exceptions for " heinous " crimes .
residents of okinawa , which has about 26,000 us service people stationed there , have been outraged by repeated crimes involving us soldiers , including the gang rape of a 12-year-old girl in 1995 .

the cable television firm made an unsolicited $ 58bn bid for at & t 's broadband arm earlier this month .
at & t said that the bid " did not reflect the full value " of the unit and also expressed concern over the high proportion of voting power that comcast would command .
if the merger had gone ahead , it would have created the world 's largest broadband company with 22 million subscribers .
but the surprise offer has caused at & t to rethink its plans to spin off its broadband arm and it will now examine other alternatives for the division .
end of at & t ?
the planned spin-off was part of a radical restructuring of at & t to split the firm into three separate divisions .
some wall street analysts believed that the break-up of at & t would lead to a series of takeovers and the demise of the at & t brand .
" the big question since at & t announced -lsb- its -rsb- break-up was which unit was going to be the first to be acquired , " said jeffrey kagan , an independent telecoms analyst .
" at & t will cease to exist a year or two from now .
all the pieces will be gobbled up and the at & t brand name will be a nostalgic memory in the history of america business . "
the company now says that it will " explore financial and strategic alternatives relating to at & t broadband , including the previously announced restructuring plans " .
at & t broadband , already the sector leader in the us , includes cable operations and joint ventures such as the high-speed internet unit excite @ home .
comcast disappointment comcast expressed its disappointment that its offer had been rejected .
" we disagree with at & t board 's characterisation of our offer as inadequate , " said the cable firm in a statement .
the statement went on to point out that shareholders had welcomed the proposal and that over $ 14bn has been added to the market valuation of at & t since the offer was made .
comcast also indicated that it is prepared to continue talking to at & t , but has not yet shown any signs of raising its bid .

memorabilia the pub is decorated with various items of memorabilia including a picture of parkinson 's favourite footballer george best , which was given to him by elton john , and a caricature of parkinson senior .
" i 'll be leaving all the hard work up to nick , " said parkinson .
" he 's always wanted to own his own place too and we 've been looking for somewhere for ages .
" then we saw this place , and although it was in a terrible state it had potential and it is just down the road from where i live , so we decided to go for it . "

egypt 's stock market , once the apple of the intrepid middle east investor 's eye , has slumped to levels not seen for more than seven years .
while foreign investment has retreated to less risky markets in the face of global economic slowdown , local investors are hoping that the depressed air in cairo will lift when they return to work after summer holidays .
foreign investors have deserted the cairo stock exchange but a combination of local , regional and international factors is making the case for a rebound increasingly hard to make .
milestone five years ago , it all looked rather different .
after several years of slow progress with a privatisation programme that promised the sell-off of 314 state-owned companies , the egyptian government finally gave investors what they wanted - a majority stake in a company heading for the stock market .
egyptian stock market , 2000 turnover : 54bn egyptian pounds market capitalisation : 120bn egyptian pounds -lrb- 35 % of gdp -rrb- number of listed companies : 1,076 number of traded companies : 659 number of actively traded companies : about 100 source : capital markets authority $ 1 = 3.9 egyptian pounds the sale of shares in nasr city housing - an unglamorous company , you might think - proved to be a milestone .

the number of cairo brokerages climbed into the hundreds and international banks such as hsbc , abn amro and flemings stepped up their presence in one of the region 's few markets with a realistic claim on foreign investor attention .
shortly after , in february 1997 , the benchmark hermes index cleared 16,500 to reach what remains an all-time high .
telecoms frenzy but since then , performance has mostly disappointed , with only a few spurts of excitement along the way .
the flow of initial public offerings dried up and investors grew disillusioned with a government that promised much but delivered little .
the bright spots came largely from the greater numbers of private companies making their way to the market .
mobile phone operator mobinil in early 1999 became the first telecoms firm to list , immediately generating a frenzy of activity .
in months , the company 's shares had more than quadrupled in value , giving an impressive boost to overall market value and turnover .
but the effect was to disguise stagnation in the wider market .
despite this , the market ended the year on a positive note , following the appointment of atef obeid , former privatisation minister , at the head of a new government .
misplaced several analysts confidently identified egypt as an emerging market star for 2000 , awaiting the huge planned flotation of state phone firm telecom egypt .
the optimism soon proved misplaced .
mobinil , which accounted for about 35 % of the bourse 's value , plunged taking the rest of the market with it as us companies led a worldwide bursting of the tech and telecoms bubble .
there is no interest in the stock market and disappointment in economic policies eissa fathy eissa , national securities some analysts drew grim comfort from the fact the market was now reacting to external developments - a sign of increasing sophistication .
but 2000 also saw the telecom egypt flotation pulled , the fleeing of foreign investors and a slump in trading volumes and share prices .
the efg index , which tracks only the 22 largest , most actively traded stocks and is therefore the best gauge of foreign investor activity , went into a particularly sharp decline .
bond issue effect besides worries over global economic slowdown and stock market turmoil , 2001 has been characterised by growing investor disgruntlement with the government as well as unease about worsening relations between israel and the palestinians .
moves that might otherwise have lifted the market - a successful sovereign bond issue , a modest fall in the value of the egyptian pound and the inclusion of egypt in a key emerging markets index - have not done so .
the market can not fall more than this ashraf abdel-aziz , cibc " we expected a positive effect on the stock market but it did n't happen , " says eissa fathy eissa , general manager of national securities brokerage .
after the bond issue , the egyptian pound actually strengthened against the dollar .
and no new foreign investment came .
incentives needed " there is no interest in the stock market and disappointment in -lsb- the government 's -rsb- economic policies , " mr eissa says .
" the fall in confidence is steep . "
like many others , mr eissa says the egyptian pound is still overvalued while high interest rates are unhelpful .
he also wants the government to take the lead in establishing market-maker companies to help bring stability to the stock market .
" we need incentives , at least to keep local investors in the market . "
vodafone sale ?
but there is little sign of that or any juicy morsels from the government - most of the attractive state companies have already been sold off while the long-awaited telecom egypt flotation has been put on ice pending market revival .
the mooted sale of shares in click gsm - a local mobile phone operator part-owned by vodafone - also looks little likely to proceed given current market conditions , raising the prospect of the cairo bourse going through an entire year without any significant initial public offerings .
in the meantime , corporate earnings - most recently from orascom telecom , the market 's second telecoms heavyweight - continue to disappoint .
' no panic ' despite the gloom , many analysts say the market is now undervalued and has little further to fall .
" after what happened -lsb- recently -rsb- and the prices we saw , the market can not fall more than this , " says ashraf abdel-aziz , senior trader at cibc brokerage .
both he and mr eissa say the most actively traded stocks are now " very attractive " and the market should recover with increased turnover after the holiday period .
" in one or two months the market will go up , " says mr abdel-aziz .
" there is no panic . "

the company said it filed the re-hearing request with an appeals court because it believes the ruling was based on " clearly erroneous " findings of a lower court judge .
at the time the lower court had condemned the bundling of microsoft 's internet explorer with windows as a move to head off competition from rival browsers .
three weeks ago , the us court of appeals ruled that microsoft had operated as an illegal monopoly , but it reversed an earlier order by the same lower court to break up the company .
the court of appeals also sent the case back to a different lower court judge to decide a new penalty .
legal options after the ruling , either side was given the option of asking the appeals court to reconsider parts of the decision , appeal against the entire ruling to the supreme court , settle , or go back to a lower court .
the company said the new petition was " a good-faith attempt to seek clarification , " and should not be read as an unwillingness to settle the landmark antitrust case out of court .
microsoft feels that the justice department , the us ' main anti-trust body , has not justified its claim that bundling browser code into the windows system violated competition rules .
for the software giant , the issue affects its whole product strategy and the freedom to add new features to the windows operating system .
speed last week , the justice department moved to speed up the antitrust case , asking the appeals court to immediately send it back to a lower court for reconsideration .
the department said it does not intend to appeal to the supreme court at this time .
the lower court to which the case has now been referred is expected to be more sympathetic to microsoft , as it had previously ruled in microsoft 's favour in a different but similar case .

it was the first time in six years the pro-democracy activist has not turned up at the martyr 's day event in the burmese capital , rangoon .
correspondents say aung san suu kyi 's absence could indicate that talks between the opposition and the military government are not going well .
aung san suu kyi remained at her home and gave no explanation why she had not attended .
' her decision ' there was no indication the government barred her from going .
aung san suu kyi is not formally under house arrest , but has stayed at her residence because of restrictions on her meetings and movements .
aung san suu kyi stayed at home during the ceremony aung san suu kyi , a nobel peace prize winner , was represented at the ceremony by members of her national league for democracy -lsb- nld -rsb- .
an nld spokesman said : " this is her decision .
she asked us to go there . "
the party won elections in 1990 , but burma 's ruling generals refused to let aung san suu kyi take power .
the nld has been in negotiations with the government since october 1990 , but no information has been released as to their progress .
" we have to work very cautiously , " the nld 's secretary , u lwin , told the bbc 's east asia today programme on thursday .
detainees released foreign diplomats who have had access to aung san suu kyi said the talks appeared to have stalled earlier this year , but the nld has nevertheless won some concessions .
the burmese government has released 151 nld detainees and the party has been given permission to reopen 18 of its offices .

it was the first time in six years the pro-democracy activist has not turned up at the martyr 's day event in the burmese capital , rangoon .
correspondents say aung san suu kyi 's absence could indicate that talks between the opposition and the military government are not going well .
aung san suu kyi remained at her home and gave no explanation why she had not attended .
' her decision ' there was no indication the government barred her from going .
aung san suu kyi is not formally under house arrest , but has stayed at her residence because of restrictions on her meetings and movements .
aung san suu kyi , a nobel peace prize winner , was represented at the ceremony by members of her national league for democracy -lsb- nld -rsb- .
an nld spokesman said : " this is her decision .
she asked us to go there . "
the party won elections in 1990 , but burma 's ruling generals refused to let aung san suu kyi take power .
the nld has been in negotiations with the government since october 1990 , but no information has been released as to their progress .
" we have to work very cautiously , " the nld 's secretary , u lwin , told the bbc 's east asia today programme on thursday .
detainees released foreign diplomats who have had access to aung san suu kyi said the talks appeared to have stalled earlier this year , but the nld has nevertheless won some concessions .
the burmese government has released 151 nld detainees and the party has been given permission to reopen 18 of its offices .
eleven nld activists , including four elected members of parliament and a prominent journalist , were released from jail on the eve of martyr 's day .
the occasion commemorates the assassination in 1947 of aung san , burma 's independence leader and its first prime minister .

the hmip inspector 's report raised concerns over cell-sharing between prisoners who had not been fully assessed and did not know each other .
sir david ramsbotham : ' work to be done ' prison chiefs have been advised to carry out a full check on prisoners on their arrival to prevent violent or even fatal incidents from occurring .
the report by the chief inspector of prisons found staff and inmates were " understandably sensitive " to the impact of the death of 35-year-old colin bloomfield , 35 , who died in the prison 's vulnerable person unit in april last year .
cellmate jason ricketts had gouged out mr bloomfield 's eyeball and liver and was sentenced to an indefinite period in a secure hospital after admitting manslaughter with diminished responsibility .
prisoners told us that staff were vigilant in checking on the welfare of individuals hmip inspector 's report the hmip report concluded : " there was no preliminary assessment of individuals that identified potential difficulties of inappropriate cell sharing .
there should be . "
there was praise for prison conditions in general in the report , which followed an unannounced inspection earlier this year .
the inspector praised cardiff prison staff for the way they relate to prisoners and for their awareness to the risk of self-harm and suicide .
' caring staff ' " prisoners told us that staff were vigilant in checking on the welfare of individuals .
" staff did care about prisoners and we fully recognised that many lives had been saved through staff vigilance , " it said .
it was a horrible experience for prisoners and staff and most importantly for the family of the man killed john may , operational manager , prisons in wales two deaths in custody occurred in december 2000 and in january 2001 .
the report was largely satisfied with the controversial detention of up to 40 asylum seekers in cardiff prison .
the detainees are being housed at the prison as part of a much criticised home office programme , prior to the opening of dedicated reception centres .
chief inspector of prisons sir david ramsbotham said the prison service as a whole still had work to do to deal adequately with asylum seekers .
" what is needed is common policy and common practice , laid down throughout the system , including the availability of translations of those documents that apply to every detainee , of whatever nationality , " he said .
operational manager for prisons in wales john may welcomed the report .
he said the ricketts incident had taught lessons to everyone in the prison system .
