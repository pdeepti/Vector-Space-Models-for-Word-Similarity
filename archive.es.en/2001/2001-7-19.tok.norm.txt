timothy woodland , a 24-year-old staff sergeant stationed at kadena air base on the island , allegedly raped an okinawan woman in her 20s in a car park near the airbase in the early hours of 29 june .
mr woodland has maintained his innocence throughout , claiming the sex was consensual .
the case has fuelled local resentment of the huge us military presence .
mr woodland 's indictment came after the naha district court said prosecutors could not detain him beyond thursday , withdrawing a previous decision allowing detention until monday of next week .
prosecutors originally had until 23 july to charge mr woodland , but naha district court on wednesday moved that deadline up to thursday , choko zukeran , a spokesman for the prosecutors office said .
the deadline was reportedly changed after the court determined prosecutors had gathered enough evidence to charge him .
pressuring witnesses the move to indict comes on the heels of a reported push by mr woodland 's lawyer , tsuyoshi arakaki , to get him released , arguing that the suspect 's passport was held by the us military and he was unlikely to flee .
judge misao shimizu , however , said the court was concerned that , if released , mr woodland would meet us military personnel who had witnessed the alleged crime and ask them not to testify against him .
the alleged rape took place in a car park us officials refused to hand mr woodland over to local police for four days after an arrest warrant was issued on 2 july , saying they wanted guarantees that his rights would be protected .
many japanese took the delay as an insult to the nation 's justice system .
mr woodland was finally handed over on 6 july after us and japanese negotiators worked out a handover agreement .
the americans have not released details , but japanese news reports said prosecutors agreed to limit questioning of mr woodland to 10 hours a day and to move quickly on the case .
foot dragging when mr woodland was handed over he became only the second us serviceman to be given up to japanese investigators before formal charges had been filed .
japanese perceptions that washington had dragged its feet before handing mr woodland over revived calls to revise a pact on the status of us military forces in japan .
under the status of forces agreement -lrb- sofa -rrb- , washington need not hand over suspects until they are charged , but has agreed to consider making exceptions for " heinous " crimes .
residents of okinawa , which has about 26,000 us service people stationed there , have been outraged by repeated crimes involving us soldiers , including the gang rape of a 12-year-old girl in 1995 .

the cable television firm made an unsolicited $ 58bn bid for at & t 's broadband arm earlier this month .
at & t said that the bid " did not reflect the full value " of the unit and also expressed concern over the high proportion of voting power that comcast would command .
if the merger had gone ahead , it would have created the world 's largest broadband company with 22 million subscribers .
but the surprise offer has caused at & t to rethink its plans to spin off its broadband arm and it will now examine other alternatives for the division .
end of at & t ?
the planned spin-off was part of a radical restructuring of at & t to split the firm into three separate divisions .
some wall street analysts believed that the break-up of at & t would lead to a series of takeovers and the demise of the at & t brand .
" the big question since at & t announced -lsb- its -rsb- break-up was which unit was going to be the first to be acquired , " said jeffrey kagan , an independent telecoms analyst .
" at & t will cease to exist a year or two from now .
all the pieces will be gobbled up and the at & t brand name will be a nostalgic memory in the history of america business . "
the company now says that it will " explore financial and strategic alternatives relating to at & t broadband , including the previously announced restructuring plans " .
at & t broadband , already the sector leader in the us , includes cable operations and joint ventures such as the high-speed internet unit excite @ home .
comcast disappointment comcast expressed its disappointment that its offer had been rejected .
" we disagree with at & t board 's characterisation of our offer as inadequate , " said the cable firm in a statement .
the statement went on to point out that shareholders had welcomed the proposal and that over $ 14bn has been added to the market valuation of at & t since the offer was made .
comcast also indicated that it is prepared to continue talking to at & t , but has not yet shown any signs of raising its bid .

he added that the appeal court decision still required napster to remove copyrighted works that both it and judge patel had found were violating copyright laws .
" it is important to note that the ruling does not change in any way the fact that napster must prevent copyrighted works from appearing on its system as previously ordered by the court . "

memorabilia the pub is decorated with various items of memorabilia including a picture of parkinson 's favourite footballer george best , which was given to him by elton john , and a caricature of parkinson senior .
" i 'll be leaving all the hard work up to nick , " said parkinson .
" he 's always wanted to own his own place too and we 've been looking for somewhere for ages .
" then we saw this place , and although it was in a terrible state it had potential and it is just down the road from where i live , so we decided to go for it . "

egypt 's stock market , once the apple of the intrepid middle east investor 's eye , has slumped to levels not seen for more than seven years .
while foreign investment has retreated to less risky markets in the face of global economic slowdown , local investors are hoping that the depressed air in cairo will lift when they return to work after summer holidays .
foreign investors have deserted the cairo stock exchange but a combination of local , regional and international factors is making the case for a rebound increasingly hard to make .
milestone five years ago , it all looked rather different .
after several years of slow progress with a privatisation programme that promised the sell-off of 314 state-owned companies , the egyptian government finally gave investors what they wanted - a majority stake in a company heading for the stock market .
egyptian stock market , 2000 turnover : 54bn egyptian pounds market capitalisation : 120bn egyptian pounds -lrb- 35 % of gdp -rrb- number of listed companies : 1,076 number of traded companies : 659 number of actively traded companies : about 100 source : capital markets authority $ 1 = 3.9 egyptian pounds the sale of shares in nasr city housing - an unglamorous company , you might think - proved to be a milestone .
investor interest took off , other initial public offerings followed and the market ended the year 43 % higher than it had begun it .
the number of cairo brokerages climbed into the hundreds and international banks such as hsbc , abn amro and flemings stepped up their presence in one of the region 's few markets with a realistic claim on foreign investor attention .
shortly after , in february 1997 , the benchmark hermes index cleared 16,500 to reach what remains an all-time high .
telecoms frenzy but since then , performance has mostly disappointed , with only a few spurts of excitement along the way .
the flow of initial public offerings dried up and investors grew disillusioned with a government that promised much but delivered little .
the bright spots came largely from the greater numbers of private companies making their way to the market .
mobile phone operator mobinil in early 1999 became the first telecoms firm to list , immediately generating a frenzy of activity .
in months , the company 's shares had more than quadrupled in value , giving an impressive boost to overall market value and turnover .
but the effect was to disguise stagnation in the wider market .
despite this , the market ended the year on a positive note , following the appointment of atef obeid , former privatisation minister , at the head of a new government .
misplaced several analysts confidently identified egypt as an emerging market star for 2000 , awaiting the huge planned flotation of state phone firm telecom egypt .
the optimism soon proved misplaced .
mobinil , which accounted for about 35 % of the bourse 's value , plunged taking the rest of the market with it as us companies led a worldwide bursting of the tech and telecoms bubble .
there is no interest in the stock market and disappointment in economic policies eissa fathy eissa , national securities some analysts drew grim comfort from the fact the market was now reacting to external developments - a sign of increasing sophistication .
but 2000 also saw the telecom egypt flotation pulled , the fleeing of foreign investors and a slump in trading volumes and share prices .
the efg index , which tracks only the 22 largest , most actively traded stocks and is therefore the best gauge of foreign investor activity , went into a particularly sharp decline .
bond issue effect besides worries over global economic slowdown and stock market turmoil , 2001 has been characterised by growing investor disgruntlement with the government as well as unease about worsening relations between israel and the palestinians .
moves that might otherwise have lifted the market - a successful sovereign bond issue , a modest fall in the value of the egyptian pound and the inclusion of egypt in a key emerging markets index - have not done so .
the market can not fall more than this ashraf abdel-aziz , cibc " we expected a positive effect on the stock market but it did n't happen , " says eissa fathy eissa , general manager of national securities brokerage .
after the bond issue , the egyptian pound actually strengthened against the dollar .
and no new foreign investment came .
incentives needed " there is no interest in the stock market and disappointment in -lsb- the government 's -rsb- economic policies , " mr eissa says .
" the fall in confidence is steep . "
like many others , mr eissa says the egyptian pound is still overvalued while high interest rates are unhelpful .
he also wants the government to take the lead in establishing market-maker companies to help bring stability to the stock market .
" we need incentives , at least to keep local investors in the market . "
vodafone sale ?
but there is little sign of that or any juicy morsels from the government - most of the attractive state companies have already been sold off while the long-awaited telecom egypt flotation has been put on ice pending market revival .
the mooted sale of shares in click gsm - a local mobile phone operator part-owned by vodafone - also looks little likely to proceed given current market conditions , raising the prospect of the cairo bourse going through an entire year without any significant initial public offerings .
in the meantime , corporate earnings - most recently from orascom telecom , the market 's second telecoms heavyweight - continue to disappoint .
' no panic ' despite the gloom , many analysts say the market is now undervalued and has little further to fall .
" after what happened -lsb- recently -rsb- and the prices we saw , the market can not fall more than this , " says ashraf abdel-aziz , senior trader at cibc brokerage .
both he and mr eissa say the most actively traded stocks are now " very attractive " and the market should recover with increased turnover after the holiday period .
" in one or two months the market will go up , " says mr abdel-aziz .
" there is no panic . "

the company said it filed the re-hearing request with an appeals court because it believes the ruling was based on " clearly erroneous " findings of a lower court judge .
at the time the lower court had condemned the bundling of microsoft 's internet explorer with windows as a move to head off competition from rival browsers .
three weeks ago , the us court of appeals ruled that microsoft had operated as an illegal monopoly , but it reversed an earlier order by the same lower court to break up the company .
the court of appeals also sent the case back to a different lower court judge to decide a new penalty .
legal options after the ruling , either side was given the option of asking the appeals court to reconsider parts of the decision , appeal against the entire ruling to the supreme court , settle , or go back to a lower court .
the company said the new petition was " a good-faith attempt to seek clarification , " and should not be read as an unwillingness to settle the landmark antitrust case out of court .
microsoft feels that the justice department , the us ' main anti-trust body , has not justified its claim that bundling browser code into the windows system violated competition rules .
for the software giant , the issue affects its whole product strategy and the freedom to add new features to the windows operating system .
speed last week , the justice department moved to speed up the antitrust case , asking the appeals court to immediately send it back to a lower court for reconsideration .
the department said it does not intend to appeal to the supreme court at this time .
the lower court to which the case has now been referred is expected to be more sympathetic to microsoft , as it had previously ruled in microsoft 's favour in a different but similar case .

it was the first time in six years the pro-democracy activist has not turned up at the martyr 's day event in the burmese capital , rangoon .
correspondents say aung san suu kyi 's absence could indicate that talks between the opposition and the military government are not going well .
aung san suu kyi remained at her home and gave no explanation why she had not attended .
' her decision ' there was no indication the government barred her from going .
aung san suu kyi is not formally under house arrest , but has stayed at her residence because of restrictions on her meetings and movements .
aung san suu kyi stayed at home during the ceremony aung san suu kyi , a nobel peace prize winner , was represented at the ceremony by members of her national league for democracy -lsb- nld -rsb- .
an nld spokesman said : " this is her decision .
she asked us to go there . "
the party won elections in 1990 , but burma 's ruling generals refused to let aung san suu kyi take power .
the nld has been in negotiations with the government since october 1990 , but no information has been released as to their progress .
" we have to work very cautiously , " the nld 's secretary , u lwin , told the bbc 's east asia today programme on thursday .
detainees released foreign diplomats who have had access to aung san suu kyi said the talks appeared to have stalled earlier this year , but the nld has nevertheless won some concessions .
the burmese government has released 151 nld detainees and the party has been given permission to reopen 18 of its offices .

it was the first time in six years the pro-democracy activist has not turned up at the martyr 's day event in the burmese capital , rangoon .
correspondents say aung san suu kyi 's absence could indicate that talks between the opposition and the military government are not going well .
aung san suu kyi remained at her home and gave no explanation why she had not attended .
' her decision ' there was no indication the government barred her from going .
aung san suu kyi is not formally under house arrest , but has stayed at her residence because of restrictions on her meetings and movements .
aung san suu kyi , a nobel peace prize winner , was represented at the ceremony by members of her national league for democracy -lsb- nld -rsb- .
an nld spokesman said : " this is her decision .
she asked us to go there . "
the party won elections in 1990 , but burma 's ruling generals refused to let aung san suu kyi take power .
the nld has been in negotiations with the government since october 1990 , but no information has been released as to their progress .
" we have to work very cautiously , " the nld 's secretary , u lwin , told the bbc 's east asia today programme on thursday .
detainees released foreign diplomats who have had access to aung san suu kyi said the talks appeared to have stalled earlier this year , but the nld has nevertheless won some concessions .
the burmese government has released 151 nld detainees and the party has been given permission to reopen 18 of its offices .
eleven nld activists , including four elected members of parliament and a prominent journalist , were released from jail on the eve of martyr 's day .
the occasion commemorates the assassination in 1947 of aung san , burma 's independence leader and its first prime minister .

the hmip inspector 's report raised concerns over cell-sharing between prisoners who had not been fully assessed and did not know each other .
sir david ramsbotham : ' work to be done ' prison chiefs have been advised to carry out a full check on prisoners on their arrival to prevent violent or even fatal incidents from occurring .
the report by the chief inspector of prisons found staff and inmates were " understandably sensitive " to the impact of the death of 35-year-old colin bloomfield , 35 , who died in the prison 's vulnerable person unit in april last year .
cellmate jason ricketts had gouged out mr bloomfield 's eyeball and liver and was sentenced to an indefinite period in a secure hospital after admitting manslaughter with diminished responsibility .
prisoners told us that staff were vigilant in checking on the welfare of individuals hmip inspector 's report the hmip report concluded : " there was no preliminary assessment of individuals that identified potential difficulties of inappropriate cell sharing .
there should be . "
there was praise for prison conditions in general in the report , which followed an unannounced inspection earlier this year .
the inspector praised cardiff prison staff for the way they relate to prisoners and for their awareness to the risk of self-harm and suicide .
' caring staff ' " prisoners told us that staff were vigilant in checking on the welfare of individuals .

it was a horrible experience for prisoners and staff and most importantly for the family of the man killed john may , operational manager , prisons in wales two deaths in custody occurred in december 2000 and in january 2001 .
the report was largely satisfied with the controversial detention of up to 40 asylum seekers in cardiff prison .
the detainees are being housed at the prison as part of a much criticised home office programme , prior to the opening of dedicated reception centres .
chief inspector of prisons sir david ramsbotham said the prison service as a whole still had work to do to deal adequately with asylum seekers .
" what is needed is common policy and common practice , laid down throughout the system , including the availability of translations of those documents that apply to every detainee , of whatever nationality , " he said .
operational manager for prisons in wales john may welcomed the report .
he said the ricketts incident had taught lessons to everyone in the prison system .
