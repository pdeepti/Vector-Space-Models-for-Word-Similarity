bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- wreck carving ' amazes ' divers categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 13 september , 2001 , 05:15 gmt 06:15 uk wreck carving ' amazes ' divers cannon from hms colossus were found on the sea bed divers excavating a wooden statue from the seabed have discovered it is a fragment of one of lord nelson 's ships .
they have stripped away sand to discover that the carving is actually three point nine metres high - much taller than the five feet originally thought .
it makes it many times larger than any other wooden carving found in british waters .
amateur divers who found it in the isles of scilly thought it was a statue of a warrior .
they are classing it as the best carving in british waters carmen mallon but it turned out to be part of the stern of hms colossus , which hit a reef off samson island on the way home from the battle of the nile in 1798 .
colossus was excavated in the 1960s , when thousands of shards of etruscan pottery were recovered .
last year , amateur diver todd stevens found an undiscovered section of the wreck half a mile from the excavated remains .
several 32lb cannon were found .
protection order then carmen mallon , who works for the islands council , dived on the wreck with mr stevens and spotted what appeared to be a hand emerging from the sand .
the find led to the government 's archaeological diving unit -lrb- adu -rrb- placing a protection order on the wreck , preventing all divers from going near it .
mrs mallon told bbc news online : " i did n't have a clue what it was , but todd knew and was amazed . "
scilly 's rocks and reefs were a notorious ships ' graveyard they started to push sand away to reveal more of what appeared to be a statue .
" we got very excited , but we started to run out of air and frantically had to cover it up .
" we came up totally happy and as soon as we could we got to land and called the adu .
" now they are classing it as the best find of a carving in british waters . "
race against time the adu had expected to bring the " statue " to the surface for preservation .
mrs mallon said : " they brought a holding tank and were hoping to keep it on the islands .
" but they have been taken by surprise by the size of it .
" their time and funding is running out and they could have to cover it with sandbags and protective film and leave it down there until next year . "
colossus went aground on a reef off samson while bringing home 200 sick and injured seamen from the battle of the nile .
the ship was laden with etruscan vases collected by lord hamilton , whose wife , emma , was lord nelson 's mistress .
salvage rights have been granted to mac mace , a commercial diver on the islands , although the pottery has already been retrieved .

but alarm bells have started ringing over the costs of the agreement , which came into force in april .
it guarantees a 21.5 % pay increase over three years and more staff in scotland 's schools .
highland council has said the scottish executive 's finance plan ignores gaelic education and the high number of very small schools in the north which cost far more to run .
in the highlands , where one third of the primary schools have fewer than 30 pupils , the deficit will be Â£ 6.5m by 2004 - while argyll and bute , orkney , shetland and the western isles are also facing shortfalls .
