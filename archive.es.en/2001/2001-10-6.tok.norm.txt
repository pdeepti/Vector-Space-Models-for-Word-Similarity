the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , or farc , pledged to put an end to the mass kidnappings of civilians and to study the possibility of a ceasefire .
their activities have given colombia the highest kidnapping rate in the world , averaging more than 10 a day last year .
the agreement came just four days before the government was due to reconsider the status of a rebel enclave in the south of the country , which was ceded to the guerrillas three years ago in an attempt to promote negotiations .
face-saving measure failure to renew the enclave would have meant abandoning the peace talks and launching a military offensive .
the peace process reached a crisis point last week when farc killed former culture minister and popular folk singer consuelo araujo .
she had been captured by the rebels the week before , in one of their infamous kidnappings - known as " pescas milagrosas " , or miracle fishing .
the rebels abduct people for whom they believe they can demand a high ransom .
but the bbc 's jeremy mcdermott in bogota says the deal is little more than a face-saving measure for president andres pastrana , who has staked his entire presidency on achieving peace with the rebels .
analysts say the concessions mean nothing : farc can continue to kidnap for ransom - their main source of income - and the promise to consider a ceasefire was already on the table our correspondent says that the deal does stave off all-out war for at least six months - until the enclave deal is up for renewal again .

the titan iv rocket was launched from vandenberg air force base in california on behalf of the us national reconnaissance office , a secretive agency specialising in providing information for the cia and the national security agency .
the rocket is believed to have been carrying a top secret kh-11 spy satellite - that could monitor afghanistan ahead of an expected military strike .
the us air force refused to comment on the payload , but the nro builds and operates america 's spy satellites and specialises in gathering pictures and electronic data , such as telephone conversations on the ground .
pin-point accuracy experts from aviation week and space technology magazine said the satellite was likely to be equipped with a digital camera able to pick out objects as small as 10 cm -lrb- 4 inches -rrb- across on the ground .
orbiting hundreds of miles above the earth the 15 tonne kh-11 is capable of tracking small groups of people walking on the ground as well as vehicle and weapons movements .
it can monitor conversations and even spot campfires at night using infrared technology .
identifying the enemy according to aviation magazine such information could be used to monitor the movements of taleban groups and refugees to help allied forces separate potentially hostile groups from " non-combatants " .
the united states is believed to have spy satellites over afghanistan already as us forces continue to build up nearby ahead of expected military strikes .
before 1996 the nro did not publicly disclose the launches of its satellites .

in the week she sits once again at the top of both the uk album and singles charts , caroline frost of the bbc 's news profiles unit examines the enduring appeal of this diminutive diva .
in 1988 , a pop phenomenon swept both britain and australia .
the word kylie entered the uk 's national vocabulary , babies were named after the australian star and now , 13 years later , it seems it may just happen again .
she may only be five feet in height , but kylie minogue is walking tall this week .
the song ca n't get you out of my head has become her biggest worldwide-selling single to date , and with her eighth album , fever , she once more takes her place at the pinnacle of pop .
love thy neighbour : kylie and jason 's on-screen wedding she made a cameo appearance in the recent hit film moulin rouge , and last year sang in front of an audience of billions at the sydney olympics .
not bad for someone who came to the public consciousness from the underside of a broken-down car .
as the dungaree-clad , grease-streaked mechanic charlene in hit australian soap neighbours , young kylie proved an unlikely superstar .
but with her big , blue eyes and bigger bubble perm , she captured the late 1980 's zeitgeist .
when kylie and boy-next-door neighbour jason donovan walked up the television aisle to the strains of angry anderson , international celebrity was assured for both .
revelations of their off-screen affair did nothing to hinder their popularity .
the young couple were both signed to formulaic hit-makers stock , aitken and waterman .
they had no control of their own music , but the collaboration capitalised on their fresh-faced appeal and spawned a catalogue of hits .
these days donovan has been consigned to performing to indifferent audiences , but kylie 's career has long exceeded the usual shelf life of a teenage icon .
a hint of hutchence : kylie 's new image if kylie felt constrained by her squeaky clean image , she soon turned it on its head by starting a romance with the bad boy of australian rock , the late michael hutchence .
kylie 's music and appearance became dramatically less innocent , and heralded her gradual divergence from her fan base .
according to kylie , however , hutchence did n't corrupt her .
" he was n't as bad as everyone thought , " she said , " and i was n't as good .
we met somewhere in between . "
her fans remained equally nonplussed when , in 1992 , kylie changed record label and made an attempt at musical reinvention .
collaborations with nick cave and the manic street preachers followed .
kylie reportedly found " singing at the jazz café with nick cave more important than having a number one single " - just as well , as her newly-found credibility did n't exactly make for a host of hits .
by 1998 , kylie minogue was without record label and , apparently , a future .
glamour at the games : sydney 2000 like all real divas , kylie came into her own when the chips were down .
her ability to hit the high notes and camp up her own outrageous glamour had long earned her a loyal gay following , and so in 1998 , she went out on the road , dressed like a trapeze artist , and played to the gallery of these appreciative audiences .
and now she 's back , a fully-formed doyenne of disco , happy to live with the contradictions that her career have brought her .
australian to the core , kylie is regarded as a british national treasure and a straight lads ' fantasy figure .
her performances are flirtatious , but she 's sharing the joke .
what has always been beyond doubt is that kylie can actually sing , and her talent continues to pull her through .
in a business that has seen multitudes of grinning starlets fall off the branch , kylie is back at the top of the tree , better for the years in the wilderness .
kylie : her luck 's holding out she says , " you ca n't manufacture a relationship with your audience .
if you 're pretending , you ca n't get away with it . "
gay audiences can spot a phoney from the back of hammersmith palais , and they all adore her .
she has travelled a musical odyssey , and come back to what she does best .
kylie minogue remains an unashamed pop puppet , but this time around she 's pulling her own strings .

lawyers acting for the family , who live in germany , say the painting was the subject of a forced sale in 1936 under the nazi regime .
the paining , which is valued at £ 30,000 , is currently in store at glasgow 's famous burrell collection .
earlier this year the city council confirmed that 232 of its works of art are on a list of suspected treasures looted by the nazis .
there are national procedures for adjudicating these matters and we have every confidence that if the claim is substantiated the council will do the right thing ephraim borowsky , jewish representative council the 18th century still-life oil painting at the centre of the claim is titled le pate de jambon and is thought to be the work of french artist jean-simeon chardin .
the jewish family claims that they were forced to sell the work through an auction to meet a wrongful tax demand .
lawyers acting for family have contacted glasgow city council 's repatriation working group to put forward their case with a view to the painting being returned .

i watched her closely as i mechanically followed the marchers , microphone slung over my arm to record their familiar chants .
a black dress flapped around her thin legs .
it was covered with a soiled , white undershirt and decorated with a dusty handbag , which hung down her back anchored by a strap that ran around her forehead and through silver grey hair twisted into oily knots .
occasionally she would stop the conversation she was having with herself , look at the demonstrators with wide , red rimmed eyes , and chuckle .
once she even put a hand on her hip and struck a pose .
the arab students at the protest paid no attention .
iraq attack fears they had been called up to show their support for the palestinian intifadah .
first came the palestinians , chanting about sacred land and the power of stones .
then the syrians in disciplined rows , the tunisians tight-lipped and serious , the somalis beautiful and straggling at the rear .
the protest was called to support the palestinian intifada the sudanese strolled along chatting casually until they reached the un headquarters , where they suddenly became sweaty , angry flag burners shouting : " down , down usa . "
they 'd had lots of practice since 1998 .
i remembered that chant echoing through khartoum after a us missile struck the medicine factory allegedly connected to chemical weapons and to osama bin laden .
now it 's osama bin laden again , more strikes expected , and this time it was iraq that might be in the line of fire .
it was the topic on everyone 's mind , but no one could talk about it .
our government minders would not allow us to sound out public opinion .
they had been given strict instructions to prevent any display of anti-american sentiment .
baghdad did n't want to encourage the hawks in washington that were lobbying to put it on the list of targets .
intifada it was n't clear to me why the sudanese could burn american flags when i could n't even ask a question about america , but of course , it was clear to the minder : these are other arabs , he emphasised , not iraqis .
hmm , yes of course , an obvious distinction .
i was allowed to ask questions about the intifadah , so i soldiered on .
" what has the intifadah achieved , do you think it has affected events , in the wider world , " i askedy .
one jordanian student took the bait .
" people have been distracted from the intifadah since the us attacks , " he said .
" i think israel carried them out . "
the people were supposed to keep quiet but curiously the authorities exercised no such restraint .
of course they were quick to deny any link , especially the reports of alleged meetings between iraqi intelligence officers and osama 's people but they pounded home their controversial message .
accusations it is not iraq that carries out terrorism , says saddam hussein .
it 's israel and the united states - military operations against the palestinians , american warplanes that bomb iraqi targets in air exclusion zones .
these , he said , were actions outside international law .
iraq was notably the only arab country that did not initially condemn the attacks .
that did n't go down well in washington at all .
but the iraqi president refused to budge .
to send condolences would be hypocritical when america was waging war on iraq , he said , and we are not hypocrites .
the americans need advice more than condolences , one of his deputies added .
that is why we stressed it was time for them to rethink their foreign policy , which is what led to the new york attacks , he said .
all perfectly logical from an iraqi point of view , and , it has to be said , in many parts of the arab world .
in fact , the words were probably directed at the arab world , but not exactly designed to deflect angry attention from across the ocean .
the authorities continued to direct local attention to the anniversary of the palestinian uprising .
at another rally tens of thousands of people were bussed to the parade grounds in baghdad .
mass organisation there were lots of anti-israeli slogans and banners .
the israeli prime minister ariel sharon was burned in effigy , but iraq 's public enemy number one did not get similar treatment .
these were iraqis , after all , not other arabs .
the us , what us ? said the people .
it 's not our concern .
i could n't help but feel a grudging admiration for this rather impressive feat of mass organisation , in every respect .
privately , people did express fears that iraq would be hit , and hit hard .
but concerns about america 's plans were added to an already heavy load of daily burdens - the struggle to survive after more than a decade of un sanctions .
to some extent there was a resigned air of deja vu .
we 've been here before , we know what to do , we certainly know what to say .
i thought again of the vagrant woman while waiting a long hour for police to confirm that i was n't a spy .
we were , unfortunately , arrested while filming a sun setting over palm trees , blissfully unaware that behind the trees lay a key communications centre .
the woman 's inner world was completely divorced from the reality passing by ; she was oblivious to the political dramas and undercurrents , to the dirt ground into her feet and elbows , to her madness , instead laughing with herself at some private joke .

bbc news -pipe- england -pipe- dolphins face death in nets categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : england front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 6 october , 2001 , 09:23 gmt 10:23 uk dolphins face death in nets dead dolphins have been found tied together thousands of dolphins could be illegally killed off the coasts of france and the west country this winter , a leading campaigner has warned .
the number of dead dolphins being washed ashore on the beaches of devon and cornwall has risen every year since 1990 .
devon campaigner lindy hingley said that this winter the toll in devon could reach 100 - thought to represent only a small percentage of those trapped in trawl nets .
the rise is linked to trawlers working in pairs , with giant nets strung between them .
dolphins are unable to escape from trawl nets the dolphins are caught in the nets as an unwanted " by-catch " - often while feeding on fish .
" the dolphins do n't stand a chance , " said mrs hingley , joint owner of a local trawler and founder of brixham seawatch , set up to monitor dolphin and whale sightings .
" they are mammals and they need to come up for air , and they ca n't .
" they drown in these giant nets .
" common dolphins are dying in their thousands . "
mrs hingley 's warning is endorsed by the whale and dolphin conservation society , based in bath .
the society said europe 's common fisheries policy fails to protect sea mammals , because it leaves individual nations to control their own crews and waters .
rotting carcasses there is no monitoring of catches aboard the growing number of pair-trawlers that head for the english channel in search of mackerell and sea-bass .
we have had a few which were obviously alive when they got them on board .
they would have died of their injuries anyway lindy hingley , brixham seawatch europe-wide action is needed as part of a current review of the fisheries policy , the society says .
ships from several countries - including the uk - use the pair-trawling method in the english channel .
one devon boatman has told how he saw 14 pairs working as a single fleet .
mrs hingley , who is taking part in a conference on wildlife crime at exeter this weekend , found 87 common dolphins on devon beaches last year .
many had ropes attached to their tails , used by trawlermen to sling their heavy bodies over the side .
two were even tied together , having been caught in the same trawl .
local boats whose nets trawl the sea bed also brought up rotting carcasses , said mrs hingley .
often the bodies had puncture wounds , apparently made on the pair-trawlers so they would sink .
that way the bodies would be less likely to reach the shore , thus disguising the scale of the scale of problem , she said .
" they cut right through the heart and lungs and get the air out of them , " mrs hingley told bbc news online .
" we have had a few which were obviously alive when they got them on board .
they would have died of their injuries anyway . "
sixty bodies last winter mrs hingley sent 60 bodies to london for post-mortem examination .
" every single one was an illegal by-catch , " she said .
" the problem is growing because there are many more boats doing it . "
much of mrs hingley 's information comes from within the industry itself , from local fishermen who know her as a colleague .
" a lot are very angry , " said said .
" they love to see dolphins and they feel quite strongly about it . "
