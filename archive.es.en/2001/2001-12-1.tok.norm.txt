sir neil chalmers , director of the natural history museum said : " i welcome the government 's emphasis on widening access for visitors to museums , and am keen to continue attracting as diverse a mix of visitors as possible . "

ironically , sinatra also credited lennon and mccartney for penning it - an illustration , the paper suggests , of one of the many moments in which harrison never felt fully appreciated in the band and which led to an undercurrent of resentment .
the mirror believes the final days of the beatles saw anarchy and acrimony .
when asked if he had a message for paul mccartney , harrison , the paper says , would raise his middle finger and answer : ' ' yeah , give him this . "
the relationship recovered and the daily express on friday described a weeping sir paul mccartney leading the tributes to his friend and ' baby brother ' .
the daily mail describes harrison as the " ordinary beatle " , and it is the guitarist 's aversion to celebrity which is highlighted in the many obituaries .
the former monty python star , michael palin , tells the independent how harrison did not like the trappings of stardom and wanted to be himself - pursuing his own interests .

exotic the subject of the painting was a polynesian youth who was feted as a noble savage by london society during the late 18th century .

the survey drew comparisons with germany where less than 40 % said cost was a factor , and where far more people are using high-speed services .
broadband users in germany number well over one million .
by contrast , the uk 's high-speed net users have yet to pass 500,000 .
price difference " it 's such a striking contrast in terms of the numbers of subscribers and the rate they are signing up , " said terry lawlor , a spokesman for support.com which commissioned the survey .
mr lawlor said german net users were subscribing to high-speed net access at a rate of up to 30,000 per week .
in the uk , the figures are barely a tenth of this total .
he said the difference was entirely down to the cost of net access .
a much smaller percentage of those questioned , 22 % , said availability was stopping them signing up .
in germany 30 hours of high-speed net access over a dsl line cost about £ 20 , he said .
installing the service cost £ 30 .
by contrast , bt openworld currently charges £ 75 for installation and £ 39.99 per month for its dsl service .
cable modem services from ntl and telewest were cheaper , but still more expensive than in germany , said mr lawlor .
in the same week the support.com survey was unveiled , cardiff businessman barrie desmond kicked off a campaign to get one million people to sign a petition calling on the government to act over broadband services .
mr desmond said fast net services were a basic service that everyone should be able to enjoy .
he called on the government to subsidise them to enable more people to take them up .
he said more needed to be done to educate small businesses , schools and consumers about the benefits of fast net access .
the petition can be signed via the broadband4britain website .
speedy subscription those who do have broadband services are gradually finding that they can do more with them .
this week bt openworld announced the start of a classical music subscription service for broadband users .
for £ 7.99 per month , subscribers get the right to stream unlimited numbers of classical tracks and download up to 10 of them for burning on to cds or placing in a portable player .
a customised version of microsoft 's media player is being used to prevent music being pirated .
bt openworld also announced a trial of a game subscription service that , for £ 9.99 per month , lets subscribers play over 200 games .
both the subscription services are open to customers of any broadband isp .
bt openworld has also announced an alliance with sony to develop multiplayer games for its playstation 2 console .

until now the watchdog has been restricted under old laws which meant it could only act against registered city professionals .
the watchdog will now have the power to launch criminal prosecutions or levy unlimited fines against any individual .
instead of statutory powers , it merely did the work for more than ten " self-regulatory bodies " - non-statutory regulators paid for by member firms which had to be registered to conduct business .
that has hampered investigations into financial crimes such as the sumitomo copper scandal in 1996 , where a rogue trader at the london metals exchange lost £ 1.5bn of his bank 's money trying to manipulate the copper price .
city watchdogs were unable to prosecute the trader , yasuo hamanaka , because he was not directly regulated , even though his crimes took place in london .
prosecuted in tokyo , he later admitted forgery and fraud .
we intend to be a reforming authority , constantly on the lookout for changes which will reinforce the statutory objectives handed down to us by parliament howard davies , fsa chairman similarly , only a handful of people have gone to prison in the last ten years for the crime of insider dealing because of the difficulty of proving it beyond doubt .
in the past five years only two people have gone to prison for the offence , with five others fined .
the fsa will now investigate under a new civil offence of market abuse that requires a lighter burden of proof .
judge and jury ?
anyone , from a trader to a share tipper on the internet , could face an unlimited fine if they breach the fsa 's code of market conduct .
the fsa 's powers to investigate , prosecute and impose fines have led many in the financial community to fear it will be too powerful - acting , according to advertising guru maurice saatchi , as " judge , jury and executioner " .
however , the fsa 's chairman howard davies dismisses the objection , which he says is no longer relevant .
a regulatory decisions committee , composed of retired directors of major companies and consumer representatives , will have oversight of decisions if individuals believe they have been treated unfairly .
he says the fsa 's aim is to maintain a " proportionate approach " .
" we intend to be a reforming authority , constantly on the lookout for changes which will reinforce the statutory objectives handed down to us by parliament . "
carol sergeant , the former bank of england official in charge of enforcement at the fsa , says instead of imposing a heavy burden of bureaucracy on everyone it regulates , the aim is to develop a " risk-based approach " - where instead of using the same checks on every firm the fsa focuses on areas or companies where it sees a likelihood of something going wrong .
the fsa has already been heavily criticised , not least by its own internal auditors , for serious failings in its handling of the collapse of equitable life , the mutual life insurer whose policyholders have lost nearly a third of their investment since it was forced to stop doing business last december .
it has also been criticised for being slow to act in the collapse of independent insurance , the general insurer which went bust earlier this year .
calls for action the consumer 's association is urging the watchdog to " show its teeth " .
" this is a real opportunity and challenge for the regulator to work proactively to protect consumers , to prevent financial scandals and to ensure consumer confidence when investing in the industry , " said the director of the consumers ' association , sheila mckechnie .
" a consumer focused regulator is needed now more than ever to improve industry performance and consumer confidence in a sector dogged by scandal . "
separately , financial consultants are warning that most firms which will come under the fsa 's ambit will not be in a position to comply with the new regime from tonight .
kpmg has warned that most financial firms have yet to alter their systems and could find themselves on the wrong side of the law .
