the blasts , which took place shortly after one another , happened in an area packed with shops and restaurants shortly after midnight local time and were followed by a car bomb explosion 20 minutes later .
it was a truly horrible attack , one of the worst we have ever had israeli foreign minister shimon peres a caller purporting to be from the palestinian militant group islamic jihad told the bbc that the group was responsible and promised new attacks imminently .
israeli prime minister ariel sharon , who warned of a " commensurate " response , is cutting short a visit to the us , bringing forward talks with president george w bush by one day to sunday at noon local time -lrb- 1700 gmt -rrb- .
hours after the attack , israeli forces arrested several alleged militants in the village of abu dis on the outskirts of jerusalem .
reports say about 170 people , many of them revellers in their late teens , were also injured in the attacks , described by israeli foreign minister shimon peres as " one of the worst ... ever seen " .
an israeli government official said mr arafat was guilty of a " total lack of action in the domain of fighting terror " .
but the palestinian leadership issued a strongly-worded statement , condemning the attacks and pledging to track down those responsible .
claim a caller saying they represented islamic jihad phoned the bbc bureau in jerusalem and claimed responsibility for the attacks .
the caller , who spoke arabic , said there would be further action against israel during the holy month of ramadan , which runs for approximately another two weeks .
the caller rang off before further details could be asked .
earlier on saturday , palestinian police arrested a top member of islamic jihad , mohammed al-hindi , based in gaza city after a gun battle at his home .
islamic jihad and fellow militants hamas have threatened to avenge israel 's killing last month of a hamas military leader , abu hanoud .
city shaken witnesses saw people thrown into the air by the force of the blasts on ben yehuda street , which could be heard across the city .
our correspondent says many people in the area are in a state of shock .
the area would have been particularly busy at the time , just after the end of the jewish sabbath .
the first blast happened outside a cafe in the ben yehuda shopping centre .
a passer-by , yossi mizrahi , told reuters news agency of the carnage : " i saw people without arms .
i saw a person with their stomach hanging open .
i saw a 10 year-old-boy breathe his last breath .
i ca n't believe anybody would do anything like this . "
us demand the attacks came as senior us envoy anthony zinni was visiting israel and palestinian-controlled areas to try to secure a ceasefire .
mr zinni phoned mr arafat on saturday night and urged him to do everything to find the organisers of the attacks .
" i spoke with chairman arafat tonight and made absolutely clear that those responsible for planning and carrying out these attacks must be found and brought to justice , " he said .
the us envoy 's arrival last week coincided with an upsurge in violence .
on thursday , an islamic jihad militant blew himself up on a bus , killing himself and three israelis , and two palestinians were reportedly shot dead by israeli troops on saturday .

the suicide bombers can get right to their targets by bbc news online 's kate milner suicide bomb attacks against israeli targets have become the most dramatic and bloody weapon in the armoury of the palestinian militant groups .
it is a measure of the hatred of israel felt by some palestinians that there appears to be no shortage of recruits ready to die for their cause .
the suicide bombers are typically unmarried men in their late teens and 20s .
they act in the belief that they will go straight to paradise , where they will get places of honour next to god .
media-conscious most of the bombers are affiliated to the palestinian militant groups hamas or islamic jihad .
israelis fear a new wave of attacks such attacks are , according to analysts , planned meticulously , along the lines of a military operation .
in some cases , support teams transport the bomber by van or car to the location minutes before the detonation .
the palestinian militant groups , which are sunni muslim , resemble the lebanese shia 'a militant group hezbollah in that they are acutely media-conscious and the timing and positioning of attacks are carefully considered to achieve the maximum public impact .
the explosives usually have a hand-pulled detonator rather than a button , because it is less likely to go off accidentally .
promised rewards some media reports have speculated that suicide bombers take drugs before they go on their missions , but this would run contrary to the strict religious teachings they adhere to .
they are likely to be motivated by religious fervour .
the bombers often target buses in israel according to islamic tradition , he who gives his life for an islamic cause will have his sins forgiven and a place reserved in paradise .
for many years , suicide attacks on israelis have been seen by some palestinians as just such acts of martyrdom .
recruits are reassured by their organisation that their families will be looked after materially until they die , and there are charitable organisations that exist for this purpose .
recruits are picked out from mosques , schools and religious institutions .
they are likely to have shown particular dedication to the principles of islam , and are singled out for deeper study .
gradually , they get more involved in political issues , and are taught the rewards that will await them if they sacrifice their lives .
eventually , many of them will volunteer for a suicide mission , hoping for greater glory .
they will spend less and less time with their families and devote themselves to religious study and spiritual preparation .
they are sent out with just a day or two 's notice on how and where to blow themselves up .
faced with men who embrace their mission with such zeal , israeli security forces will have to be extra vigilant to stop them .

we will be doing a deep and thorough examination of our mistakes kmt chairman lien chan senior party officials looked numbed by the scale of their rejection at the hands of taiwan 's electorate .
even the most dire predictions in the run up to the 1 december poll had not forecast a result this bad for the kmt .
the kmt failed to inspire voters after the debacle of the 2000 presidential elections in which the kmt 's lien chan came a distant third , this is the second major setback in two years .
" i think we will be doing a deep and thorough examination of our mistakes , " said the kmt 's chairman .
but people will be asking why such an examination was not done a year ago .
lien chan 's position must now be threatened .
scale of defeat to get a sense of just how serious this result is for the kmt it is worth bearing in mind that the party 's own target was to hold 80 to 90 of its 110 parliamentary seats .
the dpp favours taiwan 's independence - but we will carry it out very cautiously and patiently dpp secretary-general wu nai-ren the pundits said that winning less than 75 would be grim .
in the end the kmt has 68 seats in parliament .
its share of the vote has fallen from 46 % to 31 % .
the pundits also said that the dpp would score a big victory if it could rise to 85 seats .
it now has 87 .
the dpp did even better than expected there are several reasons for the kmt 's shocking performance : it has failed to learn the lessons of the presidential elections ; its leader is uninspiring ; and the party has mistakenly believed its past success transforming taiwan into a modern economy will win it votes now .
" it has lost its sense of mission , " says james miles , a china specialist at the economist magazine .
" having lifted martial law , and presided over rapid political transition they have nothing else to focus on . "
the kmt 's policy of seeking eventual reunification with china is not a vote winner in taiwan , where people are proud of their identity .
local resentment many on the island resent a party they see as an alien force imported from the mainland , which ruled taiwan with an iron fist .
and the kmt has paid the price for using the majority it had in parliament to block the policies of president chen shui-bian in the past year and a half .
taiwanese voters have penalised the kmt for its blind opposition to a popularly elected president .
they want parties that will tackle their economic problems not fight amongst themselves .
the shockwaves from this election will already have reached beijing .
since president chen was elected china has shunned him .
his dpp party has advocated independence for taiwan , and china 's leaders mistrust him .
bridge building president chen has made attempts to reach out to china .
he has moderated the dpp 's position on independence .
but beijing has sought to build bridges with the kmt instead .
it has cost the kmt dear .
being seen as cozying up too much to china is another reason the kmt has fared badly .
the result though does not mean china is any more likely to talk to president chen .
in fact it might mistrust him more if it believes the win for his party will make him more bold .
china has shunned president chen and there may already be signs the dpp feels more confident .
in the glow of victory its secretary-general , wu nai-ren , told the bbc : " the dpp favours taiwan 's independence , it 's true .
we do n't deny that .
but we will carry it out very cautiously and patiently . "
notable amongst the other results was the collapse of the pro-china new party .
it was mirrored by the success of the newly-formed taiwan solidarity union .
independence issue the tsu supports independence .
it captured 13 seats , and is a likely coalition partner for the dpp .
it has the backing of former president lee teng-hui , a man reviled by china .
the sight of former president lee and current president chen co-operating will send shudders through beijing .
china will fear a link-up with former president lee teng-hui but perhaps the biggest success of the night was the remarkable achievement by the people first party .
a kmt splinter group , it had been seen as a one-man party , living off the popularity of its leader , james soong .
now it has more than doubled its seats , and mr soong will be looking to use his new power to prepare for another presidential bid .
what next ?
so where does this leave taiwan ?
the pressing question is : can president chen form a coalition that will give him a majority in parliament .
the pfp and the kmt could just thwart him if they combine forces , but their leaders hate each other .
to secure his coalition the president will be making every effort to woo defectors from the kmt with promises of positions or political payoffs .
in his favour is the momentum and the moral authority earnt through this victory .
it is likely he will get some legislators to jump from the kmt 's demoralised ship , but not even president chen knows if it will be enough to put taiwan 's recent instability behind it . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's damian grammaticas in taipei " a moment of profound political change " key stories employment nightmare wto wildcard stars vie for votes tackling vote buyers kmt wealth probe gay campaign background key issues party profiles see also : 01 dec 01 -pipe- asia-pacific taiwan turns away from old masters 21 nov 01 -pipe- asia-pacific taiwan election campaign opens 16 nov 01 -pipe- business recession hits taiwan 21 feb 01 -pipe- asia-pacific q & a : taiwan 's relations with china 06 aug 01 -pipe- country profiles country profile : taiwan internet links : taiwan government information office kmt dpp the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : s korea subway inferno toll rises us plays down n korean threat thai pm says officials peddling drugs australia refuses to lift bali warning chinese official vows to end corruption japanese emperor back to work leatherbacks ' extinct in 30 years ' new project to demine tajikistan links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

bbc one 's kenyon confronts presenter paul kenyon infiltrated the greyhound racing world by posing as an owner and trainer .
the undercover investigation found a trainer at one of london 's top tracks who fixes races and a man selling drugs for dogs at tracks throughout northern england .
you ca n't mention this to anyone because , obviously , what i 'm doing is illegal trainer lennie knell each year £ 1.5bn is gambled on the dogs in the uk .
however , according to one of the most experienced kennel hands in the sport , a huge number of races are fixed , particularly those run on non-official tracks .
over-feeding dogs on camera , the kennel hand admits to fixing hundreds of races , and claims the public has more chance of winning the lottery than making money at the dogs .
trainer lennie knell and colleague colin west are caught on secret camera offering to fix a race by over-feeding a dog at a race track in catford , south london .
at one point mr west boasts they made £ 11,000 from a fixed race .
trainer mr knell warned the bbc undercover team : " you ca n't mention this to anyone because , obviously , what i 'm doing is illegal . "
at a track in northern england a well known greyhound drug dealer sold the kenyon confronts team various drugs to speed up , and slow down , dogs .
the dealer said the strongest drug he uses is cocaine and claims to have made £ 29,000 in one day on fixed races .
mass grave the programme also discovered a mass grave for dogs in oxfordshire .
an estimated 10,000 greyhounds retire from racing each year but only a small number are re-homed , as many disappear in mysterious circumstances .
trainer steve davis keeps hundreds of dogs at his kennels in oxfordshire and , according to former workers , has shot dozens with an unlicensed sawn-off rifle .
they said davis saw greyhounds as a commodity and killed them once they were too old or injured to race .
in a late night raid the kenyon confronts team dug up some of davis ' land and found the mass grave hiding the carcass of one dead greyhound and the bones of others .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- nuclear tests at warp speed categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 2 december , 2001 , 09:14 gmt nuclear tests at warp speed asci white : size of two basketball courts bbc click online 's david jamieson is granted special permission to visit the high security us facility which houses one of the world 's fastest supercomputers .
the nuclear bomb is the most awesome manmade destructive force there is , but these most powerful of weapons are no longer atmospherically tested .
the testing of the us 's nuclear weapons now takes place inside one of the world 's fastest computers , ibm 's asci white .
" we have to have the capability to simulate the explosion of a nuclear warhead , " said david novak , deputy associate director of the asci programme , at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , just outside of san francisco .
" that 's very challenging in its own right .
" it 's very high temperature , very high density , very short periods of time , strong shocks travelling around - all the things that make a simulation difficult occur here . "
fast simulations the asci white is the size of two basketball courts .
over 8,000 processors linked together by a high-speed network give it a peak operating speed of over 12 trillion calculations per second .
novak : aims to build world 's fastest , most powerful simulation capability it has six terabytes of memory , and 160 terabytes of disk space , enough to hold six times the entire book collection of the library of congress .
" on the hardware side , its goal is to build the fastest , most powerful simulation capability in the world , " said mr novak .
" on the software side , the idea is to develop large-scale codes that will run as efficiently on 10,000 processors as if they were running on one computer . "
simulations run on asci white can be visualised on a massive display screen in a nearby conference room .
as well as modelling explosions , the computer is used for studying the way nuclear weapons change composition as the stockpile of warheads ages .
" not only are they exposed to harsh environments and atmospheres , but they 're also radioactive , so the radioactive decay of the material causes the material composition to change , " said mr novak .
" it also causes interaction between the various elementary particles that are emitted in the decay to interact with other materials , and change the performance . "
security precautions at all times throughout the site , there are reminders that this is a classified facility .
even the windows to the vault can , at the flick of a switch , be made opaque when classified operations are under way .
but asci white is also used for peaceful purposes .
major us universities work on the machine to research the way stars explode , simulate the performance of jet engines and rocket motors , and test how materials react under intense shocks .
as powerful as asci white is , some of the life science computing challenges on the near horizon will demand even faster machines .
white itself will no doubt be left in the dust , as the race for more computing speed continues .

i saw three dead and what looked like the remains of the suicide bomber .
it was just a lump of something michael perry , witness nir ledani , aged 20 , was with friends in the popular cafe district in the heart of the city when the two bombers detonated their explosives .
" i heard the sound of a fuse .
then i heard a boom ...
i saw a huge orange flash , " he said later .
the bombs were packed with nails and mr ledani was himself injured , with a fragment of metal and a nail embedded in his shoulder .
a woman called ilana said that one of the bombers wore a red shirt and jeans .
" he stood and just blew himself up , " she said .
' there were lots of limbs and dead ' witnesses described how the force of the explosions catapulted bodies into the air .
i saw people without arms .
i saw a person with their stomach hanging open .
i saw a 10-year-old boy breathe his last breath yosshi mizrahi , witness " a lot of people were crying , falling and there was the smell of burning hair , " said eli shetreet , aged 19 .
" people flew into the air and there were many people covered in blood , " said a young woman called liron .

i collapsed and that is the last thing i remember until i woke up in hospital , " he added .
the car had been blocking the street to the scene of the first attack and people had been attempting to move it to clear the way for the emergency services when it went off .
