pharmaceutical company schering health care claims the drug is targeted at the most common form of the illness , which mainly affects people aged over 50 years .
it is the first monoclonal antibody to be approved and licensed for the treatment of b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia -lrb- b-cll -rrb- - an incurable condition which affects more than 2,000 people in britain every year .
we welcome the development of another weapon in the fight leukaemia research fund conventional anti-cancer drugs have proved largely ineffective in combating the illness as they destroy healthy cells as well as cancerous ones .
the body 's immune system is unable to distinguish between the two .
the new treatment is more discriminating as it has the ability to highlight the cancerous cells to the immune system which is then able to mop them up while leaving the healthy ones alone .
side effects consultant haematologist dr peter hillmen , of pinderfields general hospital , west yorkshire , said the drug was a major step forward .
" in trials this drug has been shown to be effective in one third of heavily pre-treated patients , " he said .
" it is the first drug to prove effective in advanced case patients who have failed first-line and the gold-standard second-line treatment for b-cll . "
b-cll is a blood disorder in which abnormal b-lymphocytes -lrb- white blood cells -rrb- build up in the bone marrow , blood and organs of the body , causing infection , bone marrow dysfunction and enlargement of the lymph nodes , liver and spleen .
the most common side effects of the new treatment are fever and shivering while the drug is being administered and an increased risk of infection during the course of treatment and for about two months afterwards .
new ' weapon ' the leukaemia research fund welcomed the development of " another weapon " in the fight against the disease .
scientific director dr david grant said there was increasing evidence that there are two forms of this type of leukaemia , one being much more aggressive and life-threatening than the other .
" while many patients may require no treatment at all , especially in the first instances , we desperately need new ways to treat younger patients and those who are resistant to current therapies , " he said .
" lrf researchers are devising ways to distinguish between indolent and more aggressive chronic leukaemias .
" if we can pick out patients with a poorer prognosis earlier they can be given more intensive therapy when they are fitter and better able to tolerate it .

output among small and medium sized manufacturers fell in the four months to july at its fastest rate since october 1999 , the report said .
and amongst the smallest manufacturers , confidence over future exports hit its lowest ebb for almost three years .
overall , 43 % of firms surveyed were less optimistic about business conditions in july , and only 15 % more upbeat .
but the balance of confidence was , at -28 % , slightly less than the -30 % figure reported in the last survey , in april , at the height of the crisis surrounding the outbreak of foot-and-mouth in uk livestock .
simon bartley , vice chairman of the cbi 's small and medium sized firms -lrb- smes -rrb- council , said : " sme manufacturers are facing extreme pressure from the global slowdown .
" they continue to experience falling orders whether they are suppliers to larger uk manufacturers or directly to us or international companies . "
while the latest cut in uk interest rates offers some hope of stemming declines in confidence , smaller manufacturers will be reliant on global ; factors for an improvement in business conditions .
the survey , while illustrating the pressure smes face , will come as little surprise a week after official data confirmed britain had entered recession .

mr rumsfeld has already held face-to-face talks with his russian counterpart sergei ivanov , and the two were due to head a longer session with aides , including us undersecretary of state for arms control john bolton and undersecretary of defence for policy doug feith .
this is donald rumsfeld 's first visit to moscow as defence secretary .
the trip had been scheduled to last two days , but mr rumsfeld managed to condense them into a single 14-hour day .
apart from his engagements with mr ivanov , which include a river cruise and dinner at the us visitor 's hotel , mr rumsfeld may meet russian president vladimir putin , who agreed to the visit at talks with us president george w bush at their encounter in italy last month .
arms race threat the americans plan to build a missile defence shield to protect themselves against attacks by what washington considers to be rogue states .
but moscow is sticking to its objections - a missile shield is unnecessary at best , it says , and at worst could lead to a new nuclear arms race .
the americans appear to have acknowledged that the russians will not be easily persuaded .
pentagon officials stress that the defence secretary is not aiming for any concrete results during this visit .
compromise the best hope for the americans is that the question of missile defence can be linked to other security issues close to moscow 's heart .
the russians are keen to make big cuts in their nuclear arsenal in order to save money .
moscow is also worried about plans to expand nato membership further into eastern europe .

a slump in company takeovers and mergers has left investment banks without work to support corporate financiers , who advise on these deals .

you 'll need to make the grade before you get these every time you apply for credit , whether for a loan , mortgage or credit card , the lender checks your credit record .
to do this , they will contact central databases held by private companies , called credit reference agency .
what is a credit reference agency ?
the role of these agencies is help lenders make decisions on whether or not to offer you credit .
they do not make these decisions themselves , but supply financial information about you to the lenders .
the lender uses this information to make a decision on whether or not you are credit worthy .
what is on my credit reference file ?
the first thing on your file will be information taken from the electoral roll .
this will identify any addresses at which you 've been registered .
details of any earlier credit agreements will also appear .
this is used to make sure you have repaid earlier loans on time .
also , each time you apply for credit this is recorded , so all earlier credit applications appear on the file .
the files do not say if that application was successful or not .
if you have had legal trouble with creditors in the past then chances are that will also be on your file .
and your file may also include an county court judgements made against you .
why should i check my credit file ?
most of us will go a lifetime without ever worrying about our files .
but it can pay to be aware of what 's on your credit file .
mistakes do happen and it would be a pity to be refused a loan because of something you did n't do or because your record was incomplete .
even if you are not applying for a loan , there are many services and products which will require some form of credit check -lrb- mail order account and mobile phone operators for instance -rrb- .
why do errors occur the world is an imperfect place , and unfortunately mistakes will happen .
sometimes when payments or settlements are late , your details may be sent to the credit reference agency and marked on your credit file , even though you may have paid while this is happening .
there can be mistakes in matching data to people , so for example , you may find an incorrect address listed on your records .
how do i get hold of my file ?
there are two credit reference agencies in the uk , experian and equifax , and you should contact them both .
they each hold slightly different information about you on their files .
getting the information will cost you £ 2 and you need to include a cheque or postal order with your request .
what should i look for ?
check all the details on your file and make sure they are right .
also make sure that they are up to date and include your latest credit details - typically the more good credit history you have the better your chances of getting more credit .
an information leaflet will be included with your file to help you understand the information and decipher the jargon used .
things to check current and past addresses current and past credit agreements past credit applications county court judgements if you find a mistake make sure you tell the credit reference agency about it .
they will then take it up with whoever provided them with the information .
you may find details of other members of your family on your file .
this can be useful in helping you get credit for the first time .
you can ask for your credit information to be separated from other members of your household by completing a notice of disassociation .
the credit reference company can explain how you should do this .
how do i make myself creditworthy ?
ensure you are on the electoral register -lrb- check by contacting your local authority -rrb- .
a lender will want confirmation that you live at the address you are giving them on your credit application .
do not make too many applications for credit in a short space of time - it might suggest you are being turned down or you are overstretching yourself .
if you fail to meet a loan repayment , try to make it up quickly .
long-term non-payment will be noted on your credit file and will remain there for six years , making it difficult for you to obtain credit .
if you do find yourself falling behind with payments , keep the lender informed - do n't ignore the problem .
how do i contact the agencies ?
