collectors are willing to pay vast sums of money for the rarest specimens and it seems this has now attracted a criminal element .
we have learned of two major thefts in the past six months in south africa and germany .
with a piece of lunar meteorite now commanding a price of £ 20,000 a gram - that is 3,000 times the price of gold - experts believe the number of thefts can only increase .
internet driven dr monica grady , who leads the meteorites and micrometeorites programme at the natural history museum , london uk , said : " i think once communication gets round that meteorites are very collectable , very tradable , then it 's possible there will be more theft .
" with better communications over the past few years on the internet , people are able to buy and sell meteorites internationally .
there are more people going out and collecting them for themselves , " she told the bbc .
" it 's easier , for example , to get into the sahara to get meteorites and bring them back and sell them .
there is a huge increase in the numbers of meteorites that are actually on the market , and a corresponding increase in the number of people that are buying them and are willing to collect them . "
one of the pieces stolen in south africa , a nickel-iron meteorite found in the vryburg district of the northern cape province , is described as " scientifically priceless " .
it was just one item in a mass theft of more than 150 meteorite and mineral specimens from a museum .
red planet the german meteorite , known as the ramsdorf main mass , was taken from a private collector .
other valuables left behind by the thieves made police think the space rock was stolen to order .
beyond their market price , meteorites are hugely important to science .
some specimens , which incorporate grains that have been largely unaltered since the birth of the solar system , can tell us how the earth and other planets formed .
the 16 martian meteorites , for example , have revealed astonishing information about the red planet 's wet and warm past , and have even suggested the presence of microbial lifeforms .
but although science may be a victim of this new crime , it might also be an unwitting accomplice , warns ralph p harvey , assistant professor at case western reserve university , ohio , and principal of the us antarctic search for meteorites program .
he told the bbc that the methods used to get meteorites out of africa , particularly morocco and libya , were questionable .
he said private collectors were going to these countries to obtain the space rocks before selling them on to academic institutions .
" but its not clear that these meteorites came out of these countries legally , " he said .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- global warming helps arctic animals low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : americas front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's richard lister " this may be the most pristine wilderness in america " real 56k friday , 11 may , 2001 , 04:11 gmt 05:11 uk global warming helps arctic animals polar bears could be benefiting from global warming by the bbc 's richard lister in the alaskan arctic research in the american arctic has revealed that the polar bear and bowhead whale populations are booming after decades of decline , and part of the reason for that may be global warming .
although the long-term predictions suggest many arctic species could be jeopardised by any continued rise in temperatures , scientists think that at the moment some animal populations may be benefiting from a slightly warmer climate .
in the arctic desert of northern alaska , a tiny monitoring station is tracking the polar climate .
research over three decades shows the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere has steadily increased .
temperatures have also risen by a tenth of one degree every year since 1977 .
open seas dan endres , who runs the station , says even small changes can have a significant impact .
the alaskan sea ice " an increase of about two degrees -lrb- celsius -rrb- can mean as much as another month of open water , " he said .
no-one knows if the trend will continue .
if it does , the arctic ocean could be completely free of summer ice towards the end of this century .
that could devastate the wildlife that relies on it for hunting , breeding , and protection from shipping .
but for now , though , some species are positively booming .
the polar bear population on alaska 's coast has doubled since the ' 70s , thanks largely to a hunting ban .
researchers say they have never seen such big and healthy animals .
that may be because at the other end of the food chain , plankton are thriving in warmer waters .
good shape at the edge of the solid ice , the spring thaw is beginning and a whale count is under way .
research teams work round the clock monitoring the bowhead whales , which surface in open areas to breathe .
a research station in the arctic once hunted almost to extinction , this population is now increasing by up to 3 % a year .
retreating pack ice may also be helping them .
a team of researchers has also been monitoring the local polar bears from a helicopter .
they tranquillise , weigh and tag the animals .
george durner , from the alaska biological science center , says he has never seen the bears look in such good shape .
" the lengthening of the ice-free period may actually increase the amount of sunlight entering the ocean , triggering greater plant growth , plankton growth .
this is the foundation of the food chain out there , " he said .
fish eat the plankton .
seals eat the fish , and polar bears feed on the seals .
feeding opportunities scientists here are tracking the whales ' movement under the ice with special microphones .
further out where the sea ice is beginning to break up , another team is counting the whales as they come up to breathe .
craig george , one of the team leaders , says the bowhead whale population is now increasing by three percent a year , after being hunted almost to extinction .
he , too , says less ice may be helping them .
" retreating the pack ice a little bit gives greater feeding opportunities in the beaufort sea where they summer , " he said , adding : " retreating ice out of the canadian archipelago might allow them to enter areas where they have n't been for several thousand years . "
threatened way of life inupiat eskimos are preparing for a whale hunt .
they are allowed to catch a small number of whales for food , using traditional sealskin boats and harpoons .
a harpoon competition many hunters , like george brower , have had to be rescued in recent years , after the ice on which they set up camp sheared away from the land unexpectedly .
" our ice is changing out there .
it 's unstable .
my livelihood is off the ocean .
it 's a lifestyle that i would n't trade for the world , " he said .
he hopes to pass on his way of life to his sons and daughters , and hopes that they will carry on traditional ways .
but he says , " it 's getting more risky out there . "
limits to benefit some climate models predict that if warming continues at current rates , within 50 to 80 years there could be no arctic ice at all during the summer .
that would allow more shipping through the region , bringing noise and pollution , which could hurt the bowhead population .
researcher george durner says it would also be a disaster for the polar bears .
" if this ice-free period gets too long , then the period of time when polar bears can hunt for food becomes shorter and shorter because polar bears are so dependent on the ice platform for hunting for seals , " he said .
it could reach a point where the ice period may be too short for polar bears to get enough food .
if the current warming trend does take hold , the comeback being made by animals in alaska could soon be reversed .

bbc news online 's caroline ryan reports .
brad pitt and jennifer aniston are said to have chosen white gold rings when they married , and madonna is rumoured to have a platinum wedding ring .
these celebrities typify what jewellers call a " white wave " over recent years , with people preferring white metals over traditional yellow gold .
but the gold industry is staging a fightback .
' rebranding ' campaign the world gold council -lrb- wgc -rrb- is aiming to " rebrand " the metal so that it becomes first choice for jewellery buyers .
the wgc says the word gold has been overused , and linked to products ranging from " breakfast cereals to credit cards " .
a new advertising campaign will highlight the " warmth " of the metal , with the strapline " glow with gold " .
according to industry expert michael allchin , assay master for birmingham 's assay office , one of four in the uk that hallmarks precious metals , the shift to buying white metals is down to fashion .
" there has been a very big fashion move in the last five to six years in jewellery and watches to the white metals , " he said .
white metal is the 21st century colour daniel caspi merchant jeweller " the ' white wave ' has been very powerful .

" white metal is the 21st century colour and is currently very popular . "
marcus nysten : an exception to the rule but he said people still chose yellow gold for " traditional jewellery " such as wedding rings and gifts for special occasions .
fewer people are buying nine-carat gold , he added : " i think there 's a need to rehabilitate gold in the 18-carat to get the message across that that 's real quality . "
roger price , chief executive of the british jewellers ' association , which represents 700 manufacturers in the uk , said gold being sold was of better quality .
" the market has gone upmarket , with a move towards 18- and 40-carat gold . "
but there could be hope for the gold industry .

bbc news online 's caroline ryan reports .
brad pitt and jennifer aniston are said to have chosen white gold rings when they married , and madonna is rumoured to have a platinum wedding ring .
these celebrities typify what jewellers call a " white wave " over recent years , with people preferring white metals over traditional yellow gold .
but the gold industry is staging a fightback .
' rebranding ' campaign the world gold council -lrb- wgc -rrb- is aiming to " rebrand " the metal so that it becomes first choice for jewellery buyers .
the wgc says the word gold has been overused , and linked to products ranging from " breakfast cereals to credit cards " .
a new advertising campaign will highlight the " warmth " of the metal , with the strapline " glow with gold " .
according to industry expert michael allchin , assay master for birmingham 's assay office , one of four in the uk that hallmarks precious metals , the shift to buying white metals is down to fashion .
" there has been a very big fashion move in the last five to six years in jewellery and watches to the white metals , " he said .
white metal is the 21st century colour daniel caspi merchant jeweller " the ' white wave ' has been very powerful .
people got fed up of gold . "
designer jewellery has also taken off , with people looking for something a little different .
modern look daniel caspi , managing director of davril diamond and merchant jewellers in london 's hatton garden , said people were choosing platinum and white gold for " everyday wear " .
" white metal is the 21st century colour and is currently very popular . "
but he said people still chose yellow gold for " traditional jewellery " such as wedding rings and gifts for special occasions .
fewer people are buying nine-carat gold , he added : " i think there 's a need to rehabilitate gold in the 18-carat to get the message across that that 's real quality . "
roger price , chief executive of the british jewellers ' association , which represents 700 manufacturers in the uk , said gold being sold was of better quality .
" the market has gone upmarket , with a move towards 18- and 40-carat gold . "
but there could be hope for the gold industry .
michael allchin said : " if you look at the fashion magazines , you 're now beginning to see gold coming back into fashion . "
one potential buyer interviewed by bbc news online is marcus nysten , a london banker looking for an antique gold necklace or earrings for his wife .
he said : " i find yellow gold suits the colours of white skin , but if you have on white gold or platinum on , the skin will look old . "

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- asylum seekers : new handcuff row low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 11 may , 2001 , 06:09 gmt 07:09 uk asylum seekers : new handcuff row many failed asylum seekers are being housed at cardiff jail bbc wales has learned that more failed asylum seekers from cardiff jail were taken from a prison van in handcuffs before undergoing medical tests .
the news comes in the wake of uproar last week when it was revealed that a group of 20 detainees had been taken to hospital for routine tuberculosis tests - and were kept in handcuffs until the tests took place .
william graham : appalled conservative welsh assembly member william graham , who revealed details of the first incident , has since discovered that 11 detainees experienced the same treatment on wednesday .
a spokesman for the prison service said that , in line with national policy , they were handcuffed for security reasons as they were taken from the prison vehicle to the hospital .
the handcuffs were , however , removed while the tests took place at cardiff royal infirmary .
this latest revelation will reawaken the controversy surrounding the treatment of asylum seekers being housed temporarily at cardiff jail .
human rights all have been refused permission to settle in britain , and are either awaiting deportation or appeals against deportation orders .
last week there were calls for an inquiry into the way the people were treated , amid suggestions that their human rights had been breached .
" it is inhumane and degrading and certainly contrary to the way we should be treating people , " said mr graham , one of the members for south wales east .
lawyers have already successfully argued for many would-be settlers to be released pending their applications to the home office , but want the policy of using prisons to be changed immediately .
cardiff prison is being used as a detention centre julian phillips , one of the lawyers representing asylum seekers at cardiff prison , described the incident as " a complete infringement of human rights " .
but , he added , it was not the fault of the prison service .
" the prison service have been told that they must keep them securely , and if they 're going to do that , they 're going to handcuff them , " he said .
" that 's not the issue - the issue is that they should n't be in prison in the first place .
policy attacked " they should be held in proper immigration detention centres where there are proper facilities for them . "
the first claims of mistreatment came just hours after an assembly minister attacked the home office policy of detaining failed asylum seekers in jail .
local government minister edwina hart said it was not appropriate for refugees to be kept under such conditions .
but she told ams in a statement that it was not possible to change the situation in wales so long as the assembly failed to have control over its own destiny .
detention centres mrs hart has since written to uk immigration minister barbara roche expressing her concern about allegations of " appalling " conditions in which 32 asylum seekers are currently being held in at cardiff prison .
up to 100 have been detained at the jail since february .
the home office plans to use prisons to detain up to 500 people until new dedicated immigration detention centres become available later this year .
mrs hart said she was concerned by claims about the diet and accommodation of the asylum seekers held at cardiff prison .

allen has filed a lawsuit against jean doumanian saying she and her production company had failed to give him regular and accurate financial information about his films ' earnings .
films in focus small time crooks sweet and lowdown celebrity wild man blues deconstructing harry everyone says i love you mighty aphrodite bullets over broadway the films include bullets over broadways and small time crooks .
a spokesman for ms doumanian has said the double oscar-winning director received all the money he was entitled to .
' saddened ' the court papers , filed at manhattan 's state supreme court , say that only the first three movies of the eight financed by ms doumanian 's company sweetland films had written agreements while the rest were oral .
the agreements , according to court papers , say allen 's company , moses productions was entitled to receive half the " adjusted gross proceeds " sweetland receives from the distribution of the films .
allen 's court papers say that because doumanian has given him and his company no financial information , he is unsure how much she might owe him .
he ended his agreement with her in march 2000 when he signed with dreamworks .

since then , total of nearly 800 former patients have joined legal action against the law in different parts of japan .
a health ministry official said earlier that no human rights violations had taken place , and the situation a leprosy patient faced was no different to an ordinary stay in hospital .
however , the presiding judge in the case said that it had been obvious since 1960 that the law was unconstitutional .
the amount of compensation fell far short of the plaintiffs ' demands .
they received just over $ 114,000 instead of the $ 800,000 requested .

their situation was no different from an ordinary stay in hospital health ministry official " i 'm so happy .

leprosy was medically recognised in 1960 as an illness which resulted from transmission of a rare virus which is not contagious , but highly effective medication had already been developed by the 1940s .
but the government kept up a pre-world war ii isolation policy , updating an earlier law in 1953 .
the law , which was repealed only in april 1996 , led to thousands of leprosy patients being moved into treatment centres .

greek company superfast ferries has docked a vessel in the forth port of rosyth , which it hopes will provide the service next year .
the company has been selected as the preferred operator for the service but a funding package has still to be agreed with the scottish executive .
a feasibility study by scottish enterprise concluded that a new service between scotland and europe was commercially viable .
mr burns : advance discussions the study showed that most scots would prefer to travel from a home port rather than the english port of hull .
a steering group was then set up to evaluate business plans from interested operators .
the greek-based company superfast ferries was chosen as the preferred operator of a new service linking rosyth in fife with a major port on the european mainland last september .
the aim is to have a daily ferry link for freight and passengers with a crossing time of around 16 hours to a port in belgium , the netherlands or france .
jobs boost it is estimated that such a service could create up to 1500 jobs and boost the long-term survival prospects of the rosyth yard .
it is also believed the superfast ferries firm will transfer one of their fleet of roll-on , roll-off vessels to scotland on a trial basis in the near future .
but as yet , the ferry company has still to agree a funding package for the service with the scottish executive and its economic development agencies .
alan burns of forth ports authority said : " today 's visit will allow us to amass considerable technical information that we require to achieve that .
" today also allows us to raise awareness of the project and where it currently stands and to hopefully advance our discussions with the scottish executive in terms of frieght facility grants . "

scientists in london have revealed that 40 times more people suffered deep vein thrombosis -lrb- dvt -rrb- after long-haul flights than previously thought .
but many of these clots are " symptomless " and do not go on to develop into larger and potentially fatal clots .
the family of emma christoffersen , 28 , from south wales , who died after a long-haul flight , have called for a public inquiry into deaths from deep vein thrombosis .
emma , from newport , collapsed and died minutes after flying back from from australia .
her parents john and ruth christofferson , have joined mps and medical experts in demanding an official government investigation into deaths caused by dvt - commonly known as " economy class syndrome " .
honeymoon relatives of thomas lamb , 68 , from cardiff , are suing an airline over his death , which happened after a blood clot formed during a flight to australia .
policeman john thomas , 30 , from cowbridge , outside cardiff , died last summer after returning from his honeymoon in florida .
the new research - published on friday in the medical journal the lancet - are bound to raise concern among passengers .
it has already provoked controversy with some scientists , who dispute the high number of cases found by consultant surgeon john scurr and his team .
it can affect anybody if they have the right risk factors research team head john scurr mr scurr , who said the study was a preliminary one , told the bbc he recommended passengers on long flights should wear compression stockings .
" it 's not an economy class problem , it 's not related to the back of the aircraft , it can affect anybody if they have the right risk factors , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" immobility predisposes people who are probably already at risk for other reasons , " he said , adding that very long bus or train journeys could present the same problem .
an international meeting of scientists , aviation experts and air authorities in march launched an investigation into the number of dvt deaths following long-haul flights .
relatives of 14 uk dvt victims have launched a multi-million pound law suit against the airlines concerned .
wearing special compression stockings , given out by some airlines , has been found to reduce the risks .
roger wiltshire , secretary general of the british air transport association told today " we accept there is a risk with immobility .
" that is why the airlines have done an awful lot in the past 12 months to improve the advice they give to passengers about exercise and sensible hydration in flight . "
assessment but he said it was not the responsibility of the airlines to provide compression stockings .
mr scurr , of the middlesex and university hospitals , london , said his team had used extremely sensitive ultrasonographic assessment which enabled them to pick up more cases .
his team studied over 200 passengers who had travelled on flights of eight hours or more .
half were given the special stockings and showed no symptoms - 10 % of the others did show clots in their calves .
airlines ' efforts " what we are doing is picking up the small clots , some will just go away , but others like seeds will germinate and become bigger clots . "
mr scurr said there was no-one who could not fly , even those who had previous problems .
he said following medical advice and using stockings should cut the risk of clots and that the airlines were working with scientists to cut risks .
mr scurr said : " the airlines have been working with us for some time now .
no risk for most ' " they are very familiar with these results and are giving passengers advice .
" for the majority of people , though , there is no risk . "
in a commentary piece also in the lancet , dr jack hirsh from mcmaster university in ontario , canada , said more detailed and extensive studies were needed before firm conclusions could be drawn .
" what is needed are rigorously designed and adequately powered studies to resolve the issue .
" it would be premature to legislate that airlines change the seating configuration or introduce other costly procedures until there is more information on the extent of the problem and on the effectiveness of much simpler preventative measures . "

his team studied over 200 passengers who had travelled on flights of eight hours or more .
half were given the special stockings and showed no symptoms - 10 % of the others did show clots in their calves .
airlines ' efforts " what we are doing is picking up the small clots , some will just go away , but others like seeds will germinate and become bigger clots . "
mr scurr said there was no-one who could not fly , even those who had previous problems .
he said following medical advice and using stockings should cut the risk of clots and that the airlines were working with scientists to cut risks .
mr scurr said : " the airlines have been working with us for some time now .
