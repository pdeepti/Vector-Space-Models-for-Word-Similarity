the team discovered a walled burial ground 322km -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- north-east of the mongolian capital , ulan bator , that contains at least 20 unopened tombs apparently connected with people of high status .
it is an exciting discovery because it 's located near where some other important events occurred in khan 's life professor john woods professor john woods , who directed an expedition organised by two amateur chicago historians , said he had high hopes the mongolian government would allow a full archaeological excavation .
by the time he died in 1227 - either from a fall from a horse or a wound , or both - genghis khan 's conquests had created an empire which stretched across asia from modern-day china to the caspian sea .
significant location " it is an exciting discovery because it 's located near where some other important events occurred in khan 's life , " said professor woods .
the site , near the town of batshireet in hentii province , may lie near khan 's probable birthplace , and also near where he was proclaimed emperor of all the mongols in 1206 .
professor woods has petitioned the prime minister and said preliminary work on the remote site near the russian border could begin in april .
legend has it that the servants that buried genghis khan were killed by soldiers , who were then themselves slaughtered in order to keep the location of his grave a secret .
professor woods said what is thought to be the unexcavated tomb of the soldiers is 50km -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- from what he believes is genghis khan 's burial site .
lawyer maury kravitz , an amateur explorer and genghis khan enthusiast who organised the trip called the discovery " the find of all finds " .
he speculated the site could present a massive treasure trove given the absence of the mongol leader 's spoils of war from the world 's museums .

the sale price is a quarter of the £ 180m that scoot paid to buy loot last july .
acknowledging the extent of its financial difficulties , scoot said the sale and a bridging loan would give it " sufficient working capital to trade beyond 27 august 2001 and at least until the beginning of october 2001 " .
it said the £ 10.5m loan from a subsidiary of daily mail & general trust will give it £ 7m of working capital after repayment of bank loans of £ 3.5m.
it will pay 7 % interest on the new loan .
us and pakistan loot kept " scoot and dmgt are in discussions regarding an ongoing commercial relationship between scoot and the loot business , " the online directory firm said .
for now , scoot will retain loot 's operations in the united states and pakistan but it said it is in talks to sell these publications .
it has already sold the indian version of the advertising magazine .
in july 2001 scoot , once at the forefront of international expansion via the worldwide web , said it would retreat to its core markets , shelving plans to expand into germany , spain and portugual .
the statement came a week after scoot chief executive robert bonnier resigned and the firm said it was to cut 285 jobs and implement a strategy shake-up .
at that time , the company said it hoped to operate at a profit by the end of 2002 .
scoot announced losses of £ 9.5m for the first three months of this year .
only business in profit the sale of loot uk seems unlikely to bring profitability any closer - it was the only business within scoot to run at a profit in the first three months of this year and increased its sales to £ 6.4m , up £ 800,000 on the previous three months .
furthermore , the sale price for loot was below the value analysts were putting on the business at the time of the restructuring announcement , when it was expected to fetch about 50 % of the purchase price .
scoot has already sold its 50 % stake in scoot europe to partner vivendi universal , the french media and utilities giant , for a nominal one euro -lrb- 62 pence -rrb- .

profits reported by britain 's biggest companies could be reduced by hundreds of millions of pounds because of changes to the way they account for pension costs .
leading pension consultants lane clark & peacock says changes to accounting rules could even force some companies not to pay a dividend .
the consultancy , whose clients include leading multinational corporations , says shareholders are being kept in the dark by at least eight ftse 100 companies , which are failing to disclose exactly what their pension schemes are costing them .
among ftse 100 companies , bat , celltech , ici , land securities , marconi , powergen , spirent and vodafone all gave too little information in their published accounts to assess their pension costs .
new standards but over the next two years all companies will have to disclose the true cost of their pension schemes .
a new accounting standard , known as frs17 , will require companies to work out their pension costs according to what the schemes ' assets - typically shares , gilts , property and bonds - are currently worth .
previously they were given much greater discretion on how they worked out what the assets were worth .
when the stock market slides - as it has in the past 18 months - that will force up pension costs .
that cost will then have to be deducted from the companies ' operating profits .
corporate resistance finance directors have strongly resisted the new standard because it is likely to create massive volatility in the profits companies report .
the cost of keeping up a pension scheme to british telecom last year was reported as £ 167m .
but under the new standard that cost would have been reported as £ 620m - more than three times as much .
alex waite , a partner at lane clark & peacock , said : " the change in the raw numbers can be enormous .
even for companies this size these are huge changes .
" and the problem is that few people yet fully understand the difference -lsb- the new standard -rsb- will make . "
in the worst case scenario , an otherwise profitable company could be forced not to pay a dividend .
liabilities if share prices fall and interest rates stay low , the pension costs will create a much bigger liability on a company 's balance sheet , reducing the total value of the company .
if that value is less than the funds paid in to the company by shareholders , directors will be unable to distribute a dividend .
while the amount pension schemes pay out to pensioners will stay the same , consultants fear that finance directors may switch to inferior types of pension scheme to prevent profits being hit .
several big companies , including bt , sainsbury and lloyds tsb have already stopped offering the best kind of pension scheme to new members of staff .
by consensus , the best schemes are so-called " final salary schemes " .
these guarantee to pay retiring staff a proportion of whatever their salary is when they leave work .
members of these schemes are promised an index-linked pension , guaranteed to be paid until death , worth up to two-thirds of their final salary - depending on how long they have worked for the company .
to get the maximum benefit , staff have to contribute to these schemes for 40 years .
safe and sound but unless staff are in a pension scheme for a very short time , these schemes are still overwhelmingly good value .
they are also secure .
if the stock market falls , the employer must still pay the pension because it is guaranteed .
the new schemes being introduced by bt , sainsbury and lloyds tsb guarantee nothing .
all the risk is borne by the member of staff .
if the stock market performs poorly , the employee 's pension will be worth less .
and recent research has questioned the benefits these schemes will deliver .
according to william m mercer , another international firm of pension consultants , the new schemes deliver poor benefits - even when staff save 10 % of their salaries .
and it is getting worse .
poor pensioners ten years ago , a pension saver aged 30 who set aside 10 % of their salary each year would get a pension worth 55 % of their salary on retirement at 65 .
but because of lower inflation and interest rates , savers can now expect much less than that .
a 30-year-old who started saving this year , again putting aside 10 % a year , would get a pension of just 24 % of their salary at retirement .
mercer 's says savers must put aside 15-20 % of their salary each year to arrive at a decent pension .
