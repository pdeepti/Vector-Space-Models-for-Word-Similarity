it is almost exactly 50 years since the un convention on refugees was signed , and the organisation says it is time to remember the millions of people around the world who have crossed international borders to escape persecution , war or disasters .
the term refugee is sometimes also used to describe people who are displaced within their own country .
the un secretary-general , kofi annan , describes refugees as the great survivors of our time - people who have persevered despite losing everything but hope .
according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees , more than 12 million people have fled across international borders .
if internally displaced people are included , the figure rises to more than 20 million .
the unhcr recognises that the best way to deal with refugees is to tackle the conflicts that caused many of them to flee .
but it argues that setting aside one day a year to focus on their plight will help them to be treated with more understanding and respect .
in recent years , the unhcr 's aid budget has fallen , partly because of donor fatigue .
the organisation wants governments to renew their commitment to the principle of asylum and give more money .

one idea with a lot of support is different pricing arrangements in different countries - high in rich countries , low in poor nations many developing countries hope that this meeting might eventually lead to changes in wto rules that would make it easier for them to get hold of cheap medicines .
drugs still covered by patents can be prohibitively expensive for patients in poor countries .
under present rules wto member countries - except for a few of the poorest ones - must protect the international patents on any products , including new drugs , for 20 years .
this means they have to pay whatever price the manufacturers demand .
the purpose is to allow the companies to recover the very high costs of developing new medicines .
but it means that prices are higher than they would otherwise be and patients in the poorer countries often can not afford the medication they need .
aids disease this is a particular problem in relation to hiv and aids , a disease which has hit the developing world very hard .
many medicines for the condition are still relatively new and under patent and therefore expensive .
most people in the developing world can not afford expensive drugs the issues were thrown into sharp relief in south africa earlier this year with a court case brought by a group of international drugs companies wanting to stop imports of cheap copies of their medicines .
in the event the companies abandoned their case under pressure of bad publicity .

the chairwoman , dame janet smith , a high court judge , has warned that she may not be able to rule in every case whether or not there is a cause for suspicion .
relatives want to discover how the doctor managed to get away with his killing spree for some 24 years .
dame janet smith : to investigate 466 deaths the inquiry is unprecedented in national health service and judicial terms .
an interim report is expected from dame janet within a year .
the first phase of her investigation will consider how many patients were murdered by doctor shipman , how he committed the murders and over what sort of period the killings took place .
harold shipman , now serving 15 life sentences in frankland prison in county durham , has made it clear he will not co-operate .
he could have been forced to appear , but dame janet decided it would serve no purpose .
horrific statistics there have been suggestions that the inquiry may want to interview his wife primrose .
she attended each day of her husband 's trial at preston crown court , but she has never spoken in public , or to police , about his crimes .
mrs shipman regularly visits her husband in prison and she was with him during the three years that he practised in todmorden in west yorkshire before he started working at hyde in great manchester in 1977 .
primrose shipman could give the inquiry an insight that no other investigation has managed to record .
the statistics of the gp 's murderous career are horrific and dame janet says the inquiry is charged with attempting " to put an end to the uncertainty that has prevailed for so long and has caused so much distress " .
shipman killed using diamorphine injections the deaths of 466 patients is the official starting point , but that figure may rise .
relatives of another 152 former patients , where there is very little evidence to assess , will also be contacted .
dr shipman was convicted of killing 15 patients using injections of diamorphine , better known as heroin .
inquests have decided that another 25 patients were unlawfully killed .
interim report once the first part of the inquiry is concluded , dame janet will examine the actions by organisations and individuals involved in the procedures and investigations that followed the deaths .
this is to discover how the doctor got away with it .
it means interviewing the medical practitioners dr shipman worked with , the coroners , the registrars and the police officers who had a role in certifying death and authorising cremation and reporting or investigating sudden deaths .
phase three of the inquiry will include recommendations for checks and balances , perhaps even legislation , that should ensure there could never be another harold shipman operating from a doctor 's surgery .
relatives of his victims fought hard for the inquiry to be heard in public and two large tv screens in the library in hyde will allow them to watch proceedings without leaving their home town .

the vatican never asked for such measures bishop stanislav shirokoradyuk bishop stanislav shirokoradyuk said some of the measures , such as a ban on carrying umbrellas , were excessive .
" ukraine 's security measures pass all bounds and sometimes recall an emergency situation , " he was quoted as saying .
the ukrainian police said they were banning umbrellas because they were easy to mistake for weapons .
they have advised people to wear transparent raincoats in the event of bad weather .
the authorities have distributed leaflets along the planned route of the pope 's tour urging local residents not to come out of their houses , and not to look out of windows .
but the organisers say the purpose of the pope 's visit , which begins on saturday , is to meet ukrainians , not to avoid them .
" in the entire world , law enforcement and security agencies implement their functions to help people meet the holy father , but in ukraine they understand it in a different way , " bishop shirokoradyuk said .
up to two million people are expected to attend the pope 's services in kiev and lviv .
the pope 's visit to the predominantly orthodox former soviet republic has sparked much controversy .
the visit is strongly opposed by the russian orthodox church , which complains that roman catholic missionaries are encroaching into traditionally orthodox countries .
demonstration earlier this month around 2,000 people staged a demonstration in the ukrainian capital , kiev , in protest against the visit .
demonstrators waved placards demanding that the visit should be cancelled .
but a recent survey showed most ukrainians in favour of the pontiff 's visit .
more than 30,000 police officers will be on duty during the visit , which begins on 23 june .

the country exported 80.1bn yen more goods than it imported last month , japan 's finance ministry said , reporting the 11th successive decline , year-on-year , in the country 's trade balance .
the slump was attributed to falling foreign demand for electrical machinery and semiconductors , two of the sectors which powered japan 's development in the second half of the 20th century into a major industrial power .
and the data will heighten concerns that japan , which has struggled for a decade to shrug off economic stagnation , is poised to re-enter recession .
economic performance , or gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , figures released last showed that japan 's economy shrank by 0.2 % in the first three months of the year .
recession is technically defined as two successive quarters of economic contraction .
japan 's economics minister heizo takenaka is expected later this week to present an official outlook predicting near zero growth this year , compared with current official forecasts of 1.7 % .
long-term trend monday 's report revealed that the level of imports to japan jumped 14 % in the first quarter , while exports fell 0.9 % , continuing a long-running trend .
but while economists have blamed much of the long-term decline on the weakness of the domestic economy , the growing willingness of japanese firms to shift production abroad to cut costs is also seen as key .
the level of the decline in the trade surplus is likely to accelerate efforts by the us to help japan return to growth , and help the world economy pull out of a slowdown .
washington and tokyo are to hold talks later this year on bad loans held by japanese banks , telecoms deregulation , competition policies and direct investment .
the talks would represent a sea change in the attitudes of us politicians , who a decade ago held concerns over the relative strength of japan 's exporters .
" it is certain that us interest in trying to contain japan 's strong economy up until the early 1990s is now shifting to how to help a weak japan , " japan 's asahi newspaper said .
