however there are fears that this year 's main rally in the capital , harare , could descend into violence .
recent weeks have seen self-styled war veterans , who were responsible for the invasions of white-owned farms , intervening in labour disputes on behalf of urban workers .
the war veterans say they want to replace the existing trade union leadership , and plan to join the workers ' demonstration .
about 5,000 members of the zimbabwe congress of trade unions are expected to march from the centre of harare to a rally in one of the city 's stadiums .

with both trade unionists and war veterans planning to attend the rally the fear is that the battle for the hearts and minds of zimbabwe 's workers could result in physical confrontation .

a federal judge subpoenaed mr menem to appear before a tribunal on 13 july .
we will triumph ... lies have short legs carlos menem the charges relate to weapons and ammunition being illegally sold to croatia during a un arms embargo , and ecuador during its border war with peru .
the flamboyant former president denies any wrongdoing , and his supporters have backed him publicly in demonstrations in the argentine capital , buenos aires .
however , state prosecutor carlos stronelli said : " there is sufficient evidence to warrant interrogating him as ' head of the illicit association ' . "
' a sinister web ' mr menem told reporters that the move was " a sinister web woven by certain sectors of the argentinas political community " .
he added : " we will triumph .
lies have short legs . "
if found guilty , the former president - who served from 1989 - 1999 - could face up to 10 years in prison .
the weapons sales were allegedly carried out through secret decrees authorising sales to venezuela and panama - which has no army - which were eventually re-routed to war zones in croatia and ecuador .
' boost for democracy ' the federal judge 's decision follows allegations of mr menem 's involvement made last week by a private lawyer .
the local media have called the decision without precedent in argentina , and some politicians have praised the move as a boost for democracy .
" i congratulate the judge and the prosecutors because they could be starting a process that sweeps argentina clean of institutionalised corruption , " said independent congresswoman alicia castro .

at least two police officers and a protester died when thousands of supporters of deposed president joseph estrada tried to storm the building but were beaten back by security forces .
i thank all the troops who have been protecting me and the republic president arroyo calm has now been restored .
police and soldiers fired volleys of shots into the air , as well as teargas and water cannon to disperse the crowds , who threw rocks at them .
the demonstrators are demanding the resignation of mrs arroyo and the release of mr estrada , who was arrested last week on corruption charges .
he has called for calm , but has defended the actions of his supporters , saying they were defending the country 's constitution .
rebellion mrs arroyo , however , said unnamed political opponents were using the protests to try to unseat her .
mrs arroyo warned demonstrators against violence " the vandalism , robbery and injury and deaths are the work of these politicians , " she told the nation in a televised address shortly after riot police beat back crowds trying to scale the palace gates .
" they planned to bring down the legitimate government so they could set up their own junta . "
mrs arroyo announced a state of rebellion , which allows her to call in the armed forces .
the army says it will do what it takes to defend her government .
it was the second time in as many nights that mrs arroyo has alleged a coup is in the making .

at one point marchers drove a dumper truck through lines of riot police , forcing them to drop their plastic shields and scatter .
several thousand protesters were still outside the palace as the president made her address .
the march on the palace began from a manila religious shrine about 15 km -lrb- nine miles -rrb- away , where tens of thousands of mr estrada 's supporters have been holding a protest vigil since his arrest six days ago .
jailed estrada was moved into a high security cell they moved into manila 's financial district on sunday following calls from one of mr estrada 's sons to " show the ruling classes that we filipinos have the right to rule " .
leading the protests , his son joseph victor ejercito told the bbc the march to the presidential palace had not been organised , but the people were " mad " and could not be stopped .
the jailed former leader is now staying at a special police camp in santa rosa laguna province 50 km -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- south of manila where a special detention centre has been constructed for him .

at least two police officers and a protester died when thousands of supporters of deposed president joseph estrada tried to storm the building but were beaten back by security forces .
i thank all the troops who have been protecting me and the republic president arroyo calm has now been restored .
police and soldiers fired volleys of shots into the air , as well as teargas and water cannon to disperse the crowds , who threw rocks at them .
the demonstrators are demanding the resignation of mrs arroyo and the release of mr estrada , who was arrested last week on corruption charges .
he has called for calm , but has defended the actions of his supporters , saying they were defending the country 's constitution .
rebellion mrs arroyo , however , said unnamed political opponents were using the protests to try to unseat her .
" the vandalism , robbery and injury and deaths are the work of these politicians , " she told the nation in a televised address shortly after riot police beat back crowds trying to scale the palace gates .
" they planned to bring down the legitimate government so they could set up their own junta . "
mrs arroyo announced a state of rebellion , which allows her to call in the armed forces .
the army says it will do what it takes to defend her government .
it was the second time in as many nights that mrs arroyo has alleged a coup is in the making .
philippine immigration officials barred at least two current generals and two senators linked to mr estrada from leaving the country following the rioting .
as clashes raged outside the malacanang palace , mr estrada was flown from a military hospital to a maximum security detention centre outside the capital .
he is in custody facing a charge of economic plunder which carries a possible death sentence .
tense night the bbc 's damian grammaticas in manila said up to 20,000 protesters clogged the streets leading to the palace at the height of the standoff .
do n't shoot the people , they are unarmed joseph estrada they refused to disperse despite warning shots , teargas and the deployment of marksmen and military helicopters .
at one point marchers drove a dumper truck through lines of riot police , forcing them to drop their plastic shields and scatter .
several thousand protesters were still outside the palace as the president made her address .
the march on the palace began from a manila religious shrine about 15 km -lrb- nine miles -rrb- away , where tens of thousands of mr estrada 's supporters have been holding a protest vigil since his arrest six days ago .
they moved into manila 's financial district on sunday following calls from one of mr estrada 's sons to " show the ruling classes that we filipinos have the right to rule " .
leading the protests , his son joseph victor ejercito told the bbc the march to the presidential palace had not been organised , but the people were " mad " and could not be stopped .
the jailed former leader is now staying at a special police camp in santa rosa laguna province 50 km -lrb- 31 miles -rrb- south of manila where a special detention centre has been constructed for him .

the two sides have been locked in last-ditch talks to avert a strike for two weeks , with the writers ' guild of america 's members threatening to walk out .
if negotiations over repeat fees and creative input do not yield an end to the dispute , writers will strike when their contracts expire at midnight on 1 may .
but the guild has not yet applied for a vote of its rank-and-file members - a necessary step before any strike can take place .
film and tv production has dried up in the us and film studios are winding down before the possible industrial action .
there has been a media blackout throughout the latest round of talks , but rumours of a possible settlement have surfaced .
the guild told members to expect a " last , best and final offer " before the deadline .
residual payments the two sides could choose to extend the talks on a day-by-day basis .
writers and producers are said to be $ 100m -lrb- £ 70m -rrb- apart in negotiations over payments for residuals - the money they receive when their work is repeated on cable tv and in foreign markets - and payments from video and dvd sales .
los angeles mayor richard riordan last week suggested bringing former us senator george mitchell , who helped broker a peace deal in northern ireland , as mediator .
but a source close to the talks said : " there 's no discussion of bringing in anyone to play that role . "
' intense activity ' those who work at the planning stage of production are feeling the pinch .
everyone from grips and cameramen to truck drivers and caterers will have little to do if no films or tv shows are being made .
" i 'm just sitting here looking at the telephone , " said jeffrey olan , co-owner of rainbow casting .
but there has been a period of intense production activity leading up to the deadline .
studios have been rushing though television pilots , turning out extra episodes of established series and pushing through ultra-fast production schedules on movies .
but the films under threat because of the strike include basic instinct 2 , indiana jones 4 and quentin tarantino 's kill bill .
hollywood is also awaiting negotiations between the screen actors ' guild and the studios about the actors ' contract , due to expire on 30 june .
the screen actors ' guild has decided not to set a start date for negotiations until the writers ' guild concludes its current round of talks .
but sag officials met recently to approve the proposals it plans to bring to its own negotiations .
the last strike by hollywood writers , in 1998 , lasted exactly five months .
a strike could cost los angeles ' local economy almost $ 6.9bn -lrb- £ 4.7bn -rrb- and put 100,000 jobs at risk if it lasts for five months or more , according to a study commissioned by mayor riordan .

the sinn fein northern ireland minister for education gave a draft written submission to the inquiry , hearing evidence in the guildhall in derry , on monday .
in it he dismisses suggestions that there were up to 34 untraced wounded and dead on bloody sunday , including ira gunmen - a theory being pursued by lawyers representing most of the soldiers who were involved in the shootings .
in his statement mr mcguinness admits that he was second-in-command in the ira in derry at the time of bloody sunday on 30 january 1972 , when paratroopers fired on a civil rights march killing 13 people .
sinn fein sources have said , however , that mr mcguinness will not provide the tribunal with the identities of other ira members or discuss the roles they played during that time .
a date is yet to be fixed for mr mcguinness 's appearance in the witness box at derry 's guildhall , but it is likely to be within the next few months , once he meets inquiry lawyers .
' no ira weapons ' mr mcguinness will tell the tribunal that there were no ira weapons stored at or near rossville flats , where several people were shot by paratroopers .
the paratroopers told the first inquiry , which was conducted by lord widgery shortly after the shootings , that they had been fired on by ira gunmen from the flats before they opened fire .
the sinn fein minister says there was no movement of weapons in the bogside for any purpose before or during the civil rights march .
the inquiry will also hear of an ira meeting that took place as the events of bloody sunday were unfolding .
' army trap ' the ira leader in the city and martin mcguinness met other volunteers to discuss what reaction the ira should make to the shooting .
the education minister will tell the inquiry that " a critical and difficult decision had to be made " not to carry out reprisals against the security forces .
mr mcguinness is expected to say that the ira volunteers concluded that the army 's actions should be allowed to stand in the full gaze of the media .
according to his account , the ira believed that the army was attempting to draw it into a trap and it was accepted that it would be a serious mistake to take weapons to the scene of the shootings .
mr mcguinness also denies claims made by an mi5 agent , codenamed infliction , that he admitted firing a shot from the rossville flats in the bogside which precipitated the entire episode .
a sinn fein source added : " martin mcguinness will strongly assert his view , which is shared by the people of derry , that the murders on rossville street were a calculated act of revenge and part of the deliberate strategy to crush increasing nationalist and republican resistance . "
mixed reaction mr mcguinness 's decision to provide his testimony is a breakthrough for the tribunal , which has been pursuing him and other republicans for the past three years to establish what they were doing during the civil rights demonstration in the bogside .
the move has been welcomed by relatives of those killed and wounded by the army and by northern ireland secretary john reid .
however , hard-line unionists have said he should face criminal charges - or at least questions about ira murders and other actions beyond bloody sunday .
the bloody sunday inquiry was established in 1998 with lord saville of newdigate in the chair .
it has been sitting in public for the past year and is expected to run for another two years .
