the dounreay particles advisory group was set up to trace the source of the particles which have been found near the caithness nuclear plant and estimate the scale of the problem .
but the group 's first report has revealed that the system being used is incapable of discriminating between naturally occurring radiation and radioactivity from nuclear hotspots .
the group has praised the substantial progress being made at the plant .
campaigners have criticised the group but nuclear campaigners said it does not go far enough .
the continuing discovery of particles on the site foreshore , a local beach and the seabed has been a thorn in the side of management at dounreay .
the advisory group set up to help trace the source and the scale of the problem has praised efforts made to date .
but it said improvements must be made in offshore work .
its report said the equipment surveying the seabed could not discriminate between the natural radiation and radioactivity from hotspots .
clean-up call dounreay , which is operated by the uk atomic energy authority , said it is already investigating the use of updated techniques .
it has agreed to respond positively to the group 's recommendations .
but scotland against nuclear dumping has criticised what it sees as the advisory group 's failure to put any pressure on the ukaea to actually start cleaning up the seabed .
twelve particles have been found close to dounreay since 1983 .

the housing trends bulletin says that just over 11,200 people applied for help between july and september - a drop of 7 % on the previous year .
the fourth successive fall in the number of applications was welcomed by scottish social justice minister jackie baillie .
a spokeswoman for the homeless charity shelter also welcomed the slight dip , but said it could not be seen as a trend .
she acknowledged that government policies had helped - but asked how many people were eventually found permanent homes .
the latest housing trends bulletin , which was published on thursday , contains details of families with children living in temporary accommodation for the first time .
according to the bulletin , there were 4,078 households living in such accommodation at the end of september last year - a rise of 2 % on the previous year .
this includes hostels and bed and breakfast establishments .
of those households , just over 1,600 included dependent children - accounting for almost 40 % of the total .
the fact remains that , despite all the hype and spin , homelessness rocketed to record levels under labour keith harding , tory msp there were 11,204 homeless applications recorded in september 2000 , compared to 12,007 the previous year - a fall of 7 % .
seventeen local authorities reported a drop in applications , including aberdeen , fife and glasgow - which has the largest number of applications in scotland .
ms baillie said : " tackling homelessness remains a top priority for the scottish executive and i am optimistic that the steps we have taken and the funds provided are beginning to have a positive effect .
" and we will ensure that our policies are targeted to deliver long-term and sustainable solutions to the scourge of homelessness .
" our pledge is to ensure that no-one has to sleep rough by 2003 .
that is why we have invested £ 42 million in the rough sleepers initiative over a five year period . "
but the scottish tories ' local government and housing spokesman , keith harding msp , said : " the fact remains that , despite all the hype and spin , homelessness rocketed to record levels under labour .
failing the homeless " all this from a government that promised to do everything in its power to end the scandal of homelessness .
" things have got worse , not better , during labour 's tenure in office . "
earlier this year shelter said the rough sleepers initiative was failing homeless people in edinburgh .
a report said heroin use among homeless people in the capital had doubled in a year and said there were 105 fewer hostel beds than in 1997 .
a spokesman for edinburgh council was " surprised " by the criticism and said the initiative had been a great success .

the package of proposals have been put together in a bid to save 6,000 steel jobs across the uk - with around 3,000 of them in wales .
thursday 's meeting has been arranged by euro mp glenys kinnock and aims to highlight the priorities of the steel industry in wales .
mrs kinnock lived for many years amongst steelworkers and their families when her tredegar-born husband neil was mp for islwyn .
the most recent rescue package - presented to management by steel union officials on tuesday - included an offer to pay part of the steelworkers ' wages until market conditions improved .
part of the money would come from union funds , with the rest being provided by the welsh assembly and the european union .
on wednesday , prime minister tony blair pledged to do everything in his power to help save steel jobs .
no consultation the anglo-dutch company announced in february that it would have to slim down its workforce in the uk .
politicians were furious that there had been no prior consultation , and mounted a series of unsuccessful bids to make the company change its mind .
but earlier this week , unions were celebrating something of a breakthrough .
they met management at the corus headquarters in london to present them with a rescue plan - and emerged from the talks more optimistic about the future .
their major coup was to get the company to agree to forming a working party to discuss proposals contained in the plan .
they include an aid package worth up to £ 90m - most of it going towards helping to reduce corus 's wage bill .
some of the money would come from the public purse in the form of training grants , and the rest would be made up from union funds .
speaking at the house of commons on wednesday , mr blair applauded the efforts of union leaders who presented the steel giant with a rescue package and persuaded it to join a joint working party to discuss alternatives to axing the jobs .
we will certainly examine carefully the proposals that have been put forward by the trade unions and management for this specific help with training prime minister tony blair mr blair told mps on wednesday : " we stand ready to help in any other way that we can with those people , unfortunately several thousand who face losing their jobs .
" i pay tribute to the way that the trade unions have put together their package .
" they have done it in a highly responsible way , a commercially sensitive way , and i hope the company listens to them , we certainly will . "
the working party will meet over the next few weeks to work on proposals aimed at saving the jobs .
passionate attack mr blair added : " we will certainly examine carefully the proposals that have been put forward by the trade unions and management for this specific help with training . "
he was responding to denis macshane , labour mp for rotherham and chairman of the steel group of mps .
mr macshane had earlier launched a passionate attack on the tories for " butchering " britain 's steel industry for 20 years .
mr macshane said : " as our nation 's hearts go out to farming communities , can we spare a thought for the 6,000 steel workers ' families who face great misery without a peep of sympathy from the party opposite or their string-pullers in the press . "

the government in pakistan , which is suffering a severe drought , has asked scientists to look at the possibility of melting glaciers to provide water .
the chairman of the flood commission said it was one option they were examining although there were many potential pitfalls .
pakistan has suffered a drastic fall in its annual rainfall and the harvest is expected to be extremely poor this year .
pakistan has had droughts for the last three years for the past three years pakistan has suffered from a drought but this year the situation is desperate .
scientists are examining all possible options to provide some relief to farmers .
one proposal involves melting part of the glaciers in the northern region by spraying on charcoal , which raises the temperature of the ice .
destabilising effect however , the chairman of the federal flood commission , riaz ahmad khan , said the proposal was at a very preliminary stage and they were simply looking into which other countries had tried the method .
he said that , even if they went ahead with the plan , it would have limited application and they would have to be careful not to cause environmental damage or destabilise the glaciers .
there have also been suggestions that lasers could be used to melt the ice .
however experts say even if the plan proves to be feasible it would only provide a short-term solution to the continuing drought .
situation worse this year aid agencies say rainfall is down more than a third and snowfall has been poor .
last year there was also a drought but a bumper harvest helped the country to pull through .
this year the situation is far worse , many farmers are in debt , their cattle have died and there is little pastureland .
aid agencies plan to carry out a survey of the worst affected areas to ascertain the extent of the crisis .
