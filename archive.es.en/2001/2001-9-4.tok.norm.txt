the couple were wading in surf off a beach near avon , a remote town along north carolina 's outer banks barrier islands .
it was the second fatal shark attack off america 's east coast in two days - a boy was killed at virginia beach some 217 kilometres -lrb- 135 miles -rrb- further north on saturday his father managed to fight off the shark , but the boy died from the loss of blood .
the couple were attacked at about 1800 -lrb- 2200 gmt -rrb- as they waded between 20-40 feet -lrb- 6-12 metres -rrb- from the shore , near a sand bar .
surgery the woman received serious injuries to her lower torso , dr seaborn blair at the avon medical center said .
she has been flown by helicopter to the sentara norfolk general hospital in virginia , where she is in a critical , but stable condition in intensive care after undergoing surgery for her wounds , medical officials said .
the couple have not yet been named , but they are believed to both be russian nationals living in the washington dc area and to be in their 20s .
the beaches along the outer banks , a popular holiday destination , remain open , and officials planned to fly along the coastline on tuesday to monitor shark activity in the area .
torn artery on saturday , 10-year-old david peltier , was attacked as he surfed with his father and brothers at sandbridge beach in virginia .
the shark tore a 17-inch gash in his left thigh and would not release him until his father hit it repeatedly on the head .
the father then carried the boy ashore , but the wound had severed an artery and he died hours later from loss of blood .
the attack had occurred in just four feet of water some 50 feet from shore .
packed beaches both fatal attacks have fallen on the labor day holiday weekend when the beaches are packed with tourists .
in a similar shark attack on the florida coast in july , eight-year-old jessie arbogast lost an arm and most of his blood .
he survived , but remains in a light coma due to brain damage .
the international shark attack file of the university of florida has reported 40 known shark attacks worldwide this year , none of which were fatal until now .
of the 40 known attacks , 37 were in the united states and 28 were in florida waters .

prime minister lee han-dong and 21 other cabinet members tendered their resignations to allow president kim dae-jung a free hand to reshuffle his administration , the premier 's office said .
a major cabinet shake-up had seemed inevitable after members of the governing coalition voted on monday with the opposition against the unification minister , lim dong-won .
the vote - passed by 148 votes to 119 - came just hours after north korea had made an official proposal to seoul for a resumption of talks between the two countries .
china 's president jiang zemin , on a visit to north korea , has declared support for such a move .
lim dong-won is a key figure in promoting seoul 's " sunshine " policy aimed at constructively engaging the north .
he said he would tender his resignation on tuesday .
policy undermined the bbc 's caroline gluck in seoul says the vote is not legally binding but it will increase pressure on president kim dae-jung to dismiss his minister .
that would throw the " sunshine " policy into disarray .
the inter-korean dialogue has been frozen for the past six months , with north korea unhappy with the tougher line coming from the bush administration in washington .
south korea 's main opposition party , the grand national party , said mr lim 's approach to north korea had failed .
it had called on him to take responsibility for a controversial visit to north korea last month by a delegation of more than 300 south korean civic leaders .
seven of the delegates were later arrested and charged with violating south korea 's anti-communist national security law , which bans activities praising the communist north .
mps sceptical mr lim , a former head of the national intelligence service , is a close confidant of the president .
our correspondent says many of the national assembly members feel that rapprochement with the north has been costly and brought little benefit to the south .
the no-confidence vote is also a blow to president kim 's shaky minority coalition government .
his key ally , the small conservative united liberal democrats , had earlier announced it would support the vote .
north and south korea have technically been at war for more than half a century , as no peace treaty was signed at the end of their 1950-53 conflict .

there has been a marked increase over the past year in the number of ballots for industrial action and the number of days lost to strikes , solicitors at dla said .
the trend reflects a shift in the balance of industrial power from bosses to unions , the survey said .
and most unions surveyed forecast a rise in industrial , said dla , warning that industrial relations in the uk are set to face a " bumpy ride " .
" while we do not envisage anything like a return to the environment of the 1970s and 1980s , it is clear that unions have recovered some of the influence lost during the thatcher years , " said david bradley , the report 's author .
union mergers while union power dwindled during the 1990s with declining membership , the formation of " superunions " through a series of recent mergers has created organisations with huge industrial clout .
the amalgamated engineering & electrical union -lrb- aeeu -rrb- and the manufacturing , science & finance union -lrb- msf -rrb- merged in april to creates the uk 's second biggest union after unison , itself formed through merger .
and there has been some evidence of a rise in the membership of unions , which currently represent about 30 % of employees .
but the trades union congress denied that monday 's survey heralded a new period of industrial discontent .
" this alarmist survey is more about a firm of lawyers touting for business than an objective look at industrial relations , " a tuc spokeswoman said .
" the truth is that for every day lost through industrial action in 2000 , 54 days were lost in 1984 . "
firms hit by strike action in the last few months include south west trains , carmaker vauxhall , and post office operator consignia , which in june warned that jobs would go unless industrial relations improved .

the two sides are expected to discuss the continuing violence in the middle east , ways of increasing economic cooperation , and russian arms sales to iran .
the visit is first and foremost an acknowledgement that russia is playing a new role in the middle east - one that is not a carbon copy of the old pro-arab role played by the soviet union .
under president putin , russia wants stronger links with israel as well as with the palestinians and the arab states .
it wants to play a role in middle east diplomacy , and resents the notion that the only big outside player is the united states .
and it also wants ties with both iran and iraq - regardless of how controversial this is in both israel and the united states .
arms to iran the israelis have noticed a new even-handedness in moscow 's approach to the israeli-palestinian issue .
russia has for some months aligned itself with the position taken by both the united states and the european union , in calling for a ceasefire to be followed by implementation of the mitchell plan - the proposals put forward by the former american senator george mitchell .
but equally mr sharon is only too well aware that his visit to russia nearly overlapped with that of the iranian defence minister , admiral ali shamkhani .
this is a sharp reminder of what is , from an israeli point of view , the unacceptable face of moscow 's new activism in the middle east .
israelis are not impressed by russia 's assurances that it 's ready to supply iran only with defensive , rather than offensive , weapons .
the iranian defence minister , who postponed his visit at the last minute so that he would not be in moscow at the same time as mr sharon , is reported to have a shopping list that includes russian warplanes , attack helicopters and anti-aircraft missile systems .
one russian commentator sees his country 's relationships with israel and iran as an example of the " promiscuity " of russian foreign policy .
radical islam mr sharon wants to persuade president putin they face a common threat from what israel regards as " international islamic terrorism " .
for israel , he will argue , the threat comes from the islamic groups hamas and hezbollah ; whereas for russia it comes from muslims fighting russian forces in chechnya .
and both countries , he will add , face a common threat from the worldwide network of islamic militants run by osama bin laden , the saudi-born dissident based in afghanistan .
but president putin sees things differently .
he is unwilling to put all radical muslims in the same basket .
for the israelis , two other factors make this much more than a routine visit .
immigrants mr sharon is accompanied by his trade and industry minister , dalia itzik , and he clearly wants to boost economic co-operation between the two countries .
secondly , israel is already home to more than a million russian jews , who have become an important part of israeli life - and israeli politics .
many of them would like to see closer ties between moscow and the jewish state .
moreover , according to the israeli press , mr sharon has set himself the strategic goal of bringing another million russian jews to israel over the next 15 years .
this is an ambitious aim , given the current level of violence in the middle east and the preference of many russian jews to emigrate to the west rather than to israel .

some of mexico 's leading sugar producers , including the leading consorcio azucarero escorpion -lrb- caze -rrb- and grupo azucarero mexicano -lrb- gam -rrb- , could go out of business as a consequence of losing their operating facilities , traders predicted .
the intervention is seen as the most dramatic move on the part of the government since former president ernesto zedillo bailed out the country 's banks following the 1994 peso devaluation .
but the government insists it merely aims to rescue an industry in crisis .
us import restrictions mill owners ' debts have ballooned over the last two years as they have geared up production ahead of an envisaged opening of the us markets .
in no way are we talking about a government rescue president vicente fox but the us has failed to lift import restrictions and the mill owners have thus been left with massive debts both to the government , private lenders and mill workers .
" this was a situation we could not allow to continue , " said finance minister francisco gil at a news conference .
free market mexico insists that the re-nationalisation is not contradicting the country 's free-market philosophy .
the alternative would have been to continue to funnel more resources into these failing mills finance minister francisco gil " in no way are we talking about a government rescue -lsb- of the sugar mills -rsb- or the injection of funds , " said president vicente fox to the televisa network .
mr fox , speaking ahead of this week 's talks with the us president george w. bush , said he would request an increase of its imports quota from the current 116,000 tonnes .
for sale the government wants to sell the privatised mills to either national or foreign investors and will spend $ 327m to prepare for such a sell-off .
until then , the mills will be run by a newly created state-owned company .
" i think the government is going to have to sell the mills very quickly , " said one trader .
" it does n't have the money to operate them and they are n't generating profits " .
the international food giant cargill is seen by analysts as a likely buyer .
privatised the mills were privatised in the 1980s in a drive to improve efficiency and modernise the way they were run .
