the lone wolf , nicknamed martin by local animal rights groups , has been offered political asylum in neighbouring sweden if he can make it to the border .
norwegian authorities ordered the controversial cull after complaints from farmers that martin and the rest of his pack were preying on their animals .
but the hunters had to put away their rifles at midnight , after officials turned down a request for an extension to the deadline for the end of the licenced hunt .
the hunt - which has taken place during the past two months near the south eastern town of koppang - has sparked an outcry in norway and abroad .
' sheep killers ' animal rights groups say the slaughter amounts to a crime against nature , and that the true wolf population is a fraction of the officially stated 100 animals .
the hunters - equipped with helicopters and snowmobiles - managed to do away with nine wolves , but not norway 's increasingly famous lupine houdini .
the wolf has been named martin after martin schanche , a veteran norwegian rally driver - one of the wolf 's most ardent defenders .
thanks to heavy falls of snow and rain , the elusive martin managed to slip through the net and disappear without trace .
the operation is estimated to have cost taxpayers 3 million kroner -lrb- $ 331,200 -rrb- - about $ 36,000 for each wolf killed .
a successful reintroduction programme begun in partnership with sweden in the mid 1990s has seen wolves return in increasing numbers to their traditional habitats .
however , although they only account for a fraction of norway 's livestock deaths , officials argue that the growing wolf population means their numbers need to be kept in check .
