however , the files dispel the widespread view that one of hitler 's closest allies , gestapo chief henrich muller , survived world war ii and went on to work for the cia .

a us justice department spokesman , eli rosenbaum , said the files demonstrated that the real winners of the cold war were nazi war criminals .
other declassified documents give more background information on key nazi figures , and a report which suggests that adolf hitler 's own doctor thought the fuhrer was insane .
mr rosenbaum said many nazi war criminals " were able to escape justice because east and west became so rapidly focused after the war on challenging each other that they lost their will to pursue nazi persecutors " .
he deplored the cia 's use as intelligence sources of war criminals such as klaus barbie , the infamous " butcher of lyon " .
barbie was eventually convicted of crimes against humanity by a french court .
rabbi marvin hier , founder of the simon wiesenthal centre in los angeles , a jewish human rights organisation , said the publication of the cia material was " long overdue " .
one cia document says that in 1937 , hitler 's doctor thought he noticed growing signs of insanity in the nazi leader before the start of world war ii , and predicted he could become " the craziest criminal the world ever saw " .
later that year , the doctor said " the swing towards insanity " seemed to have taken place .

mr waldheim , a former president of austria , was barred from entering the us in 1987 after an investigation of his wartime activities as a german army lieutenant in the balkans .
the file on mr waldheim suggests that the cia knew little about him and that neither the us state department nor other government agencies that had an interest in his appointment to the un asked for a background check on him when he was a candidate for the job .

the national congress of indigenous peoples , which represents most of mexico 's 56 ethnic groups , said the proposals ignores the demands of the zapatistas .
the bill was one of mr fox 's first acts as president the zapatistas have made the enactment of constitutional reform a key demand for returning to peace talks that have been stalled since late 1996 .
last month , the rebels , led by subcomandante marcos , staged a nationwide tour to lobby for the bill receiving massive popular support .
a watered-down version of the bill was approved by the senate on wednesday - but it was modified version of the one sent to congress in december by president vicente fox .
objections the fox bill proposed changes to seven constitutional articles , two more than in the modified initiative .
but the indigenous organisation said on friday that the legislation being debated by the deputies failed to recognise the right of mexico 's ethnic groups to their territories and natural resources .
indigenous groups says the bill fails to recognise their right to their territories they say the bill does not reflect the agreement reached between the government and the zapatista rebel movement in 1996 .
some lawmakers have also raised objections to the indigenous rights bill , who say granting autonomy to indigenous communities could create indian territories and a possible " balkanisation " of mexico .
other constitutional changes involve autonomy in areas such as culture , community and law enforcement .
conditions met sending the rights bill to congress was one of president fox 's first official acts after taking office .
his government has met many of the other conditions set by the rebels for returning to peace talks .
these include the withdrawal of government troops from seven military bases in rebel territory - completed last week - and the release of zapatista rebels from the nation 's jails .
that task is almost complete .
the zapatista national liberation army -lrb- ezln -rrb- rose up in armed revolt in the southern jungle state on 1 january 1994 , to champion the rights of mexico 's 10 million mostly marginalised indians .

a political storm blew up after mr lynch had the £ 145,000 job offer withdrawn four days after he was unveiled by scottish enterprise minister wendy alexander and board members .
mr lynch 's contract was withdrawn after it emerged he intended to continue a part-time executive role with essex air cargo company , global supply systems .

it is thought the former bbc and british airways executive may take legal action against the board .
the statement from visitscotland , which had the unanimous backing of the board , said : " the board of visitscotland regrets the events which led to the offer of the post of chief executive to mr roderick lynch .
" at this time the matter is in the hands of the board 's lawyers . "
the statement continued : " the board of visitscotland regrets the problems that have occurred and are determined to learn the lessons and move on to a more productive and exciting future .
' recovery plans ' " the staff at visitscotland are maintaining their professional commitment to the recovery plans for scottish tourism and the provision of information to the industry and the visitor .
" our immediate priority is to ensure that the recovery plans are implemented successfully .
" as a matter of urgency , we shall renew our search for a chief executive and believe that a candidate with the credentials we seek can , and will , be found .

the board said the launch next week of a major campaign to promote short breaks in scotland was " a sign of our determination to move on " .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- estrada heads to new jail low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : asia-pacific front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's simon ingram in manila " police chiefs feared if he remained in the capital it would be over-run by his supporters " real 56k saturday , 28 april , 2001 , 08:54 gmt 09:54 uk estrada heads to new jail estrada supporters have vowed to continue their protests former philippines president joseph estrada has been undergoing medical checks before being transferred to a special maximum security detention centre , 70km south of the capital , manila .
he was flown out by helicopter from police headquarters in manila , where he has been held with his son jinggoy since their arrest on corruption charges on wednesday .
police requested the transfer amid fears that security could be jeopardised by thousands of mr estrada 's supporters mounting an around-the-clock vigil close to where he was being held .
estrada 's new cell is said to be more comfortable his supporters have vowed to maintain their protests until his successor , gloria arroyo , steps down and mr estrada is reinstated .
mrs arroyo has broken her silence about the situation , warning in a national broadcast that the armed forces are prepared to meet " any challenge to the constitution " .
estrada supporters say he is the victim of an injustice orchestrated by the country 's political and economic elite .
the bbc 's simon ingram in manila says mr estrada 's imprisonment has polarised filipino society , with many people of poorer urban areas never having lost faith in their former president who presented himself as a champion of the oppressed .
mr estrada , once a film star , denies charges of corruption .
he is to be tried for economic plunder , a crime which allows no bail and is punishable by death .
improved facilities mr estrada 's lawyers had requested that he be put under house arrest - but the court rejected his plea .
the lawyers opposed mr estrada 's transfer , saying that he could be attacked in transit .
police feared the jail would be stormed and estrada freed but police told a special anti-corruption court hearing that they feared mr estrada 's supporters would storm the camp crame police headquarters and release him .
the rally has ebbed and flowed in size , but at its height has drawn several hundred thousand protesters .
our correspondent says the former president himself is likely to welcome the improvement in his physical surroundings .
the authorities say his new cell will be larger and more comfortable than his previous one - television footage showed it had large beds , television , desk space and other facilities absent from his first police cell .
steps to jail 17 jan : impeachment trial collapses 20 jan : estrada toppled following mass protests 2 march : supreme court rules against estrada 19 march : estrada appeals 3 april : supreme court strips him of immunity 4 april : charges formally lodged 10 april : second bid to overturn supreme court ruling fails 16 april : arrested on lesser charges and bailed 25 april : arrested on plunder charge alleged to have illegally amassed more than $ 80m while in office , mr estrada is the country 's first president ever to be jailed on suspicion of corruption .
the plunder charge is the most serious of a number filed against him , but analysts say it is unlikely the death sentence will be imposed .
the indictment came after the supreme court unanimously rejected his appeals against a ruling that stripped away his presidential immunity .
mr estrada was forced from power in january after the army backed mass street protests sparked by the collapse of a six-week impeachment trial over the corruption allegations .

he was flown out by helicopter from police headquarters in manila , where he has been held with his son jinggoy since their arrest on corruption charges on wednesday .
police requested the transfer amid fears that security could be jeopardised by thousands of mr estrada 's supporters mounting an around-the-clock vigil close to where he was being held .
his supporters have vowed to maintain their protests until his successor , gloria arroyo , steps down and mr estrada is reinstated .
mrs arroyo has broken her silence about the situation , warning in a national broadcast that the armed forces are prepared to meet " any challenge to the constitution " .
estrada supporters say he is the victim of an injustice orchestrated by the country 's political and economic elite .
the bbc 's simon ingram in manila says mr estrada 's imprisonment has polarised filipino society , with many people of poorer urban areas never having lost faith in their former president who presented himself as a champion of the oppressed .
mr estrada , once a film star , denies charges of corruption .
he is to be tried for economic plunder , a crime which allows no bail and is punishable by death .
improved facilities mr estrada 's lawyers had requested that he be put under house arrest - but the court rejected his plea .
the lawyers opposed mr estrada 's transfer , saying that he could be attacked in transit .
but police told a special anti-corruption court hearing that they feared mr estrada 's supporters would storm the camp crame police headquarters and release him .
the rally has ebbed and flowed in size , but at its height has drawn several hundred thousand protesters .
our correspondent says the former president himself is likely to welcome the improvement in his physical surroundings .
the authorities say his new cell will be larger and more comfortable than his previous one - television footage showed it had large beds , television , desk space and other facilities absent from his first police cell .
steps to jail 17 jan : impeachment trial collapses 20 jan : estrada toppled following mass protests 2 march : supreme court rules against estrada 19 march : estrada appeals 3 april : supreme court strips him of immunity 4 april : charges formally lodged 10 april : second bid to overturn supreme court ruling fails 16 april : arrested on lesser charges and bailed 25 april : arrested on plunder charge alleged to have illegally amassed more than $ 80m while in office , mr estrada is the country 's first president ever to be jailed on suspicion of corruption .
the plunder charge is the most serious of a number filed against him , but analysts say it is unlikely the death sentence will be imposed .
the indictment came after the supreme court unanimously rejected his appeals against a ruling that stripped away his presidential immunity .
mr estrada was forced from power in january after the army backed mass street protests sparked by the collapse of a six-week impeachment trial over the corruption allegations .

scottish trade unionists want an international ban on use of the fibre and full compensation for victims .
the report shows the scale of the problem across scotland and highlights west dunbartonshire as having the worst death rate per head of population from asbestos .
many became ill years after they came into contact with asbestos in shipyards and factories and it has been predicted the number of deaths will double by 2020 .
proud heritage the naturally-occurring fibre was often used as a fire retardant , but it causes the rare cancer of the lung , mesothelioma , as well as other forms of the disease .
stuc general secretary bill speirs said : " scotland 's proud heritage as a shipbuilding and manufacturing nation has , unfortunately , had a terrible down side in the thousands upon thousands of workers and their families who have suffered and died through exposure to asbestos .
" the stuc is 100 % committed to working alongside the tuc to ensure that every victim receives full compensation for their suffering , and future generations do not suffer in the same way as those who went before . "
the stuc is calling for a global ban on asbestos , a public register of the asbestos which is still in so many buildings and more help for suffers , including full and fair compensation .
shipbuilding firms asbestos has been outlawed across the european union for two years but the stuc says more needs to be done to help victims and prevent people in countries where it has not been banned from being exposed to the fibre .
the fight for compensation for victims hit problems when the company handling their claims - chester street insurance holdings - went into liquidation earlier this year .
the insurance company , which provided insurance to clyde shipbuilding firms such as john browns , said it could not pay claims worth up to £ 100,000 to scottish shipyard workers .
it is estimated up to 5,000 ex-shipyard workers could be suffering from asbestos-related diseases .
insurance company clydebank is the town with the highest death rate from asbestos poisoning in the uk .
clydeside action on asbestos says it is going to fight the insurance company all the way .
it says chester street has transferred its assets and then deliberately gone into liquidation .
asbestos-related diseases can take 30 years to develop and doctors have warned the number of deaths from these illnesses has not yet reached its peak .

monica coghlan , 50 , died from her injuries on friday after a car crash in scammonden , near huddersfield , on thursday afternoon .
her blue ford fiesta car was struck by a jaguar allegedly stolen by a man who had earlier made an armed raid on a chemists in the birkby area of huddersfield .
a 32-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and is in hospital with serious injuries , west yorkshire police said .
taxi driver ' threatened ' police said a man was brandishing what appeared to be a handgun during the raid .
he ran out of the shop carrying medical supplies and then allegedly threatened the driver of a white taxi parked outside .
lord archer 's trial is due to start next month the man climbed into the cab and drove off alone but was then in collision with a land rover on new hey road , police said .
following the collision , he allegedly forced his way into a jaguar car , which collided with the ford fiesta a short time later .
ms coghlan , 50 , was taken by air ambulance to the leeds general infirmary but died from her injuries on friday .
perjury charges the former prostitute was thrust into the limelight during jeffrey archer 's libel trial against the daily star newspaper in 1987 .
the multi-millionaire novelist and former tory party deputy chairman successfully sued the star after it ran an article saying he had slept with her .
but last year , lord archer was charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice in connection with the libel case .
he pleaded not guilty and his trial is due to start next month .
scotland yard confirmed that ms coghlan was not due to give evidence .
' devastated ' ms coghlan was one of seven brothers and sisters and leaves a teenage son , robin .
her nephew kevin , 20 , said the family was devastated by the death .
" we just ca n't believe what has happened .
everyone is really upset .
i do n't know how my cousin -lrb- robin -rrb- is coping with it because i have not seen him . "
during the 1987 libel trial , ms coghlan said one of lord archer 's business associates met her at london 's victoria station to pay her £ 2,000 .
lord archer said the cash handover had been a " lack of judgement " and he maintained he only paid the money to help ms coghlan escape hounding reporters by going abroad .
he sued the daily star for suggesting he had slept with her and won £ 500,000 in damages .
but the issue resurfaced in 1999 , when it was alleged that lord archer had persuaded a friend to lie for him during the trial .
the allegations were investigated by police and lord archer stood down as tory candidate for london mayor .

he wants to map all the remaining 334 jewish cemeteries in the czech republic and publish the archive for posterity on the web .
when i touch the weathered stones , i think of those who left their dead here jaroslav haidler relatively few jewish monuments have survived in what is now the czech republic .
the combined effect of jewish resettlements , world war ii and the communist era left many synagogues in ruins , turned into warehouses , or simply left to fall into disrepair , overgrown with weeds .
but some have survived and , like a secret garden , they are waiting to be found and understood anew .
the czech media have been highlighting the work of mr haidler , 43 , director of a theatre in north-western bohemia , who has made it his life 's work to do precisely that .
he learned hebrew to better understand the bible .
he was also interested in symbolism and began exploring jewish cemeteries to look for urobor , the symbol of passing time .
beauty and reconciliation he told bbc news online that he was then captured by what he found - beauty , reconciliation , silence and especially the spirit of togetherness and mutual responsibility - not only in life but also in death .
in 1999 , mr haidler learned that there is no register of czech and moravian jewish cemeteries .
only a few written documents and registers of jewish communities survive , as most were deliberately damaged during the war .
dr arno parik of the jewish museum in prague said that , although the documentation of the old jewish cemetery in prague began in the 19th century , nothing was added until the 1989 revolution , since when a few others had been documented .
the work is extremely time-consuming , as one has to clean the sometimes sunken or uprooted tombstones , take a photo , decipher the text and then translate it , he said .
jewish cemeteries in the czech republic 334 cemeteries remain many destroyed under nazism and communism very little documentation published many stones bear poetic inscriptions in hebrew mr hailder set out to create a comprehensive database .
" something or somebody was calling me , and that call was quite urgent , " he said .
" when i touch the weathered stones , i think of those who left their dead here and never thought that nobody would ever come back to the jewish cemeteries to visit them .
" nobody .
simply because there was no-one left . "
poetic inscriptions inscriptions on gravestones or matzevot can be very simple or they can become beautiful epitaphs , poetic stories about the departed 's life .
" they are also prayers to the almighty and tantczewa - a plea and a hope that the departed 's soul may be bonded into the bond of life , " mr haidler said .
they can tell us about the people , wars , epidemics , pogroms .
they make it possible for us to reconstruct our history , he added .
celebration of life " to me , photographing the gravestones and translating the texts feels like a loving celebration of life . "
all that has not been written in these stone archives perished uner the rule of brown evil jaroslav haidler these cemeteries are a tremendous cultural and spiritual heritage , he said .
and so an idea was born - to make all these riches available on the web as part of project keshet , which is hebrew for " rainbow " .
so far , mr haidler has been to about 200 cemeteries and documented 20 .
dr parik said said mr haidler 's project was extremely demanding for one person .
but he said that whatever he was able to do in his lifetime would be valuable and would create a living link to hidden and forgotten places .
it would also be a valuable source for further historic research .

the work is extremely time-consuming , as one has to clean the sometimes sunken or uprooted tombstones , take a photo , decipher the text and then translate it , he said .
jewish cemeteries in the czech republic 334 cemeteries remain many destroyed under nazism and communism very little documentation published many stones bear poetic inscriptions in hebrew mr hailder set out to create a comprehensive database .
" something or somebody was calling me , and that call was quite urgent , " he said .
" when i touch the weathered stones , i think of those who left their dead here and never thought that nobody would ever come back to the jewish cemeteries to visit them .
" nobody .
simply because there was no-one left . "
poetic inscriptions inscriptions on gravestones or matzevot can be very simple or they can become beautiful epitaphs , poetic stories about the departed 's life .
deciphering the hebrew inscriptions is painstaking work " they are also prayers to the almighty and tantczewa - a plea and a hope that the departed 's soul may be bonded into the bond of life , " mr haidler said .
they can tell us about the people , wars , epidemics , pogroms .
they make it possible for us to reconstruct our history , he added .
celebration of life " to me , photographing the gravestones and translating the texts feels like a loving celebration of life . "
all that has not been written in these stone archives perished uner the rule of brown evil jaroslav haidler these cemeteries are a tremendous cultural and spiritual heritage , he said .
and so an idea was born - to make all these riches available on the web as part of project keshet , which is hebrew for " rainbow " .
so far , mr haidler has been to about 200 cemeteries and documented 20 .
dr parik said said mr haidler 's project was extremely demanding for one person .
but he said that whatever he was able to do in his lifetime would be valuable and would create a living link to hidden and forgotten places .
it would also be a valuable source for further historic research .

" we do have good security at the base , but no security is impenetrable .
there will be a thorough investigation . "
the investigation will centre on how the woman managed to penetrate the security cordon which surrounds the home of britain 's nuclear submarine fleet .
after swimming for several hours she approached one of the berthed nuclear submarines and spray painted the side of the hull .
latest protest the woman was arrested within seconds of emerging from the water .
this is the second time in a month that female anti-nuclear protesters have breached security .

they managed to cut through a wire security fence before unfurling a banner which read : " women of the world unite for a world without war " .
in february politicians and church ministers were among 379 people arrested following a similar protest outside the naval base .
