his meeting with gordon brown and john prescott on monday comes after the capital 's new transport commissioner bob kiley delivered a damning verdict on the government 's public-private partnership -lrb- ppp -rrb- plan .
implementation of the ppp would be unsafe , inefficient and prohibitively expensive bob kiley mr kiley said talks about modernising the tube have ground to a halt because of the treasury 's unwillingness to shift from the plan .
he warned that ppp would prove more expensive and less efficient than simple government funding of the necessary investment in infrastructure - which he estimated at £ 500m to £ 700m a year .
' wizard of oz ' in a report compiled for london mayor ken livingstone , mr kiley said his proposals for modifying ppp had been rejected following intervention by the treasury .
he said the government had also gone back on an agreement made earlier this month .
mr kiley painted a picture of mr brown as " the wizard of oz " , pulling the levers behind the scenes to control mr prescott , who is officially leading the talks .
the commissioner - called in by mr livingstone to turn around the tube , after his success with similar networks in new york and boston - said what mr brown envisaged was essentially privatisation .
he said : " the ' fatal flaw ' is simply that the public will own the system but not control it .
" the result is a divided management structure that will leave the public managers with no practical means of effectively operating the transport system or ensuring the safety of its millions of daily customers .
" in short implementation of the ppp would be unsafe , inefficient and prohibitively expensive . "
' visible improvements ' earlier mr kiley told the bbc 's breakfast with frost programme that if he was allowed to start work on the tube , he could make visible improvements within two to four years .
but he hinted that if the government failed to budge from its opposition to a unified control of the system , he could walk away from the whole situation .
mr kiley said it was agreed on 2 february that transport for london and london underground would have " unified management of the underground " and the commissioner would " take the lead " in making this happen .
but he said that on 14 february he attended a meeting with government representatives who told him the private sector must control the three new companies being set up to provide and maintain infrastructure for the tube .
this situation was said to be " non-negotiable " .
mr kiley said he believed further talks under the 2 february agreement would be " fruitless " .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- ' tearaway ' brothers appeal over ban low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk politics front page world uk uk politics interviews business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's john thorne " it could open the doors to other appeals " real 28k monday , 26 february , 2001 , 06:51 gmt ' tearaway ' brothers appeal over ban the brothers were subject to an anti-social behaviour order three brothers are going to the court of appeal on monday to try and overturn a court order barring them from a housing estate in manchester .
sean mccann , 16 , and his younger brothers joseph and michael will claim the ban contravenes european human rights legislation .
last year the brothers were made the subject of one of britain 's first anti-social behaviour orders -lrb- asbos -rrb- , under new legislation brought in by the government to fight yob behaviour .
for the first time ever , the court of appeal is to move from london to manchester , to hear the teenagers ' pleas .
failed appeals their appeals to the the crown and high courts have already failed .
the brothers , who have legal aid , are asking the master of the rolls to overturn a court order barring them from beswick in east manchester .
for two years , the brothers are said to have created a catalogue of intimidation , burglary and theft on the housing estate .
greater manchester police dedicated hundreds of hours of detective work gathering evidence to obtain the ban .
if it is quashed , it could open the doors to appeals by the subjects of over 140 similar orders imposed on nuisance neighbours and troublemakers .
last june , home secretary jack straw told councils in england and wales to make more use of new powers to crack down on loutish behaviour and nuisance neighbours to help communities " run ragged " by anti-social behaviour .
speaking at a local government conference in bournemouth , he urged councils and the police to increase the use of asbos .
the orders first came into force in 1999 , but councils were at first reluctant to use them .
