rupert murdoch 's news corp dropped out of the running on saturday , after a gm board meeting failed to decide between the two competing bids .
if the deal is approved by regulators , it would give echostar a near monopoly over the home satellite business in the us .
the deal ends rupert murdoch 's ambition to create a global satellite television network , unless the regulator bars the tie-up between the two biggest operators in the us market .
echostar deal echostar will now have to convince hughes ' shareholders it has sufficient financing for the bid , which features a $ 5.5bn cash component .
echostar 's head charlie ergen has confirmed that two major banks are providing backing .
last wednesday , deutsche bank agreed to provide additional $ 2.25bn in financing for the bid , matching the contribution of ubs warburg , echostar 's financial advisor .
directv is the main satellite provider in the united states with 10 million subscribers , while echostar owns the second-ranked service , with 6.7 million subscribers .
news corp disappointed mr murdoch is reportedly angry about the time which gm took to make decision , which allowed mr ergen to improve his bid .
" we have no option but to withdraw immediately our fully negotiated and financed proposal , " said mr murdoch .
he added : " hughes would have been an excellent strategic fit for our global platforms , and we are disappointed with the -lrb- gm -rrb- board 's inaction " .
news corp had hoped to merge directv with its sky global network , creating a worldwide platform to distribute its huge portfolio of tv shows and films , and spin off the business as a separately-quoted company .
reaching 10 % of us homes , directv had a strong attraction fornews corp. warning signs news corp had been in on-off talks with gm since october last year and linked up with microsoft and liberty media , run by john malone , as its us partners backing the purchase .
then in august this year , echostar entered the fray .
the deal has been falling apart for a while and in early october mr murdoch acknowledged he remained only " 50-50 " confident that news corp would emerge the winner .
at a time when many media firms were warning that cancelled advertising after the terrorist attacks would hurt their profits , hughes reported 24.6 % revenue growth to $ 2.1bn for the three months from july to september 2001 .
directv attracted 425,000 new subscribers in that period and posted revenue growth of 18 % to $ 1.3bn.

she worked as a mail handler at the sorting office which processed the anthrax-contaminated letter sent earlier this month to senator tom daschle .
card appealed for people to be careful in washington , the us justice department is the latest official building to suffer traces of anthrax .
the bacterium was discovered in an off-site mail-sorting office in landover , maryland , which handles post addressed to attorney general john ashcroft .
the white house says there could still be undiscovered letters containing anthrax in the american postal system .
president bush 's chief of staff , andrew card , said : " there may be other letters that are stuck in the system ... but we are working hard to make sure that any contamination is confined and we can deal with it .
" our postal service and the fbi are working very hard to understand all they can and we are asking people to be very careful . "
mr card , interviewed on american television , defended the government 's handling of the anthrax outbreak , which has killed three people - two of them postal workers .
many postal workers are angry at the government 's response to the outbreak , saying there were delays in testing and treating staff after anthrax-laced letters surfaced .
" i think our government is working very well , " mr card said .
" this government is doing everything it can . "
improving condition the latest person diagnosed with inhalation anthrax is a middle-aged woman who worked at a mail sorting centre in hamilton , near the new jersey state capital , trenton .
mailrooms around the country are being sealed her condition is reported to be improving , five days after she first came under observation for suspected anthrax .
at least 11 other people have been infected with anthrax and thousands more have been tested or given antibiotics for the disease .
as well as sending mail to be sterilised in ohio , the postal service is spending $ 40m on eight electron-beam devices to sanitise letters and packages .

eight electron-beam devices will be used to sterilise mail the us supreme court has shut its doors and the nine justices are taking the antibiotic doxycycline , which health officials are now dispensing in place of ciprofloxacin , because it has fewer side effects .
mr card said authorities had so far been unable to identify the source of the anthrax , but suggested it had been developed in a sophisticated laboratory .
" this anthrax has been milled , it may have additives , " he said .
fbi and cia officials are now reported to believe the anthrax contamination is the work of extremists in the united states rather than terrorists abroad . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's duncan kennedy " the us supreme court building will be closed for the first time in its 66 year history " the bbc 's nick bryant " more anthrax tainted letters could still be in the post " the bbc 's steve kingston in washington " the 56-year-old woman diagnosed with anthrax is improving " see also : 28 oct 01 -pipe- americas latest us anthrax victim buried 27 oct 01 -pipe- americas anthrax found in congress offices 26 oct 01 -pipe- americas new anti-terror laws for us 25 oct 01 -pipe- americas cipro demand outstrips supply internet links : united states postal service the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top americas stories now : bush vows action after scandals ' white supremacists ' on trial in boston worldcom chiefs refuse to testify canada blazes send smoke south pentagon team to examine bomb error hundreds mourn la airport victims new hope for aids vaccine texas pleads for more flood aid links to more americas stories are at the foot of the page .

of the 5,000 people who are officially listed as dead or missing , fewer than 500 bodies , or more usually just body parts , have been recovered from the ground zero site where the twin towers collapsed .
i have an emptiness inside me that no material things can fill - i lost my husband and my best friend and my children lost their father philomena mistrulli without a body , it is difficult for the grieving relatives to come to terms with their loss and even harder for them to move on and continue with their normal lives .
" a natural death would have been easier to accept , " tim murphy told bbc news online outside the service .
his brother robert was a security officer on the 82nd floor when it was hit by a hijacked passenger plane .
" being that there 's no body , it 's difficult .
especially the way things happened on 11 september , it 's difficult to come to grips with , " he said .
after the sombre , multi-faith service which included stirring musical dedications by composer andrew lloyd weber and opera singers andrea bocelli and renee fleming , the new york authorities distributed small , wooden urns containing ash from ground zero to the victims ' families .
" it gives some semblance of closure .
you know it 's not your loved one , but it 's the earth and maybe some part of someone who was there , " said gabriel peluso , whose 47-year-old brother , anthony , was working on the 93rd floor .
as he spoke , he was holding a small black box containing the urn under one arm and a united states flag distributed by the red cross under the other .
" it 's another step in putting this behind you . "
irreplaceable but not everyone thought either the service or the urns helped .
philomena mistrulli 's husband , joseph , was a carpenter working at the windows on the world restaurant in the world trade center .
" i have an emptiness inside me that no material things can fill .
i lost my husband and my best friend and my children lost their father , " she said , on the verge of tears .
these were offices where people worked - yet you ca n't see even a piece of a computer , a chair , a desk , a filing cabinet michael skala " this is not closure to me , it just opens a wound .
each time i go to a memorial or open a piece of mail , it opens a wound .
there 's no time to heal .
i do n't think i 'll ever heal from this . "
while mr murphy appreciated the service , he was unhappy at only being able to see the place where his brother was killed and where his ashes probably still remain by official invitation .
" i think they should have let the families of the victims come down here as often as they want .
they let celebrities come here , i think the families should come here any time , " he said .
spectrum of emotions thousands of people from all over new york and beyond attended the service , forcing the work of digging up the debris and taking it for inspection by police officers to stop for the whole day - the first time the bulldozers have had such a long break in seven weeks .
however , pumps continued to spray water over the fires which are still burning deep underground , giving off plumes of smoke as the christian , muslim and jewish prayers were said .
the victims ' families arrived wearing black , most with a focused look in their eyes , but some broke down when they first saw the site where their husbands , wives , sons and daughters lost their lives .
they went through the whole spectrum of emotions during the day and even at any one time .
" i feel very bad , sad and proud - he was a fireman , " sobbed thomas pickford who lost his son , christopher , on 11 september .
icy wind many brought flowers and photographs of those who died , which they held aloft during the service in the weak autumn sunshine and icy wind .
some , but only a few , wore gas masks , despite recent reports in a local newspaper that the air in downtown manhattan contains toxic chemicals released by the collapsing twin towers .
the red cross distributed plastic bags containing paper tissues , a phone card and a memorial badge .
the tissues came in for some heavy use .
michael skala , who lost his brother john , a policeman , could not believe that all the signs of human life inside the skyscrapers had been reduced to composite , impersonal ash and debris .
" these were offices where people worked .
yet you ca n't see even a piece of a computer , a chair , a desk , a filing cabinet .
just rubble , " he said .
so many people came that some , including mr skala and his family , watched the ceremony on television in a nearby bar , the blarney stone , which until last week was only patronised by rescue workers as it is in a restricted zone .
" it was just too packed , " said mr skala .
" my mother is over 70 and she ca n't stand up on the streets , shoulder to shoulder , for 90 minutes . "
one of many memorials for once , the bar 's big screen television was not showing the sports channel , but a live transmission of the service .
even on television , the service helped the grieving family .
" it was really beautiful , " said mr skala .
for some victims , this was the first memorial service .
for others , especially uniformed officers , it was the last of several .
thomas kelly was a fireman who was buried underneath tower number one , which he had actually helped to build in 1973 while working as a pipe-fitter .
his family have already held a private service and another at saint patrick 's cathedral in central new york .
" this will be a final memorial , it will bring closure , " said his brother , bob kelly .
now that families have been given a physical symbol of their loss , their thoughts are turning to more permanent memorials .
michael skala said : " we have n't decided what to do with the urn yet .
we 're taking it day by day .
we may bury it but we 'll definitely get a tombstone with john 's name on it . "

of the 5,000 people who are officially listed as dead or missing , fewer than 500 bodies , or more usually just body parts , have been recovered from the ground zero site where the twin towers collapsed .
i have an emptiness inside me that no material things can fill - i lost my husband and my best friend and my children lost their father philomena mistrulli without a body , it is difficult for the grieving relatives to come to terms with their loss and even harder for them to move on and continue with their normal lives .
" a natural death would have been easier to accept , " tim murphy told bbc news online outside the service .
his brother robert was a security officer on the 82nd floor when it was hit by a hijacked passenger plane .
" being that there 's no body , it 's difficult .
especially the way things happened on 11 september , it 's difficult to come to grips with , " he said .
victims ' families received wooden urns containing ash from ground zero after the sombre , multi-faith service which included stirring musical dedications by composer andrew lloyd weber and opera singers andrea bocelli and renee fleming , the new york authorities distributed small , wooden urns containing ash from ground zero to the victims ' families .
" it gives some semblance of closure .
you know it 's not your loved one , but it 's the earth and maybe some part of someone who was there , " said gabriel peluso , whose 47-year-old brother , anthony , was working on the 93rd floor .
as he spoke , he was holding a small black box containing the urn under one arm and a united states flag distributed by the red cross under the other .
" it 's another step in putting this behind you . "
irreplaceable but not everyone thought either the service or the urns helped .
philomena mistrulli 's husband , joseph , was a carpenter working at the windows on the world restaurant in the world trade center .
" i have an emptiness inside me that no material things can fill .
i lost my husband and my best friend and my children lost their father , " she said , on the verge of tears .
these were offices where people worked - yet you ca n't see even a piece of a computer , a chair , a desk , a filing cabinet michael skala " this is not closure to me , it just opens a wound .
each time i go to a memorial or open a piece of mail , it opens a wound .
there 's no time to heal .
i do n't think i 'll ever heal from this . "
while mr murphy appreciated the service , he was unhappy at only being able to see the place where his brother was killed and where his ashes probably still remain by official invitation .
" i think they should have let the families of the victims come down here as often as they want .
they let celebrities come here , i think the families should come here any time , " he said .
spectrum of emotions thousands of people from all over new york and beyond attended the service , forcing the work of digging up the debris and taking it for inspection by police officers to stop for the whole day - the first time the bulldozers have had such a long break in seven weeks .
however , pumps continued to spray water over the fires which are still burning deep underground , giving off plumes of smoke as the christian , muslim and jewish prayers were said .
families were given mementoes of their loved ones the victims ' families arrived wearing black , most with a focused look in their eyes , but some broke down when they first saw the site where their husbands , wives , sons and daughters lost their lives .
they went through the whole spectrum of emotions during the day and even at any one time .
" i feel very bad , sad and proud - he was a fireman , " sobbed thomas pickford who lost his son , christopher , on 11 september .
icy wind many brought flowers and photographs of those who died , which they held aloft during the service in the weak autumn sunshine and icy wind .
some , but only a few , wore gas masks , despite recent reports in a local newspaper that the air in downtown manhattan contains toxic chemicals released by the collapsing twin towers .
fires are still burning deep underground the red cross distributed plastic bags containing paper tissues , a phone card and a memorial badge .
the tissues came in for some heavy use .
michael skala , who lost his brother john , a policeman , could not believe that all the signs of human life inside the skyscrapers had been reduced to composite , impersonal ash and debris .
" these were offices where people worked .
yet you ca n't see even a piece of a computer , a chair , a desk , a filing cabinet .
just rubble , " he said .
so many people came that some , including mr skala and his family , watched the ceremony on television in a nearby bar , the blarney stone , which until last week was only patronised by rescue workers as it is in a restricted zone .
" it was just too packed , " said mr skala .
" my mother is over 70 and she ca n't stand up on the streets , shoulder to shoulder , for 90 minutes . "
one of many memorials for once , the bar 's big screen television was not showing the sports channel , but a live transmission of the service .
even on television , the service helped the grieving family .
" it was really beautiful , " said mr skala .
for some victims , this was the first memorial service .
for others , especially uniformed officers , it was the last of several .
thomas kelly was a fireman who was buried underneath tower number one , which he had actually helped to build in 1973 while working as a pipe-fitter .

the group , which will include child welfare specialists , academics and legal experts , will meet at a seminar in edinburgh on monday .
it will examine how other legal systems around the world take evidence from children , before compiling a report with recommendations on how the system in scotland could be reformed .
children can give evidence by video link the charities involved , childline scotland , children 1st and nch scotland , believe changes to the law are overdue .
children 1st chief executive margaret mckay said : " being a witness in a court case of any sort is a stressful experience for adults , so imagine how it must feel for children and young people who have been physically , emotionally or sexually abused .
" practice in scotland flies in the face of most research on interviewing children . "
although some changes to the scottish legal system have been made , such as the use of video-links to enable youngsters to give evidence , the charities believe more needs to be done .
witness broke down among their suggestions are the establishment of a professional child witness service to take evidence from children , and the use of taped evidence so that the youngster does not need to be cross-examined .
the issue of child evidence was highlighted earlier this year when the trial of six men accused of sexual abuse collapsed at the high court in edinburgh when an eight-year-old boy broke down in the witness box .
the scottish executive has also announced that it is working on proposals to change the current system .
childline scotland director anne houston said : " we hear from thousands of children and young people each year who are being abused in some way .
" it is extremely painful for them to talk about what is happening .
" they need a system which is child-friendly and which encourages them to seek the support and safety they deserve .
" as adults , it is our responsibility to ensure such a system is developed in scotland . "

the problem facing fishermen has been how to catch more of these fish without catching cod at the same time .
the talks in brussels were seen as vital in helping gain agreement between fishermen , scientists and governments about catch limits and other measures to protect cod for next year .
cod stocks in the north sea have been at their lowest ever level .
only last week scottish fisheries minister rhona brankin conceded that the common fisheries policy was not working and said the scottish executive was working with westminster and brussels to develop better legislation for the seas .

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- schools face incomer pressures categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 29 october , 2001 , 07:03 gmt schools face incomer pressures schools report a ' transient ' roll of pupils a bbc wales investigation has discovered schools in north wales are struggling to cope with an influx of pupils with special needs .
the welsh language current affairs programme taro naw has seen a confidential report showing schools in north east wales having to deal with large numbers of incomers .
more than half the pupils in colwyn bay assessed for educational special needs in the last academic year had moved into the area in the last two years , according to the confidential report .
teachers are under great strain one former headteacher said he quit his post because of the problem .
he told taro naw that up to 130 incomers - many with complex problems - would arrive each year and in the same year about 120 would leave .
the programme 's findings are likely to further fuel the row over incomers to wales .
taro naw found that conwy 's education department has dealt with 35 children who moved into the county in the last 12 months with an lea statement declaring they had special educational needs .
this has cost the authority £ 160,000 .
it was also discovered that about the same number of pupils move into the area without statements each year , yet they also require special education .
these children are put in the same classes as other pupils until it is realised they need extra help .
there was a transient population of 25 % in the school brian morris , former headteacher it is claimed that this not only disrupts education for both sets of pupils but also takes weeks for the local authority to make the assessment , once a teacher realises the child needs special lessons .
the cost of making the assessment and providing the education then falls on the local authority .
the situation has become so bad that one north wales headmaster has quit his job partly because of the strain .
' transient pupils ' brian morris , previously head of christchurch school , rhyl , quit his job last year partly because of the problems .
he claims the influx of families with social problems moving into the area is putting a strain on education and teaching staff .
" there was a transient population of 25 % in the school , " he said .
" every year around 130 incomers would arrive - and in the same year about 120 would leave .
" the children came from birmingham , manchester , liverpool and warrington - a lot of them with complex problems ; a lot coming from broken homes .
" some of the incomers had drug problems and others had a suspicious interest in children . "

the welsh language current affairs programme taro naw has seen a confidential report showing schools in north east wales having to deal with large numbers of incomers .
more than half the pupils in colwyn bay assessed for educational special needs in the last academic year had moved into the area in the last two years , according to the confidential report .
one former headteacher said he quit his post because of the problem .
he told taro naw that up to 130 incomers - many with complex problems - would arrive each year and in the same year about 120 would leave .
the programme 's findings are likely to further fuel the row over incomers to wales .
taro naw found that conwy 's education department has dealt with 35 children who moved into the county in the last 12 months with an lea statement declaring they had special educational needs .
this has cost the authority £ 160,000 .
it was also discovered that about the same number of pupils move into the area without statements each year , yet they also require special education .
these children are put in the same classes as other pupils until it is realised they need extra help .
there was a transient population of 25 % in the school brian morris , former headteacher it is claimed that this not only disrupts education for both sets of pupils but also takes weeks for the local authority to make the assessment , once a teacher realises the child needs special lessons .
the cost of making the assessment and providing the education then falls on the local authority .
the situation has become so bad that one north wales headmaster has quit his job partly because of the strain .
' transient pupils ' brian morris , previously head of christchurch school , rhyl , quit his job last year partly because of the problems .
he claims the influx of families with social problems moving into the area is putting a strain on education and teaching staff .
" there was a transient population of 25 % in the school , " he said .
" every year around 130 incomers would arrive - and in the same year about 120 would leave .
" the children came from birmingham , manchester , liverpool and warrington - a lot of them with complex problems ; a lot coming from broken homes .
" some of the incomers had drug problems and others had a suspicious interest in children . "
headteachers in the area claim resources are being hit and teachers are leaving because of the problem .

opposition councillors have said that claims by bob phillips - former owner of the team - that he had been pressurised into surrendering the lease of the wales national ice rink should be the subject of an independent inquiry .
mr phillips became unpopular with ice hockey fans when he withdrew his backing for the devils - one of the uk 's most successful clubs - in the top flight of professional hockey last season .
they are now languishing in a part-timers league .
but mr phillips said he had been made a " scapegoat " by cardiff council .
he claims it had promised him a much bigger ice arena for the devils in an unbuilt £ 240m " sports village " in cardiff bay .
he has accused the council of reneging on that promise - and using its financial and legal muscle to make life difficult for him .
mr phillips added that the ice rink has been raided by large numbers of council officers conducting health and safety checks - although no shortcomings were found .
critical the council , he went on , is now planning to open a temporary open air rink over christmas - in competition to the indoor arena the least of is owned by mr phillips .
he also complained that a senior council officer is webmaster of a devils supporters ' site which has been consistently critical of him .
the council responded by stating that what the official did in his spare time was his own business .
earlier this month , ex-london knights coach chris mcsorley and his brother , nhl player marty mcsorley , were linked in a takeover of the club .
since news of the club 's demise in the spring , cardiff devils fans have staged protest against the club 's threatened closure .

the club is understood to have lost £ 250,000 this season on top of a £ 2.5m shortfall over the previous four seasons , with senior officials warning the losses were unsustainable .
the move to a bigger arena was to generate more gate receipts , with the national ice rink 's 2,700 seats making it the smallest capacity arena in the superleague .
the club 's management had looked at moves to nantgarw , north of cardiff , and even a new franchise in dublin .

trade statistics released at the end of last week show hong kong 's exports in september fell by more than 10 % compared with last year .
china 's continued growth is the only bright spot in the prevailing gloom , and there is a sense that asia in some ways is an economic hostage - that the united states must show signs of recovery and japan must carry out major reforms before things will improve for the region .

the new alliance with world 's biggest carrier mean the first of the new aircraft would be in service by as early as january , said qantas chief executive geoff dixon .
the aircraft will enable qantas to meet passenger demand after the collapse of ansett airlines , australia 's second largest domestic carrier , in september .

" american airlines will assist qantas with technical advice , simulator training for pilots , spare parts and engines , " mr dixon said .
