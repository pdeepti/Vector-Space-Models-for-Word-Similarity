at a meeting with king abdullah , the president reiterated his position that a return to arab-israeli peace talks depended on a cessation of violence , a policy hardly different from that of israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
" our country is very interested in working with all parties " in trying to get the opposing sides to " lay down their arms " , mr bush said during a photo session with the king in the oval office .
but he added : " first and foremost the violence must stop . "
bbc amman correspondent barbara plett says king abdullah shares egypt 's belief that only washington can persuade israel can make the kinds of concessions arab leaders think are needed for a settlement with the palestinians .
he has spent the last week lobbying political circles in the us for a return of washington 's hands-on approach to middle east peace as seen during the administration of former president bill clinton .
a senior us official said the two leaders discussed ways to bring israeli and palestinian security officials together for a second meeting as a way to reduce tensions .
shortly before his arrival in washington , king abdullah spoke of an " essential " us role and how he would discuss " how we can work together ... to restore calm and get the peace process back on track " .
after his meeting with mr bush , he said only : " i believe we 're both committed to finding peace and stability in our part of the world . "
economic help mr bush said his administration would get a free-trade agreement for jordan " one way or the other out of our congress " , a measure that correspondents say is vital to jordan 's hard-pressed economy .
key republicans in congress have said the agreement should be changed to make it more acceptable to us business groups .
the jordanian monarch is the second arab leader to meet mr bush , the first being president hosni mubarak of egypt .
there has been anger in some arab capitals that mr bush has so far avoided inviting palestinian leader yasser arafat to washington .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- mps call for royal business register low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk politics front page world uk uk politics interviews business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's john pienaar " it is a controversy that is still growing " real 56k labour backbencher , brian donohoe " i do n't think it is the type of business that royals should be involved in " real 28k wednesday , 11 april , 2001 , 04:42 gmt 05:42 uk mps call for royal business register countess of wessex and her husband prince edward nearly 60 mps - most of them labour - have signed a commons motion calling for the registration of the royal family 's business interests .
the move follows the resignation of the countess of wessex from her public relations firm over claims that she tried to exploit her position to win clients .
downing street - which has pledged 100 % support for the monarchy - has declined to comment on the motion .
we were all shocked at the revelations in the news of the world gordon prentice but culture secretary chris smith said members of the royal family should behave with " the highest degree of probity " .
he told the bbc : " the necessity of all of us , be we mps or indeed members of the royal family , to operate at all times with the highest degree of probity , is something that we all need to bear in mind . "
the commons motion was tabled by labour mp gordon prentice following uproar over comments made by the countess to an undercover reporter posing as a potential client .
the motion calls for the establishment of a royal register in line with similar rules covering the outside interests of mps .
it " applauds the decision of buckingham palace to consider issuing guidance on how the business affairs of working members of the royal family might be conducted in future " .
it urges the palace to consult mps on what guidance royals should be given .
and it also suggests that the commons select committee on public administration should conduct an inquiry and make recommendations .
gordon prentice : shocked by revelations the pendle mp has urged palace officials to invite comments from mps on any new rules but he also called on the public administration committee to review current practices .
it could then offer suggestions for change where appropriate , he said .
mr prentice said he had been dismayed by the reports concerning the countess of wessex .
" we were all shocked at the revelations in the news of the world , with sophie rhys-jones describing the budget , for example , as ' a load of pap ' .
" this is from a woman who gets £ 141,000 a year from the taxpayer and i just think that 's not on . "
reform the commons motion follows calls on monday from labour mps for a review of the monarchy .
tony wright , a senior labour mp and chairman of the commons public administration committee , called for major reform .
earlier , veteran mp tony benn took the opportunity to repeat his call for an elected head of state .
but downing street moved to end the speculation by saying tony blair was 100 % behind the monarchy .

both liveontheweb.com and entertainment network inc are petitioning the us government to put cameras in the death chamber on 16 may , the date mcveigh is due to be executed .
us federal officials have refused the requests , saying it has no plans to give any broadcaster access .
but both companies say banning the broadcast infringes rights to freedom of speech and both are now launching separate legal challenges to force the issue .
legal petition timothy mcveigh , the man convicted of placing the bomb that destroyed the oklahoma city federal building and killed 168 people , is due to die by lethal injection .
he will be the first person to be executed under federal , rather than state , jurisdiction for 37 years .
the 1995 bomb attack in oklahoma city was the worst ever terrorist attack on us soil .
liveontheweb.com and entertainment network have tabled separate requests to the us federal bureau of prisons for permission to broadcast the execution .
liveontheweb.com , which styles itself as the " people 's broadcasting network " , said showing the execution would be a deterrent to criminals and a milestone for freedom of speech and first amendment rights .
" we will not promote this as a pay-per-view event and will enact the strongest viewer discretion and age verification , " it said .
in response , the u.s. department of justice stated , " the federal bureau of prisons is not considering the broadcast of this execution or any other execution via the internet or any other broadcast medium . "
web watching entertainment network inc , which runs the pornographic voyeurdorm and dudedorm websites , said it would charge $ 1.95 -lrb- £ 1.40 -rrb- to watch the execution .
all proceeds would go to those injured , or the families of those killed , in the 1995 explosion .
" the government is sponsoring the killing of the human being who was responsible for this horrendous act , and we believe the people have an absolute right to witness this action , " said david marshlack , eni chief executive .
its petition that the us government is acting unconstitutionally in blocking the webcast is due to go court on 17 april .
no date has yet been set for the liveontheweb.com legal action .
any decision is complicated by the fact that this week us attorney general john ashcroft is considering a request from the families of those injured or killed in the blast to watch the execution via closed-circuit television .
around 250 people injured in the explosion , or who lost loved ones in the attack , have said they want to watch mcveigh die .
the terra haute , indiana , prison where mr mcveigh is due to be executed reportedly only has enough space for eight witnesses .
mcveigh has requested that his death be carried out in public saying it was not fair to put limits on the number of people that could watch his execution .

doctors decided to bring forward plans to screen all 15- and 16-year-old students after one 15-year-old showed signs of the disease .
dr philip monk , a public health consultant with leicester health authority , said screening of all pupils at crown hills would soon be complete .

dr monk said all staff at the school had also been invited for tests .
screening would also be offered to family and friends of those who had been diagnosed with the disease .
200 cases each year dr monk said there were around 200 cases of tb in leicestershire each year .
he said a six-year-old pupil of oakham school had died of the disease in october 2000 .
however , pupils at that school were not at risk .
the three establishments where screening will take place are wyvern school , hamilton community college and loughborough college .
all students will be screened at wyvern school and hamilton community college .
however , only selected screening will take place at loughborough college , where the students are older , and some are only part-time .

but he said the screening programme would be extended in light of the outbreak at crown hills .
he said mass screening was unnecessary , and would be unlikely to uncover significant numbers of cases .
he said : " this is an unusual outbreak , and clearly we need to get to the bottom of it , and then see what lessons there are .
" but at the present moment it does not appear that this is a situation that needs to be of concern to anywhere else in the country . "

on wednesday , it will consider whether to cut interest rates in the 12 countries that belong to the single currency .
european interest rates have been left unchanged at 4.75 % since october , while other major central banks have subsequently cut rates .
calls for a european cut have become increasingly loud during the past few weeks , first of all from no less a body than the international monetary fund and latterly from germany 's finance minister , hans eichel .
it is unusual for a finance minister to speak out against the independent european central bank , but mr eichel 's plea is a sign of just how desperately he believes a rate reduction is required .
he is understood to think that the ecb has taken far too long debating whether such a cut from the current level of 4.75 % is necessary .
dithering the european central bank could be accused of dithering in the face of a growing storm .
there is no doubt that the global economic slowdown is worsening , with america and japan now struggling .
only europe is left as an area of reasonable economic growth .
but even in europe there are problems .
the latest economic forecasts from germany 's six leading research institutes suggest that growth this year will be around 2.1 % - a sharp fall from the previous forecast of 2.7 % .
hints the ecb seemed to be hinting a few weeks ago that it realised a cut in rates was required to stimulate economic activity .
there were speeches from france 's central bank governor suggesting that inflation was no longer an obstacle to reducing rates , even though inflation remains stubbornly above the european central bank 's target of 2 % .
but following that speech , the ecb said it had been over-interpreted , and then came more speeches pointing out that the bank remains neutral on the question of whether interest rates should be cut .
the result is much confusion .
the financial markets do n't know what that the ecb is likely to do today at its meeting .
there 've been lots of clues that a cut could be on the cards but just as many urging caution .
ecb 's communications gap once again , questions have been raised about the bank 's communications policy .
a bank should always retain the ability to surprise but it must also lead the markets gently , always clear on roughly which way policy is going .
it is an area where the bank now appears to be failing miserably .
its most outspoken critics argue the bank still has plenty to learn about running an economy - even after almost three years in charge of europe 's most ambitious project , managing the single currency .
the european economy probably does , on balance , require an interest rate cut to keep growth up in the midst of a global downturn and if it does n't come at wednesday 's meeting there will be repercussions .
many on the foreign exchanges may once again decide to take out their frustration on the troubled euro , selling it as a way of telling the bank that it still lacks credibility as an institution responsible for guiding one of the world 's major economies .

the attorney general is now considering whether or not to bring contempt of court proceedings against the newspaper after the trial was halted at hull crown court .
leeds players lee bowyer and jonathan woodgate face a retrial in october after the judge dismissed the jury on monday saying the article could be prejudicial .
the jury had been considering charges that the two players and two other men had assaulted student sarfraz najeib in leeds city centre .
investigation launched the sunday mirror said in its statement : " we are currently seeking to establish the precise editorial and legal processes that were taken last week which led to the publication of the article in the sunday mirror .
" we would like to take this opportunity to express our deep regret about the subsequent chain of events . "
the judge dismissed the jury of seven men and four women after learning that some of them had seen the article .
a court order prevents the contents of the article from being reported . £ 8m trial cost defence lawyers did not oppose an application at hull crown court on tuesday to retry the case there on 8 october .
mr justice poole said the pair should be able to get a fair and unbiased trial .
there is likely to be a pre-trial hearing in september when defence teams are likely to oppose the retrial .
the crown prosecution service applied to have the accused retried after the collapse of the 10-week hearing , which has cost about £ 8m .
mr woodgate , 21 , mr bowyer , 24 , paul clifford and neale caveney , both 21 , all deny causing affray and grievous bodily harm with intent to sarfraz najeib in leeds city centre last january .
on thursday the jury at hull crown court cleared another leeds player , michael duberry , 25 , mr woodgate , mr clifford and mr caveney , of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice .
we would like to take this opportunity to express our deep regret about the subsequent chain of events sunday mirror neither footballer was in court on tuesday .
the director of public prosecutions , david calvert-smith qc , told a reporter on monday that a " cordon sanitaire " should be imposed by the press in such cases .
he said : " they -lrb- the press -rrb- should be particularly careful as the trial nears its end , when the jury goes into retirement . "
a statement from the attorney general 's office said he would take a decision as quickly as possible whether or not to begin proceedings against the sunday mirror .
mr clifford 's counsel , nigel sangster qc , said the re-trial would be " vigorously opposed " .
he said : " a fair trial before a jury with no preconceived views in this case is impossible . "

in 2000 , just 1,136 applications were received , in comparison to 2,280 this year , figures from the universities and colleges admissions service -lrb- ucas -rrb- showed .
there are some very successful uk higher education recruitment fares in china every year ucas spokesman there was also a 20 % rise in the number of students applying to the uk from india , from 629 in the year 2000 to 757 in 2001 .
the british government had been encouraging universities and colleges to recruit more students from overseas and many ran strong marketing campaigns , a spokesman for ucas said .
" there are some very successful uk higher education recruitment fares in china every year , which are very popular .
" the uk has a strong reputation in china and is continuing to open up to western influences , " he said .
' enriching student life ' british universities had much to gain from a rise in the number of foreign students , the spokesman said .
" having students from different cultures studying alongside each other helps to enrich student life .
" and there 's also a financial incentive , because these students pay the full tuition fees , " he added .
european downturn but the ucas figures also showed that - with the exception of spain , which saw a small rise in applications of 0.2 % on last year - the number of students applying from europe has dropped , as much as -29.9 % in the case of norway .

last month president bush said the us would not ratify the global climate treaty , the kyoto protocol .
the eu hopes to ensure the protocol comes into force ratified by enough countries to outweigh the us .

the dutch environment minister , jan pronk , who chaired the climate conference which broke down in the hague last november , has invited 40 of his counterparts to a meeting on the fringes of the csd session on 21 april .
the meeting is being described as " informal ministerial consultations " , but it is clear that it could decide whether or not the kyoto protocol has a future .

if president bush needs a reminder that the us itself will feel the effects of climate change , he will receive one this week .
on 13 april the us national science and technology council will publish a report reviewing the costs and benefits to the us of a warming world .
parts of the us , the report says , can expect higher farm yields .

fifty-one schemes around the country have halved the waiting time for first treatments and reduced waits for radiology by nearly two-thirds .
now the government is rolling the programme out nationwide in a bid to cut waiting times for all cancer patients .
under the nhs plan , the government said , by 2005 , no cancer patients should have to wait more than two months from gp referral to their first treatment .
this is good news as we know that treating patients sooner decreases anxiety , improves the patient 's experience and produces a better outcome professor mike richards , cancer " tsar " success stories included : at glenfield hospital , in leicester , staff were able to remove a three-week delay in breast cancer waiting times by re-designing their patient registration forms .
at university hospital , lewisham , staff have stopped giving bowel cancer patients two separate appointment days for tests - they said this cut patient anxiety and reduced the number of missed appointments by 15 % .
northwick park hospital and clinical research centre , harrow , cut its backlog of routine ct scans from 18 weeks to zero for lung cancer patients , by ensuring the scanner was used to full capacity .
the royal liverpool and broadgreen university hospitals nhs trust reduced a 12-week wait for an ultrasound for prostate cancer to just two weeks .
queen 's hospital , sidcup , has reduced waiting times for ovarian cancer test results by 72 hours by transporting specimens straight to the laboratory following theatre rather than waiting for collection the next day .
the cancer services collaborative programme was launched in november 1999 to try and find ways to cut waiting list times for cancer treatments .
cancer " tsar " professor mike richards said the pilot schemes had proved a great success .
he said : " waiting times for diagnostic tests which used to take months now take weeks or even just days by making practical changes .
" we want to see this extended to the rest of the country so that all cancer patients can benefit from such good practice . "
cancer " tsar " professor mike richards wants to see waiting times cut professor richards said speedier treatment for cancer patients would improve their chances of recovery .
" this is good news as we know that treating patients sooner decreases anxiety , improves the patient 's experience and produces a better outcome . "
professor david kerr , national clinical chair of the cancer services collaborative , said the scheme had shown how dramatic changes could be made with very little financial outlay .
" the main resource has been time and support .
" the cancer services collaborative has provided a forum for clinical teams from across the country to come together and to share how they deliver services .
" teams have tested ideas out with each other , learned from each other 's failure and plagiarised the changes that have worked . "
