the ep-3 surveillance plane parts were carried by a chartered russian antonov-124 cargo plane to dobbins air force base in georgia .
the 1 april collision and subsequent detention of the ep-3 plane and its crew on hainan island in southern china triggered a tense stand-off between the us and china .
the plane will now be inspected to see if it can be reassembled and returned to service .
" we 're fairly confident that the plane is salvageable , " said greg caires , a spokesman for the manufacturers lockheed martin .
the plane 's return may now pave the way for an improvement in china-us ties .
the impasse over the collision ended only after washington said it was " very sorry " that the pilot of the chinese jet had died and that the us plane had landed without permission .
passions cooled after the crew of 24 was released , but china refused to allow the plane to be flown off hainan island , though engineers said the plane could be repaired .
damage us navy experts estimate that structural repairs will take eight to 12 months .
the collision damaged two of the ep-3 's engines and one of its four propellers .
it also caused the plane 's nose cone to break off , and pieces of metal punctured parts of the fuselage .
us security personnel will also examine the plane , which was loaded with surveillance equipment , to assess what data the chinese may have obtained .
us officials have said the crew destroyed much of the plane 's surveillance equipment and erased sensitive data soon after landing .
but the pentagon has acknowledged that some secrets were lost from the plane .

new research suggests that even seemingly healthy animal clones may have subtle genetic abnormalities with unknown consequences .
this suggests that even apparently normal clones may have subtle aberrations of gene expression that are not easily detected in the animal clone rudolph jaenisch , whitehead institute for biomedical research the warning comes as a group that wants to clone a baby announced that it was close to achieving its goal .
the first human clone is likely to be produced " very soon " , the scientist leading the project told an american newspaper this week .
brigitte boisselier , the director of company clonaid , told usa today newspaper that the project was on schedule and the first clone would be produced in the near future .
but she refused to be drawn on when that was likely to be and what stage the project was at .
risky technology scientists say cloning techniques are still too underdeveloped to attempt on humans .
experience with animals has shown that most clone pregnancies fail , or result in offspring being delivered stillborn or deformed .
the new research , published in the journal science , attempts to explain why .
two leading animal cloning laboratories in the us used mice to investigate what goes wrong during the cloning process .
rudolph jaenisch , of the whitehead institute for biomedical research , cambridge , massachusetts , and ryuzo yanagimachi 's laboratory at the university of hawaii , honolulu , produced mice clones from embryonic stem cells - the " master " cells that go on to form all the different tissues in the body .
even seemingly healthy clones like dolly could have subtle genetic abnormalities they found that the mice clones had subtle differences in their genetic make-up .
something was going wrong in the regulatory process that controls whether certain genes are switched on or off in the cells used for cloning .
" this suggests that even apparently normal clones may have subtle aberrations of gene expression that are not easily detected in the animal clone , " said professor jaenisch .
the cloning expert warned recently that attempts to clone human beings at the current time were " dangerous and irresponsible " .
he was joined in his call by british colleague ian wilmut , one of the scientists who produced dolly the sheep , the first adult mammalian clone .
commenting on the new research , professor wilmut said it illustrated the dangers of " copying " people .
he told the bbc : " the most likely outcome of any attempt to do that would include late abortions , birth of children who would die , and worst of all the birth of children who would survive but would be abnormal . "
stem cell work he said the new work provided the first direct evidence that clones were genetically different from normal animals .
cloning is still a somewhat imprecise and variable procedure and this is the universal experience in terms of cloning mice , cattle , sheep and goats ian wilmut , roslin institute " cloning is still a somewhat imprecise and variable procedure and this is the universal experience in terms of cloning mice , cattle , sheep and goats , " he added .
" there is an unusual pattern of loss of foetuses and unfortunately the death of offspring that are produced by cloning .
" this is the reason why lots of labs , including our own , have called for a moratorium on the use of cloning with humans on safety grounds alone . "
professor wilmut said the work also had implications for research on stem cells .
many scientists believe that stem cells could one day provide replacement tissues for transplant , allowing patients to " grow their own " brain , heart or muscle cells .
the fact that stem cells were genetically unstable in mice suggests that the same might be true in human stem cells .
if this is the case , the use of such tissues for medical treatments could have unpredictable effects , or even cause cancer . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's sue nelson " cloning remains an imprecise science " the bbc 's pallab ghosh " today 's research suggests that the cloned material might be genetically unstable " david humphreys , report author " it is unwise to attempt -lsb- cloning -rsb- right now " professor ian wilmut , cloned dolly the sheep " this observation has provided us with why cloning is inefficient " american scientist professor panos zavos " there will be a cloned human being when the circumstances are correct " see also : 30 jan 01 -pipe- sci / tech cloned human planned ' by 2003 ' 19 jun 01 -pipe- sci / tech ban baby cloning , says royal society 29 mar 01 -pipe- sci / tech us politicians criticise human cloning efforts 09 mar 01 -pipe- sci / tech cloning humans : can it really be done ? 01 feb 00 -pipe- sci / tech a better class of clones internet links : science roslin institute , edinburgh clonaid the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top sci / tech stories now : astronomy 's next big thing ancient rock points to life 's origin mobile spam on the rise giant telescope project gets boost new hope for aids vaccine replace your mouse with your eye device could detect overdose drugs wireless internet arrives in china links to more sci / tech stories are at the foot of the page .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- boom time for geldof ?

by bbc news online 's orla ryan bob geldof first made his fame and fortune by not liking mondays .
now he is as well known for the businesses he runs as for being one of ireland 's first big musical exports .
this week , he struck a deal which will see his media and event company 10 alps broadcasting list on the london stock exchange on 30 july .
mr geldof is one of several celebrities who have channelled their creativity into business ventures - but not all of them have shared his success .
the deal will see 10 alps broadcasting - formed with alex connock with what was left from the sale of planet 24 in 1999 - take over the publicly quoted marketing and communications business osprey communications .
the new firm will be worth about £ 9m and mr geldof will own about 12 % of the shares .
according to the 10 alps website , his other business interests range from smart cards , online travel as well as a stake in the company which owns the survivor tv format . "
he has not just assumed that because he is bill wyman , he will do well " sticky fingers spokeswoman but how involved is he in the running of 10 alps broadcasting ?
" he is very involved at a practical level .
he will ring me between five and ten times a day , " alex connock , chief executive of the new company , said .
" you wo n't find bob at eight in the morning at a management or accounting meeting , but there is no reason for him to do that .
if you were to sit him down and ask him the strategy , he would absolutely be able to tell you . "
connock sees no downside to celebrity involvement in a business .
but he stresses that people should " form an opinion based on dealings with us not on their view of bob geldof " .
celebrity dot.gones but sometimes , all the celebrity help in the world can not help a company in a falling market .
many celebrities lent their name , money and expertise to internet ventures , which have failed to stay the pace .
joanna lumley was involved in clickmango.com , the health and beauty website , which failed to secure a second round of funding .
jonathan ross and matthew freud saw their investments disappear , when dot.com retailer toyzone closed its virtual doors .
some other celebrity entrepreneurs have yet to see how their net investments will pan out . "
you wo n't find bob at eight in the morning at a management or accounting meeting , but there is no reason for him to do that " alex connock david bowie lent his name to usabancshares.com , an internet bank where you could get bowie-branded cheque books and credit cards .
manchester united 's sir alex ferguson is a shareholder in toptable.co.uk , a restaurant information and booking service .
toptable 's managing director karen hanton stresses that he is not a token investor , on board only to garner publicity .
" he is kept fully informed of how his investment is doing , he obviously passes through to us any ideas he has about areas we should be looking at . "
planet hollywood a more traditional route for celebrity entrepreneurs is the restaurant business .
planet hollywood - backed by demi moore and bruce willis - spawned a host of imitators .
but the restaurant group ended up filing for bankruptcy protection in the us .
it was hit hard by its aggressive expansion but did eventually find new investors in prince alwaleed bin talal , of saudi arabia , and singaporean property magnate ong beng seng .
others , such as the fashion cafe , were n't as lucky .
" models and food do n't really go together , " a spokeswoman for sticky fingers pointed out .
sticky fingers - now a part of the maxwell restaurant group - was set up by rolling stone bill wyman in 1989 , taking his inspiration from the album of 1971 .
" he has not assumed that because he is bill wyman , he will do well , " the sticky fingers spokeswoman said .
" you have to have marketing , operations and service working right .
you could be tom cruise and nobody will come to your place . "

celebrity backing did n't help planet hollywood by bbc news online 's orla ryan bob geldof first made his fame and fortune by not liking mondays .
now he is as well known for the businesses he runs as for being one of ireland 's first big musical exports .
this week , he struck a deal which will see his media and event company 10 alps broadcasting list on the london stock exchange on 30 july .
geldof is now almost as famous for the businesses he runs as the songs he wrote mr geldof is one of several celebrities who have channelled their creativity into business ventures - but not all of them have shared his success .
the deal will see 10 alps broadcasting - formed with alex connock with what was left from the sale of planet 24 in 1999 - take over the publicly quoted marketing and communications business osprey communications .
the new firm will be worth about £ 9m and mr geldof will own about 12 % of the shares .
according to the 10 alps website , his other business interests range from smart cards , online travel as well as a stake in the company which owns the survivor tv format .
he has not just assumed that because he is bill wyman , he will do well sticky fingers spokeswoman but how involved is he in the running of 10 alps broadcasting ?
" he is very involved at a practical level .
he will ring me between five and ten times a day , " alex connock , chief executive of the new company , said .
" you wo n't find bob at eight in the morning at a management or accounting meeting , but there is no reason for him to do that .
if you were to sit him down and ask him the strategy , he would absolutely be able to tell you . "
connock sees no downside to celebrity involvement in a business .
but he stresses that people should " form an opinion based on dealings with us not on their view of bob geldof " .
celebrity dot.gones but sometimes , all the celebrity help in the world can not help a company in a falling market .
many celebrities lent their name , money and expertise to internet ventures , which have failed to stay the pace .
joanna lumley may now turn her back on internet investments joanna lumley was involved in clickmango.com , the health and beauty website , which failed to secure a second round of funding .
jonathan ross and matthew freud saw their investments disappear , when dot.com retailer toyzone closed its virtual doors .
some other celebrity entrepreneurs have yet to see how their net investments will pan out .
you wo n't find bob at eight in the morning at a management or accounting meeting , but there is no reason for him to do that alex connock david bowie lent his name to usabancshares.com , an internet bank where you could get bowie-branded cheque books and credit cards .
manchester united 's sir alex ferguson is a shareholder in toptable.co.uk , a restaurant information and booking service .
toptable 's managing director karen hanton stresses that he is not a token investor , on board only to garner publicity .
" he is kept fully informed of how his investment is doing , he obviously passes through to us any ideas he has about areas we should be looking at . "
planet hollywood a more traditional route for celebrity entrepreneurs is the restaurant business .
planet hollywood - backed by demi moore and bruce willis - spawned a host of imitators .
but the restaurant group ended up filing for bankruptcy protection in the us .
it was hit hard by its aggressive expansion but did eventually find new investors in prince alwaleed bin talal , of saudi arabia , and singaporean property magnate ong beng seng .
others , such as the fashion cafe , were n't as lucky .
" models and food do n't really go together , " a spokeswoman for sticky fingers pointed out .
sticky fingers - now a part of the maxwell restaurant group - was set up by rolling stone bill wyman in 1989 , taking his inspiration from the album of 1971 .
" he has not assumed that because he is bill wyman , he will do well , " the sticky fingers spokeswoman said .
" you have to have marketing , operations and service working right .
you could be tom cruise and nobody will come to your place . "
when the celebrity has the right attitude , there is room for cross-over promotions .
she added that if wyman was working on music or other creative projects , the restaurant was in regular touch to see what tie-ins could be done .

homeowners are urged to take immediate action to sort out their endowment mortgages or risk losing their homes .
a survey by the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- , the city watchdog , reveals a high degree of inaction among endowment holders - even though many face shortfalls worth thousands of pounds .
endowment-linked mortgages were the most popular type of home loan during the 1980s and early 1990s , but growth projections were based on healthy market conditions at the time .
since then , poor stock market returns combined with low inflation have left millions struggling to cover their loan .
what are your experiences of endowment mortgages ?
have you managed to cover your shortfall ?
did your bank or financial adviser help you to cope with the situation ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the rule in our free market economy is " caveat emptor " charles moore , scotland the rule in our free market economy is " caveat emptor " .
it literally means " buyer beware " but its real meaning is " if you can find a way of ripping people off without breaking the law -lrb- eg selling them dodgy endowment policies with false promises -rrb- then you are virtuous and deserving of prosperity and good fortune " .
your victims are just fools who deserved to be taken for a ride .
whatever happened to morality ?
charles moore , scotland losing your home by this method pales with the approaching risk of a global property crash .
a gold bullion crisis of epidemic proportions is currently being played out .
the problem stems from the thousands of tons of gold that has been borrowed and sold to produce cheap capital to fuel all these markets .
problem is that the gold is borrowed and must be paid back .
this is not possible since there is nothing like the amount of gold available , thus the bank of england 's vain attempts to suppress the gold price and manipulate the gold market .
better to remain liquid than face the approaching global financial crash .
peter iveson , canada some of your contributors have the great benefit of hindsight - some of us were sold this product as the norm 15-20 years ago .
it was not sold as a package that would involve risk and i for one as a first time buyer would never have gone down that route had it not been put forward as the only logical and trouble free way to go !
walter , uk in my opinion , endowments are still ok rodger edwards , uk in my opinion , endowments are still ok , providing that purchasers are insistent upon a -rrb- being sold a proper with profits policy and b -rrb- being sold a policy that meets the value of the loan at a very modest projected annual rate of growth .
-lrb- 5 % or less -rrb- both of these limitations will raise the actual cost of the endowment .
but then again , you pay your money and you take your choice .
rodger edwards , uk the fsa 's reluctance to begin a mortgage review seems inconsistent .
endowments are n't going to cover the cost of pensions because of falling investment returns .
this is the same reason a lot of people have lost out by transferring deferred pension benefits from occupational schemes .
yet pension transfers are included in the pension review .
tony beer , uk i have an endowment mortgage .
i took it out with my eyes open and understood that there was a degree of risk associated with it .
on balance i was prepared to take that risk .
we have received letters from the endowment providers stating that they would now provide forecasts based on different rates of growth , but that does n't tell me that what my actual growth rate has been to date .
most of these letters have been nothing other than a standard format containing no information specific to my policy .
yet their advice is to put more money into a fund which is already possibly under performing .
the endowments are long term investments and should be treated as such .
as ever there is no end of misinformation being spread about on this issue .
one figure that i would like to see is the actual number of endowments that have matured and not covered the mortgage .
i suspect very few .
paul styles , uk the only reason for taking out an endowment is the prospect of making money out of nothing .
the sellers use people 's greed to sell the things and then when it looks like it might not work out , the buyers look not only greedy but stupid .
and it is only at this point that they complain .
why should there be any compensation ?
all that happens is that the rest of us will have to pay one way or another and if the stock market boomed and there were no prospects of a shortfall would we be hearing any complaints ?
iain macintosh , uk brokers can exploit the british consumer 's belief that you can get something for nothing jon livesey , usa brokers would not be able to sell complicated instruments such as endowment policies were it not for the fact that they can exploit the british consumer 's belief that you can get something for nothing .
in most other countries , people understand that a loan is a loan and that in the end you have to pay it back , so clever- dick schemes that appear to pay part of the loan for you , simply do n't sell .
jon livesey , usa it seems to be that those people who opted for endowment mortgages did so on the understanding of a -rrb- getting an investment on their completed mortgage return and b -rrb- lower monthly repayments compared to boring old repayment mortgages .
so clearly they were taking a chance , or a risk , that if the economy did n't suit the best needs for their em then they would suffer the consequences .
it 's no good moaning about what advisors told you to do ; buying a house is the biggest investment you 'll ever make so you do your homework from as many different sources before you commit , especially with something as risky as ems .
russell o , england two years ago we were looking for a mortgage , and even though we told advisers we were n't interested in an endowment , that is all they tried to sell us .
luckily we did the sums , got a flexible mortgage , and have paid more than a third of it off already !
alison , uk it 's rather unfair to blame individuals for signing up to bad deals .
the financial services industry have a talent for thinking up " products " that defy comprehension by the layman , combined with a marketing army trained to put a good spin on anything .
it is now known that endowments were a risky move -lrb- though , had the last ten years produced high inflation no one would be complaining now -rrb- , but it was " common knowledge " that they were good value twenty years ago .
how long before we discover equally nasty stings in their replacements ?
julian hayward , uk complacency and ill-placed loyalty will cost you thousands of pounds joe , uk the likelihood that endowment mortgages would fail to fulfil their forecasts was made public by the sunday press way back in 1995 .
i took note of their gloomy prognosis and re-mortgaged soon thereafter .
i 've subsequently re-mortgaged again -lrb- last year -rrb- to take advantage of a discounted rate .
on a loan of £ 100k over 20 years , i estimate that i 've saved myself at least £ 34k in interest and charges by re-mortgaging twice .
when it comes to mortgages , complacency and ill-placed loyalty will cost you thousands of pounds .
joe , uk i started with a repayment policy , which after a few years i converted to an endowment mortgage .
early this year my endowment came up and i received 80 % more than required to pay off my mortgage .
the best investment i have ever had .
you do have to view these things over the full lifetime of the investment .
steve thursby , leeds my brother and i asked our estate agent / mortgage broker to prepare a repayment mortgage for us .
he left it a long time , then to our horror gave us the forms for an endowment mortgage .
in the end we went to the building society for a repayment mortgage .
at the time we strongly felt the mortgage broker wanted us to start an endowment mortgage so his commission would be higher .
his delay cost us thousands of pounds , as we missed the 1989 deadline for dual income mortgage relief by a couple of weeks .
brian milner , uk i took out two policies with the same insurer , one in 1986 and a second in 1989 , for a lesser amount .
at the time i opted for the slow start endowment simply because i could n't afford the monthly outgoings any other way .
i do n't think i was duped , although the projections of future value were very optimistic .
subsequently my insurer has written to inform me that the larger policy is likely -lrb- under the new assumptions -rrb- to exceed the amount necessary to pay off the loan , but the smaller policy , which is to mature at the same time is likely to fall short of the required amount .
they magnanimously offered to sell me a new policy to make up the shortfall , despite the fact that the sum of the two projected maturity values would cover the total loan .
derek long , uk when i signed up for my endowment i went for a projected value some 20 % over the value of my mortgage .
this gives me a double protection - firstly if it meets projections i get a nice lump sum at the end of it , but barring a 25-year stock market disaster it will still pay off my mortgage , even if it does under-perform a bit .
seems like a simple solution to me .
dave tankard , uk thanks for your concerns graham .
i did pretty much as you suggested and decided that for my purposes an endowment was the most appropriate vehicle for my investment .
as always , do your own research and remember , the value of your investments can go down as well as up .
you may not get back the full amount invested .
john b , uk endowment policies , as they are presently constructed , are weighted far too much in the interest of the company , with whom the policy holder has taken them out .
if through market trends or mis-investment , the policy does not yield a sufficient return , the policy holder carries the entire burden .
a much fairer solution , would be , if the company were required by law , to guarantee the minimum return needed to cover the capital .
there would be a much more equal share of the risk .
competition based on a company 's investment performance , would mean more protection for the consumer .
matt , uk i am paying into an small endowment at the moment but i do not even have a mortgage .
i am using it as a way to start paying for a house before i own one .
i have now decided that i will continue paying into the endowment but get a standard repayment mortgage as well so that in 22 years time when my endowment pays out it is an unexpected lump sum .
dominic , uk i took out an endowment mortgage three years ago and although i 've also since had to adjust my contributions , it still costs less -lrb- albeit not much -rrb- , than a repayment mortgage would .
and , i have accrued potential capital which i can take with me .
everyone seems to conveniently overlook the weakness of repayment mortgages being front-loaded with interest for the first 5 years .
greg turner , uk it pays to do a bit of research yourself graham , scotland well john b , one of the points that make endowments such terrible investments is the preposterous charges associated with them .
large lumps of the first few years and portions of subsequent years , the payments you make are just paid to the advisor who sold the endowment and other charges associated with the managed nature of the funds .
according to a number of financial web sites -lrb- motley fool , etc -rrb- you 'd be better putting money regularly into a tracker fund .
not only are the charges much smaller than managed funds , but the trackers typically do better than the managed funds over the medium / long term .
a fund manager may get it right a few years on the trot , but almost never gets it spot on over the number of years a mortgage is alive .
it pays to do a bit of research yourself and not just believe the guy who gets commission from what he sells you .
graham , scotland i have nearly 17 years left on my mortgage which is n't too big considering it 's in the south east of england .
my endowment payments are almost 30 % of the loan each month , so imagine my surprise when one of the largest endowment companies -lrb- brokered via the nationwide -rrb- are predicting i could be almost 30 % short of my final payment ! ! !
darren , uk i had a repayment mortgage and all sorts of insurance salesmen knocked on my door in the early 80 's trying to persuade me to change to an endowment one but for some reason which i still do n't understand , i refused .
then i applied for extra money to pay for double glazing and a new kitchen and decided to get an endowment mortgage just for that part of the loan .
i probably made a mistake but as it is such a small amount now , i can live with the consequences .
gill , uk it is astounding how we all blame the advisors , yet can not accept our own stupidity i , n ireland so , why did everybody take low cost endowments ?
because they thought they would get a large tax-free lump sum at the end as well as paying for their house !
any illustration after 6/4 / 88 would have confirmed not guaranteed and a possible shortfall on maturity at the lower rate of growth .
people as ever did not read anything and just signed details without checking or taking time to think .
how can you guarantee future investment returns ?
it is astounding how we all blame the advisors , yet can not accept our own stupidity .
i , n ireland what was that motto again - ' look before you leap ' perhaps ?
if you took the time to think about what you were doing , then you ca n't complain that the risk you took might not work out .
if you committed to many thousands of pounds of expenditure purely on the basis of a salesman 's set of figures then you were acting irresponsibly .
mark , uk i follow a simple rule : when something sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
ben , netherlands i received a letter from scottish amicable stating that my endowment policy -lrb- taken out 1988 -rrb- would need to make at least 7 % - 8 % to break even in 2013 .
at last years bonus rate my endowment would have a shortfall of about £ 7k .
i went to see my mortgage provider -lrb- woolwich -rrb- and swapped to their open plan base rate tracker repayment mortgage , cashed in my endowment and have spent that money on upgrading my house -lrb- bathroom and kitchen -rrb- .
the best thing i could do and i have not bothered about compensation .
mary leeson , uk allied dunbar have warned us of a potential shortfall - far from the extra lump sum they promised - the ombudsman is now investigating that .
otherwise we 've done nothing - the cost of changing to a repayment mortgage at this stage is too high : we just hope to make enough profit when we sell on retirement to pay the loan and buy something much smaller .
what do the insurance companies expect - that we would rush to pay them even more money once they had admitted letting us down so badly ?
it makes more sense to pay any extra direct to the lender and so reduce the debt and the interest payable on it .
diana pinnell , uk we 've had a rocky year on the stock market so people are getting paranoid about it all john b , uk i took out an endowment-backed mortgage 18 months ago , well aware of the chances of either a surplus or shortfall at final maturity .
to say it may or may not make it at this stage is rather pointless really .
if you calculate contributions based on a 6 % growth and then revise the growth to 4 % then it 's pretty obvious there will be an apparent shortfall .
if the market grows 8 % there will be a nice surplus .
we 've had a rocky year on the stock market so people are getting paranoid about it all .
that said , people who were told their final payment was guaranteed clearly deserve recompense for what is an outright lie .
one consideration the advisor who sold me my endowment suggested was that if the value is within about £ 10,000 either way of the required final value , that figure will be worth less in today 's terms due to 25 years ' worth of inflation .
john b , uk people are fools if they do n't read into things themselves .
d. cooper , uk endowments were mis-sold as badly as pensions in the 80 's .
i bought a house and was given the impression that i would be mad to opt for a repayment mortgage .
what i did n't know was that my entire first year 's payment went out as commission .
the insurance companies have been allowed to dodge the issue here and they should be forced to guarantee that their policies cover the amounts they stated they would when they were sold .
phil , uk everyone who bought one of these should have been made aware that they were taking a risk that the policy might not grow large enough to pay off the loan .
this could be another scandal on par with the private pensions mis-selling scandal , although it will be much more difficult to prove negligence .
tom , uk was the forecast done honestly ?
ian , england my projection from the firm that took over london and manchester was that the policy was on target but the current value of the policy has dropped almost £ 1000 since then -lrb- despite an extra year 's payments -rrb- .
was the forecast done honestly ?
ian , england i guess we were lucky .
when we tried to get our first mortgage our " advisor " tried to sell us an endowment .
fortunately he was so patronising -lrb- " of course you 'll end up making money on it , i do n't see how you can fail to " -rrb- that we went for a repayment just to spite him .
al , uk i was suspicious of endowment at the time so did n't go for it .
the reason is now obvious .
p , uk as someone who took out an endowment mortgage only two years ago i thought i would have had some comfort from the fact that my mortgage lender -lrb- abbey national -rrb- would be aware of overselling and have curbed its projections .
imagine my astonishment after only one-year of the mortgage to be told that it may not cover my loan .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- have you been caught in the endowment mortgage trap ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo friday , 6 july , 2001 , 07:46 gmt 08:46 uk have you been caught in the endowment mortgage trap ?
homeowners are urged to take immediate action to sort out their endowment mortgages or risk losing their homes .
a survey by the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- , the city watchdog , reveals a high degree of inaction among endowment holders - even though many face shortfalls worth thousands of pounds .
endowment-linked mortgages were the most popular type of home loan during the 1980s and early 1990s , but growth projections were based on healthy market conditions at the time .
since then , poor stock market returns combined with low inflation have left millions struggling to cover their loan .
what are your experiences of endowment mortgages ?
have you managed to cover your shortfall ?
did your bank or financial adviser help you to cope with the situation ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the rule in our free market economy is " caveat emptor " charles moore , scotland the rule in our free market economy is " caveat emptor " .
it literally means " buyer beware " but its real meaning is " if you can find a way of ripping people off without breaking the law -lrb- eg selling them dodgy endowment policies with false promises -rrb- then you are virtuous and deserving of prosperity and good fortune " .
your victims are just fools who deserved to be taken for a ride .
whatever happened to morality ?
charles moore , scotland losing your home by this method pales with the approaching risk of a global property crash .
a gold bullion crisis of epidemic proportions is currently being played out .
the problem stems from the thousands of tons of gold that has been borrowed and sold to produce cheap capital to fuel all these markets .
problem is that the gold is borrowed and must be paid back .
this is not possible since there is nothing like the amount of gold available , thus the bank of england 's vain attempts to suppress the gold price and manipulate the gold market .
better to remain liquid than face the approaching global financial crash .
peter iveson , canada some of your contributors have the great benefit of hindsight - some of us were sold this product as the norm 15-20 years ago .
it was not sold as a package that would involve risk and i for one as a first time buyer would never have gone down that route had it not been put forward as the only logical and trouble free way to go !
walter , uk in my opinion , endowments are still ok rodger edwards , uk in my opinion , endowments are still ok , providing that purchasers are insistent upon a -rrb- being sold a proper with profits policy and b -rrb- being sold a policy that meets the value of the loan at a very modest projected annual rate of growth .
-lrb- 5 % or less -rrb- both of these limitations will raise the actual cost of the endowment .
but then again , you pay your money and you take your choice .
rodger edwards , uk the fsa 's reluctance to begin a mortgage review seems inconsistent .
endowments are n't going to cover the cost of pensions because of falling investment returns .
this is the same reason a lot of people have lost out by transferring deferred pension benefits from occupational schemes .
yet pension transfers are included in the pension review .
tony beer , uk i have an endowment mortgage .
i took it out with my eyes open and understood that there was a degree of risk associated with it .
on balance i was prepared to take that risk .
we have received letters from the endowment providers stating that they would now provide forecasts based on different rates of growth , but that does n't tell me that what my actual growth rate has been to date .
most of these letters have been nothing other than a standard format containing no information specific to my policy .
yet their advice is to put more money into a fund which is already possibly under performing .
the endowments are long term investments and should be treated as such .
as ever there is no end of misinformation being spread about on this issue .
one figure that i would like to see is the actual number of endowments that have matured and not covered the mortgage .
i suspect very few .
paul styles , uk the only reason for taking out an endowment is the prospect of making money out of nothing .
the sellers use people 's greed to sell the things and then when it looks like it might not work out , the buyers look not only greedy but stupid .
and it is only at this point that they complain .
why should there be any compensation ?
all that happens is that the rest of us will have to pay one way or another and if the stock market boomed and there were no prospects of a shortfall would we be hearing any complaints ?
iain macintosh , uk brokers can exploit the british consumer 's belief that you can get something for nothing jon livesey , usa brokers would not be able to sell complicated instruments such as endowment policies were it not for the fact that they can exploit the british consumer 's belief that you can get something for nothing .
in most other countries , people understand that a loan is a loan and that in the end you have to pay it back , so clever- dick schemes that appear to pay part of the loan for you , simply do n't sell .
jon livesey , usa it seems to be that those people who opted for endowment mortgages did so on the understanding of a -rrb- getting an investment on their completed mortgage return and b -rrb- lower monthly repayments compared to boring old repayment mortgages .
so clearly they were taking a chance , or a risk , that if the economy did n't suit the best needs for their em then they would suffer the consequences .
it 's no good moaning about what advisors told you to do ; buying a house is the biggest investment you 'll ever make so you do your homework from as many different sources before you commit , especially with something as risky as ems .
russell o , england two years ago we were looking for a mortgage , and even though we told advisers we were n't interested in an endowment , that is all they tried to sell us .
luckily we did the sums , got a flexible mortgage , and have paid more than a third of it off already !
alison , uk it 's rather unfair to blame individuals for signing up to bad deals .
the financial services industry have a talent for thinking up " products " that defy comprehension by the layman , combined with a marketing army trained to put a good spin on anything .
it is now known that endowments were a risky move -lrb- though , had the last ten years produced high inflation no one would be complaining now -rrb- , but it was " common knowledge " that they were good value twenty years ago .
how long before we discover equally nasty stings in their replacements ?
julian hayward , uk complacency and ill-placed loyalty will cost you thousands of pounds joe , uk the likelihood that endowment mortgages would fail to fulfil their forecasts was made public by the sunday press way back in 1995 .
i took note of their gloomy prognosis and re-mortgaged soon thereafter .
i 've subsequently re-mortgaged again -lrb- last year -rrb- to take advantage of a discounted rate .
on a loan of £ 100k over 20 years , i estimate that i 've saved myself at least £ 34k in interest and charges by re-mortgaging twice .
when it comes to mortgages , complacency and ill-placed loyalty will cost you thousands of pounds .
joe , uk i started with a repayment policy , which after a few years i converted to an endowment mortgage .
early this year my endowment came up and i received 80 % more than required to pay off my mortgage .
the best investment i have ever had .
you do have to view these things over the full lifetime of the investment .
steve thursby , leeds my brother and i asked our estate agent / mortgage broker to prepare a repayment mortgage for us .
he left it a long time , then to our horror gave us the forms for an endowment mortgage .
in the end we went to the building society for a repayment mortgage .
at the time we strongly felt the mortgage broker wanted us to start an endowment mortgage so his commission would be higher .
his delay cost us thousands of pounds , as we missed the 1989 deadline for dual income mortgage relief by a couple of weeks .
brian milner , uk i took out two policies with the same insurer , one in 1986 and a second in 1989 , for a lesser amount .
at the time i opted for the slow start endowment simply because i could n't afford the monthly outgoings any other way .
i do n't think i was duped , although the projections of future value were very optimistic .
subsequently my insurer has written to inform me that the larger policy is likely -lrb- under the new assumptions -rrb- to exceed the amount necessary to pay off the loan , but the smaller policy , which is to mature at the same time is likely to fall short of the required amount .
they magnanimously offered to sell me a new policy to make up the shortfall , despite the fact that the sum of the two projected maturity values would cover the total loan .
derek long , uk when i signed up for my endowment i went for a projected value some 20 % over the value of my mortgage .
this gives me a double protection - firstly if it meets projections i get a nice lump sum at the end of it , but barring a 25-year stock market disaster it will still pay off my mortgage , even if it does under-perform a bit .
seems like a simple solution to me .
dave tankard , uk thanks for your concerns graham .
i did pretty much as you suggested and decided that for my purposes an endowment was the most appropriate vehicle for my investment .
as always , do your own research and remember , the value of your investments can go down as well as up .
you may not get back the full amount invested .
john b , uk endowment policies , as they are presently constructed , are weighted far too much in the interest of the company , with whom the policy holder has taken them out .
if through market trends or mis-investment , the policy does not yield a sufficient return , the policy holder carries the entire burden .
a much fairer solution , would be , if the company were required by law , to guarantee the minimum return needed to cover the capital .
there would be a much more equal share of the risk .
competition based on a company 's investment performance , would mean more protection for the consumer .
matt , uk i am paying into an small endowment at the moment but i do not even have a mortgage .
i am using it as a way to start paying for a house before i own one .
i have now decided that i will continue paying into the endowment but get a standard repayment mortgage as well so that in 22 years time when my endowment pays out it is an unexpected lump sum .
dominic , uk i took out an endowment mortgage three years ago and although i 've also since had to adjust my contributions , it still costs less -lrb- albeit not much -rrb- , than a repayment mortgage would .
and , i have accrued potential capital which i can take with me .
everyone seems to conveniently overlook the weakness of repayment mortgages being front-loaded with interest for the first 5 years .
greg turner , uk it pays to do a bit of research yourself graham , scotland well john b , one of the points that make endowments such terrible investments is the preposterous charges associated with them .
large lumps of the first few years and portions of subsequent years , the payments you make are just paid to the advisor who sold the endowment and other charges associated with the managed nature of the funds .
according to a number of financial web sites -lrb- motley fool , etc -rrb- you 'd be better putting money regularly into a tracker fund .
not only are the charges much smaller than managed funds , but the trackers typically do better than the managed funds over the medium / long term .
a fund manager may get it right a few years on the trot , but almost never gets it spot on over the number of years a mortgage is alive .
it pays to do a bit of research yourself and not just believe the guy who gets commission from what he sells you .
graham , scotland i have nearly 17 years left on my mortgage which is n't too big considering it 's in the south east of england .
my endowment payments are almost 30 % of the loan each month , so imagine my surprise when one of the largest endowment companies -lrb- brokered via the nationwide -rrb- are predicting i could be almost 30 % short of my final payment ! ! !
darren , uk i had a repayment mortgage and all sorts of insurance salesmen knocked on my door in the early 80 's trying to persuade me to change to an endowment one but for some reason which i still do n't understand , i refused .
then i applied for extra money to pay for double glazing and a new kitchen and decided to get an endowment mortgage just for that part of the loan .
i probably made a mistake but as it is such a small amount now , i can live with the consequences .
gill , uk it is astounding how we all blame the advisors , yet can not accept our own stupidity i , n ireland so , why did everybody take low cost endowments ?
because they thought they would get a large tax-free lump sum at the end as well as paying for their house !
any illustration after 6/4 / 88 would have confirmed not guaranteed and a possible shortfall on maturity at the lower rate of growth .
people as ever did not read anything and just signed details without checking or taking time to think .
how can you guarantee future investment returns ?
it is astounding how we all blame the advisors , yet can not accept our own stupidity .
i , n ireland what was that motto again - ' look before you leap ' perhaps ?
if you took the time to think about what you were doing , then you ca n't complain that the risk you took might not work out .
if you committed to many thousands of pounds of expenditure purely on the basis of a salesman 's set of figures then you were acting irresponsibly .
mark , uk i follow a simple rule : when something sounds too good to be true , it probably is .
ben , netherlands i received a letter from scottish amicable stating that my endowment policy -lrb- taken out 1988 -rrb- would need to make at least 7 % - 8 % to break even in 2013 .
at last years bonus rate my endowment would have a shortfall of about £ 7k .
i went to see my mortgage provider -lrb- woolwich -rrb- and swapped to their open plan base rate tracker repayment mortgage , cashed in my endowment and have spent that money on upgrading my house -lrb- bathroom and kitchen -rrb- .
the best thing i could do and i have not bothered about compensation .
mary leeson , uk allied dunbar have warned us of a potential shortfall - far from the extra lump sum they promised - the ombudsman is now investigating that .
otherwise we 've done nothing - the cost of changing to a repayment mortgage at this stage is too high : we just hope to make enough profit when we sell on retirement to pay the loan and buy something much smaller .
what do the insurance companies expect - that we would rush to pay them even more money once they had admitted letting us down so badly ?
it makes more sense to pay any extra direct to the lender and so reduce the debt and the interest payable on it .
diana pinnell , uk we 've had a rocky year on the stock market so people are getting paranoid about it all john b , uk i took out an endowment-backed mortgage 18 months ago , well aware of the chances of either a surplus or shortfall at final maturity .
to say it may or may not make it at this stage is rather pointless really .
if you calculate contributions based on a 6 % growth and then revise the growth to 4 % then it 's pretty obvious there will be an apparent shortfall .
if the market grows 8 % there will be a nice surplus .
we 've had a rocky year on the stock market so people are getting paranoid about it all .
that said , people who were told their final payment was guaranteed clearly deserve recompense for what is an outright lie .
one consideration the advisor who sold me my endowment suggested was that if the value is within about £ 10,000 either way of the required final value , that figure will be worth less in today 's terms due to 25 years ' worth of inflation .
john b , uk people are fools if they do n't read into things themselves .
d. cooper , uk endowments were mis-sold as badly as pensions in the 80 's .
i bought a house and was given the impression that i would be mad to opt for a repayment mortgage .
what i did n't know was that my entire first year 's payment went out as commission .
the insurance companies have been allowed to dodge the issue here and they should be forced to guarantee that their policies cover the amounts they stated they would when they were sold .
phil , uk everyone who bought one of these should have been made aware that they were taking a risk that the policy might not grow large enough to pay off the loan .
this could be another scandal on par with the private pensions mis-selling scandal , although it will be much more difficult to prove negligence .
tom , uk was the forecast done honestly ?
ian , england my projection from the firm that took over london and manchester was that the policy was on target but the current value of the policy has dropped almost £ 1000 since then -lrb- despite an extra year 's payments -rrb- .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- pesticides : do you know what is in your food ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo friday , 6 july , 2001 , 07:47 gmt 08:47 uk pesticides : do you know what is in your food ?
the co-op , one of the uk 's biggest retailers , is to ban more than 20 common pesticides used in food production and restricting the use of more than 30 others .
the company said it had bowed to consumer pressure after a survey it commissioned found that more than 70 % of 1,000 people interviewed were worried about the use of pesticides .
the chemicals include " hormone disrupters " and organophosphates from the nerve gas family .
how safe is the food you eat ?
has the co-op done the right thing ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction i hope the other supermarkets quickly follow its lead michael entill , uk good for the co-op !
i hope the other supermarkets quickly follow its lead .
the co-op will have my custom until they do .
michael entill , uk i have talked to quite a few farmers on this subject and they say in the majority that pesticides are needed otherwise we would not have enough crops to feed the world population .
there should be a law passed that makes it the responsibility of the supplier to make sure the produce is cleaned to an acceptable level before it hits the shelves .
emma , usa millions of people die of liver cancer resulting from a naturally occurring fungus which grows on fruit and veg .
by contrast , all the evidence in the uk is that eating lots of fruit and veg -lrb- that 's the stuff with pesticides and fungicides in -rrb- is good for you .
this is a measure which will increase the cost of fruit and veg , and decrease public health .
ralph ryder , uk disfigured , partly damaged produce is equally nutritious paul , uk paul the agronomist outlined the key issue : there is a misconception amongst the public , partly instilled by mass-marketing campaigns displaying the perfectly symmetrical , shiny and happy fruit / vegetable .
disfigured , partly damaged produce , the reason for which pesticides are commonly used , is equally nutritious and without a regular chemical soaking , is cheaper and healthier -lrb- unless clinical trials have shown pesticides to be beneficial in some way -rrb- .
paul , uk with the increased number of people suffering from allergy related illnesses , it is surprising that governments have not been more meticulous / careful / mindful with / to the demands of the agro-petro / chemical businesses .
these concerns are there to make profits which come before the well-being of the people of this planet .
i believe that the gm controversy will have in a few years time , the same repercussions .
already we see one butterfly population is being affected in the states with the development of the gm crops .
what next ?
are we killing all living beings on this planet for our own greedy consumption ?
we live sedentary lives and we do not need to ingest the amount of calories we do daily .
the hormone disrupters , organophosphates and other chemicals used in our food chain are not necessary if only we , consumers stop to think the damage we are doing to this small planet .
danielle domingue banyai , uk pesticides are used to help farmers produce sufficient food to feed the country .
without their use where would we be ?
still having to grow our own food in gardens and having to shop every day ?
finding it difficult to combat diseases in crops , animals and even mankind ?
pesticides have made our lives what they are today .
ok pesticides may not be all good , and their bad points not totally clear , but the restraints that are already placed on farmers are vast , and why would farmers spend money to buy chemicals and then spend the time and the money to spray their crops if they did not feel it was needed .
how many other people would work from early morning to late at night for such a little return ?
many people may feel that the co-op have made the right move but what about all the other chemicals that are used in the production of other products , are they going to ban or restrict them to ?
abi , scotland a blanket ban on pesticides will only hurt those least able to secure alternative foods euan gray , uk i inherited two apple trees last time i moved .
i did n't spray them , and got a disappointing yield and plenty of insect damage .
this year , i sprayed with pyrethrum , and there are no insects on the apples and it looks like a much greater harvest .
they will still be a lot healthier -lrb- as well as tasting better -rrb- than the stuff in the local supermarket .
used responsibly , pesticides are pretty much essential to modern agriculture , but striking a balance between moderate chemical use and the encouragement of natural predators is required .
remember , though , that not everyone can afford to pay the higher prices for so-called organic foods - a blanket ban on pesticides will only hurt those least able to secure alternative foods - i.e. the poor .
euan gray , uk this is a purely marketing ploy .
chemicals that are approved in this country have been through stringent testing and are safe to use .
what expertise does the co-op have to do this type of testing ?
all they want to do to scare people when there is no reason .
they were a founder member of the approved produce scheme which was set up to ensure all fresh produce supplied to supermarkets was grown according to the best integrated crop management systems available .
already the government tests foods for chemical residues and publishes the results so why do the co-op want to repeat this ?
denis walsh , england i am saddened by some of the naive comments about " long term effects " of pesticides , and supposed " increased susceptibility " to various minor ailments .
presumably they prefer the alternatives of infant mortality , or becoming ill after some dodgy organism has had a go at their food ?
perhaps they would prefer to have the threat of famine hanging over them ?
the sanitised view of the past that some of these people hold is ridiculous - 100 years ago they would have been lucky to make it to 18 .
if they did , they would have probably lost most of their teeth by then , and their general state of health would be poor , due to their body being full of various parasites .
get a grip , people !
chris brown , uk only 100 % " safe " products from co-op , then ?
sounds like they wo n't have much on their shelves to sell soon .
bill , uk when i was in the usa , they washed the fruit to ensure no residue was left on the outside , they then waxed it to protect the outer skin .
labelling this so you just rubbed it off .
also they listed herbicides and pesticides used and labelled the box the fruit came in clearly , showing tested clear for residue and content of harmful toxins .
if this procedure is followed by all countries - ours does not by the way - regular testing by environment agencies would cancel the need for what the co-op has had to do .
without herbicides and pesticides , famine would be rife , so as long as the above is carried out there should be no problems .
graham , england this is more populist nonsense , i 'm afraid .
there 's so much needless concern about what are very small quantities of chemicals which are known to be safe -lrb- because they 've been tested and approved by the regulatory authorities -rrb- .
it 's time that so-called environmentalists actually started considering scientific evidence when making their claims : there are far more pressing concerns , such as global warming , for which the evidence is much stronger .
jim , uk there are two issues the fruit and vegetable buyer should address before worrying about pesticides .
is a fair price being paid for imported food , and is the food being imported because it is out of season here .
exploitation of growers in developing countries is a form of slavery .
if you ca n't be sure a fair price is being charged , do n't buy .
it is obscene to fly carrots thousands of miles because they are out of season here .
learn to eat what is in season .
you will have a richer and more varied diet , support local producers , and reduce global pollution .
andrew , uk we should not forget that there are good reasons for chemical use in agriculture angela , new zealand most of the posts here seem to be naively supportive of the co-op ban .
but people forget that before the introduction of pesticides , herbicides and preservatives in the early 20th century agriculture was at the mercy of the environment .
blight , fungus and pests have been responsible for famine and economic destruction throughout history .
the use of chemicals led to stable food production and the development for the first time of an economy not based on agriculture in the western world .
if pesticides were to be banned overnight , yield would decrease , quality would decrease and you could forget about getting affordable fruit in winter .
while i agree that it is time for alternatives to be better investigated such as biological control for pests and gm food .
a ban on pesticides and other agri-chemicals at this time is a foolish publicity stunt .
also lets not forget that even " organic " growers routinely use up to 50 % of pesticides and herbicides used by conventional growers .
we need to look for environmentally solutions to food production but we should not forget that there are good reasons for chemical use in agriculture .
we have a huge and growing population .
there is no quick fix to food supply .
angela , new zealand this is a valuable , wise and scientifically sound move .
many functional health problems can be positively impacted by avoiding pesticide residues .
we live , as has been said , in a soup of chemicals , many carcinogenic , and whatever the current authorities say , there is an epidemic of certain cancers .
ignoring this obvious link is no longer defensible .
dr john stanley , ireland once again the paranoia merchants are at it .
careful washing and preparation of food gives everybody a balanced diet .
the nanny state will always find some damn thing that 's bad for us .
there are far too many dome headed , sandal-wearing dipsticks around these days who have little experience of the real world but think it is their god given right to tell us all what we should be eating .
if it 's all so bad for us , then why are people living longer ?
keith simpson , uk bowing to hysterical reactions of people who imagine that the risks of crop protection products are greater than they really are could reverse progress in agricultural methods .
do these people not recognise the benefit of using pesticides , namely that more food can be produced on less land ?
or realise that the world population is growing and that world food production needs to keep up with this ?
paranoia from affluent societies could jeopardise progress .
toby bruce , uk hey there co-op , i 'm coming your way .
well done .
i 've been spending quite a lot of precious time recently growing my own vegetables due to the extortionate price of " pure organic " food .
although there are some issues with yields , this price premium is due largely to there being much more demand in the uk than supply .
the problem for farmers is the cost of conversion , during which they get all the problems of abandoning these toxic chemicals , but none of the benefits .
so let 's see some real government funding alongside the supermarkets to help farmers give up the wonder drugs and look after both our health and the health of our countryside .
simon redding , uk i am amazed that a supermarket can now dictate how food can be produced without producing anything itself .
you should immediately remove all shampoo , makeup , from the stores as they are full of chemicals .
also no garden centre should sell any plant food as that has chemicals too .
do not even think about fly sprays they contain op 's from the nerve agents .
the point is you can go over the top , that is why there are governments that monitor and test .
leave this to the fsa , not a co-op that is trying a cheap publicity stunt .
andrew cooke , uk fair play to the co-op .
many people are uneasy about the levels of pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables -lrb- pesticides are , after all , specifically designed to be inimical to life -rrb- .
perhaps if someone was able to prove that these residues are safe , rather than relying on the fact that no solid proof exists yet that pesticide residues have caused excess cancers or other diseases , the co-op would not have had to stick their neck out like this .
guy chapman , uk there are two options : 1 -rrb- no pesticides and millions dying from diseases carried by insects or 2 -rrb- use of pesticides and maybe feel a little nauseous , but then again it could just be the food preparation and not the pesticides causing you to feel nauseous as for me , i 'll take the pesticides and genetically altered foods .
technology is how our species has survived for centuries .
do we want to become extinct because it would be good for the planet ?
not me .
jw garner , usa as a doctor who is also an apple grower , i hope my thoughts deserve to be heard .
i planted a small orchard in 1993 , full of " organic " idealism .
three years later , my partner and i had to face the fact that pests and diseases were not affecting our " profits " , they were destroying everything we 'd worked for .
the trees were dying from the combined attacks of fungi , bacteria and insects and we had to choose-spray a minimal amount of chemicals or walk away from our orchard .
of course sprays should be minimised , and people should be prepared to accept both blemished fruit and higher prices , but the idea that the present world population can be fed without some use of chemicals is as unfounded as the belief that pesticide residues have been shown to cause ill health .
stephen , england wonderful news co-op i hope more people follow your example .
like many other people i know i do not want to eat food smothered in pesticides , fungicides and waxes .
ideally too i would like it to be produced locally .
i have parkinson 's disease , now a pretty common disease in uk but when parkinson first described it and gave it his name it was a very , very , very rare disease .
now it is very common in rural , agricultural areas - what is commonly unavoidable by people like me who live in rural areas - exactly , pesticide !
not proven of course , after all which chemical company would fund that research - they are too busy funding research into gm crops !
in my state of health you become very cynical i 'm afraid .
merry , uk whilst i would not necessarily advocate that all food be organic , i do believe that the balance needs to be redressed towards good husbandry and more traditional good practice .
i believe that as with many things the power of the marketing people is becoming too great and we are falling for the myth that things have to be perfect .
give me a slightly blemished apple that has not been doused in chemicals , travelled half way round the world and been stored for months anytime !
jan , england it makes me wonder exactly what supposedly natural and healthy products contain these days richard , uk occasionally , i 've eaten a piece of fruit from a supermarket and felt a bit nauseous .
it makes me wonder exactly what supposedly natural and healthy products contain these days .
yuk !
i try not to even think about the potential long-term consequences !
richard , uk surely the government should be tackling this sort of thing , rather than letting it be dealt with by non-elected organisations such as co-op .
i think that it is a good thing , i just think it is a shame that the government is shirking its responsibilities .
duncan drury , london , uk hooray for the co-op kate smith , uk hooray for the co-op .
so what if it 's a marketing ploy - for once it 's a bit of marketing that 's not selling us a logo or a " look " but is instead doing us some practical good .
and if other supermarkets join in , that 'll be great .
message for the co-op : i 'm abandoning sainsbury 's and coming to shop with you .
kate smith , uk three questions : 1 / how will they know what pesticides have been used in the production of the chinese apples , or the kenyan beans , or the south african oranges that they sell ?
simply telling their suppliers not to use certain chemicals without any form of policing sounds a bit optimistic to me .
2 / will they pay their uk suppliers a healthy supplement , to make up for lower yields .
answers on a postcard .
3 / how will they persuade the public to buy food , especially fruit , that costs more , and bears the marks of being grown " naturally " - the average shopper wants to buy produce of uniform size , shape and colour .
you do n't get that level of conformity without the use of chemicals .
john , uk i 'm all for it , whether or not it 's a publicity stunt !
i do n't want my food contaminated with pesticides -lrb- or specific weedkillers , for that matter -rrb- and value the health of my children and future generations far above saving a few pence on the price of a kilo of spuds !
not to mention the long-term damage caused to the environment generally by a build-up of chemical residues .
ros , uk i personally welcome the co-op 's decision and i hope that more leading supermarkets will follow nicola , uk in the last 2 years i have developed irritable bowel syndrome - at least that 's what i 've been diagnosed with .
in the last year both of my brothers have developed exactly the same symptoms .
more recently my boyfriend has started to suffer the same symptoms .
i have no medical expertise and i do not have a great understanding of farming practises however i am becoming increasingly concerned about the chemicals that are being used and just what is going into our food .
i personally welcome the co-op 's decision and i hope that more leading supermarkets will follow .
nicola , uk when i buy an apple , i just want a fresh , simple apple .
the fact that the supermarkets might have stored it for 3 weeks before they put it on the shelve , and realising the amount of pesticides they smear on it , makes me think that i might be better off not to eat it all !
worst still , we have to pay a penalty fare to buy the real thing -lrb- organic -rrb- , what right do the consumers have ?
also , i really think 50 % of the profit of selling an apple should go back to the good old farmers instead of the supermarket 's boss pocket .
catherine , london u.k. good on the co-op .
its about time the big suppliers took a stance , and listened to the wishes of an informed customer base and demand more natural foods from the farmers .
you only have to look at the demand for organic produce -lrb- my local tesco sells out of fresh organic produce within a couple of hours of it going on display ! -rrb- and the public resistance to gm foods to see the direction that the food debate is going in .
lets hope more of the retailers follow the co-op and force the hand of the suppliers .
dave , wales yet more paranoia being spread by the " it 's man-made , it must be harmful " types .
quite a lot of foods -lrb- parsnips , for example , and rhubarb -rrb- " naturally " contain potentially-harmful-in-massive-doses substances and would be subject to major restrictions if they were a manufactured foodstuff !
personally , i do n't worry about pesticide residues in foods , the levels are so low that 20 years ago they could n't have been measured reliably anyway .
parsnips , anyone ?
pete morgan-lucas , wiltshire , uk why would anyone want to eat food unnecessarily sprayed with chemicals that have n't been fully tested ?
i do n't want to be a part of a mass clinical trial - this is consumerism gone mad !
tm , england i feel it is necessary for me to use pesticides and fungicides ralph , usa i raise pecans in the united states .
in order for me to produce a marketable crop i feel it is necessary for me to use pesticides and fungicides .
if i did n't , the quality would be poor and mostly damaged or lost by insect or disease .
i personally do n't want to consume food that has already been partially eaten by insects or contains their larvae .
i too am concerned with pesticide use .
i believe that if a little diligence and common sense are used in the application and consumers rinse their produce , our food supply is the safest in history .
ralph , usa individual chemicals may seem safe when they are tested one by one over a short time scale under laboratory conditions .
but no-one can say for sure what their long-term effect will be , especially when combined with the many other chemicals present in our food and environment .
i think the co-op is doing the right thing - but expect to pay more for it !
paul , london i think this is a fantastic step towards supplying the public with a healthier option without the price of organic foods .
let 's hope the other supermarket chains do n't take too long to follow suit !
ej green , uk i am convinced that all the messing around with our food supply has made many people in this country susceptible to many new ailments mandi , uk my partner suffers from hives .
this is due to a low tolerance to additives / colours / pesticides in food .
he has had several checks and nobody can identify what it is that makes his body react .
i am convinced that all the messing around with our food supply has made many people in this country susceptible to many new ailments and aggravated the illness people already suffer from .
mandi , uk i applaud co-op ; we have yet to master the bigger things around us namely insects and plants that can all benefit our methods of production .
why are others so ignorant that they assume that if we do n't understand it we should ' spray it away ' ?
not being uniform is a celebration in nature and humanity , why are we striving for identically produce ?
fergus ross , britain as an agronomist , controlling and monitoring what is applied to products grown in the uk , i have to wonder if the british public is actually aware of how tightly controlled pesticide and other applications are .
a farmer will not spend money on very expensive applications unless he has no option other than to loose his crop .
if the consumer wishes to see shelves stocked high in the local supermarket with stunted and pest damaged products , petition your supermarket managers as it is the multinational companies ' demands for 99 % perfect products at cheap prices which drive the whole issue .
paul , uk i 'm afraid this is just another attempt to increase market share keith moffitt , switzerland i 'm afraid this is just another attempt to increase market share in the increasingly competitive supermarket area .
what the supermarkets have realised is that joe public knows a little about the downsides but nothing about the upsides .
couple this with increasing food concern -lrb- bse , e-coli in meat , salmonella in eggs , gm crops etc -rrb- and what you have is a marketing opportunity based on fear .
i think the co-op should know better but in the end it wo n't win them any friends .
it will simply cause more supermarkets to jump on the bandwagon .
keith moffitt , switzerland i think they 're right in principle , but i also hope that they do n't forget the reason for using pesticides to start with - namely to stop pests eating the food before we do .
we need to find alternative means of keeping them out of our food - just banning the pesticides with no alternative strategy is going to give the pests a free lunch .
the ban is a step in the right direction but we need to go much further .
p , uk and not before time .
these chemicals build up in the environment with unknown effects on humans , wildlife and the food chain .
they 're safe say the producers , but how many times do we have to have one withdrawn after a few years due to " unforeseen problems " before we learn .
and these same companies want to sell us gm crops that are resistant to pesticides so that even more chemicals can be dumped on the land .
we 're supposed to be this planet 's most intelligent and developed life form and it would be a pleasant change if we acted like it for once .
stephen cooke , uk well done co-op , it 's about time somebody put people above profit .
i do n't want a " perfect " onion if it 's going to give me cancer in 30 years !
maybe the supermarkets ought to rethink their supply strategies and supply each store from local producers instead of central warehouses .
it might reduce the need for preservative chemicals and also take a few trucks off the road to boot .
so what if it 's a logistical headache , it 's got to be better than slowly killing your customers .
al , uk anything that slows the use of chemicals and gm techniques is welcome karina , france anything that slows the use of chemicals and gm techniques is welcome .
until we can firmly declare that these products are safe to humans and the environment , both in terms of food and of the ensuing chain -lrb- water cycle , etc -rrb- , these products should not be in common use .
it is about time we woke up and used proper contained trials of all pesticides , fertilisers and modern genetic techniques .
karina , france i back the co-op .
it 's not just what pesticides we eat do to our health , it 's the impact they have on our countryside .
the numbers of birds and animals seen in the countryside has dropped dramatically as farming has intensified .
i want to see more small farms producing high quality food without recourse to vast quantities of chemicals .
it will provide us with better food , help revive poor rural areas , and preserve a beautiful landscape .
martyn williams , uk presumably if the co-op is so worried about our health they will ban cigarettes and alcohol as well !
smells like a pr stunt to me !
bob , england at the same time , with no sense of irony , the biotech company aventis is saying it will use legal action against the government to prevent it revealing information about the pesticides it is using on its gm crop trials .
it seems obvious that the big lie about gm -lrb- that it needs less pesticide -rrb- is about to be burst and the companies who stand to get rich from gm will do anything to suppress the facts .
the co-op has made a brave move here and i hope the other stores will follow suit .

the co-op , one of the uk 's biggest retailers , is to ban more than 20 common pesticides used in food production and restricting the use of more than 30 others .
the company said it had bowed to consumer pressure after a survey it commissioned found that more than 70 % of 1,000 people interviewed were worried about the use of pesticides .
the chemicals include " hormone disrupters " and organophosphates from the nerve gas family .
how safe is the food you eat ?
has the co-op done the right thing ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction i hope the other supermarkets quickly follow its lead michael entill , uk good for the co-op !
i hope the other supermarkets quickly follow its lead .
the co-op will have my custom until they do .
michael entill , uk i have talked to quite a few farmers on this subject and they say in the majority that pesticides are needed otherwise we would not have enough crops to feed the world population .
there should be a law passed that makes it the responsibility of the supplier to make sure the produce is cleaned to an acceptable level before it hits the shelves .
emma , usa millions of people die of liver cancer resulting from a naturally occurring fungus which grows on fruit and veg .
by contrast , all the evidence in the uk is that eating lots of fruit and veg -lrb- that 's the stuff with pesticides and fungicides in -rrb- is good for you .
this is a measure which will increase the cost of fruit and veg , and decrease public health .
ralph ryder , uk disfigured , partly damaged produce is equally nutritious paul , uk paul the agronomist outlined the key issue : there is a misconception amongst the public , partly instilled by mass-marketing campaigns displaying the perfectly symmetrical , shiny and happy fruit / vegetable .
disfigured , partly damaged produce , the reason for which pesticides are commonly used , is equally nutritious and without a regular chemical soaking , is cheaper and healthier -lrb- unless clinical trials have shown pesticides to be beneficial in some way -rrb- .
paul , uk with the increased number of people suffering from allergy related illnesses , it is surprising that governments have not been more meticulous / careful / mindful with / to the demands of the agro-petro / chemical businesses .
these concerns are there to make profits which come before the well-being of the people of this planet .
i believe that the gm controversy will have in a few years time , the same repercussions .
already we see one butterfly population is being affected in the states with the development of the gm crops .
what next ?
are we killing all living beings on this planet for our own greedy consumption ?
we live sedentary lives and we do not need to ingest the amount of calories we do daily .
the hormone disrupters , organophosphates and other chemicals used in our food chain are not necessary if only we , consumers stop to think the damage we are doing to this small planet .
danielle domingue banyai , uk pesticides are used to help farmers produce sufficient food to feed the country .
without their use where would we be ?
still having to grow our own food in gardens and having to shop every day ?
finding it difficult to combat diseases in crops , animals and even mankind ?
pesticides have made our lives what they are today .
ok pesticides may not be all good , and their bad points not totally clear , but the restraints that are already placed on farmers are vast , and why would farmers spend money to buy chemicals and then spend the time and the money to spray their crops if they did not feel it was needed .
how many other people would work from early morning to late at night for such a little return ?
many people may feel that the co-op have made the right move but what about all the other chemicals that are used in the production of other products , are they going to ban or restrict them to ?
abi , scotland a blanket ban on pesticides will only hurt those least able to secure alternative foods euan gray , uk i inherited two apple trees last time i moved .
i did n't spray them , and got a disappointing yield and plenty of insect damage .
this year , i sprayed with pyrethrum , and there are no insects on the apples and it looks like a much greater harvest .
they will still be a lot healthier -lrb- as well as tasting better -rrb- than the stuff in the local supermarket .
used responsibly , pesticides are pretty much essential to modern agriculture , but striking a balance between moderate chemical use and the encouragement of natural predators is required .
remember , though , that not everyone can afford to pay the higher prices for so-called organic foods - a blanket ban on pesticides will only hurt those least able to secure alternative foods - i.e. the poor .
euan gray , uk this is a purely marketing ploy .
chemicals that are approved in this country have been through stringent testing and are safe to use .
what expertise does the co-op have to do this type of testing ?
all they want to do to scare people when there is no reason .
they were a founder member of the approved produce scheme which was set up to ensure all fresh produce supplied to supermarkets was grown according to the best integrated crop management systems available .
already the government tests foods for chemical residues and publishes the results so why do the co-op want to repeat this ?
denis walsh , england i am saddened by some of the naive comments about " long term effects " of pesticides , and supposed " increased susceptibility " to various minor ailments .
presumably they prefer the alternatives of infant mortality , or becoming ill after some dodgy organism has had a go at their food ?
perhaps they would prefer to have the threat of famine hanging over them ?
the sanitised view of the past that some of these people hold is ridiculous - 100 years ago they would have been lucky to make it to 18 .
if they did , they would have probably lost most of their teeth by then , and their general state of health would be poor , due to their body being full of various parasites .
get a grip , people !
chris brown , uk only 100 % " safe " products from co-op , then ?
sounds like they wo n't have much on their shelves to sell soon .
bill , uk when i was in the usa , they washed the fruit to ensure no residue was left on the outside , they then waxed it to protect the outer skin .
labelling this so you just rubbed it off .
also they listed herbicides and pesticides used and labelled the box the fruit came in clearly , showing tested clear for residue and content of harmful toxins .
if this procedure is followed by all countries - ours does not by the way - regular testing by environment agencies would cancel the need for what the co-op has had to do .
without herbicides and pesticides , famine would be rife , so as long as the above is carried out there should be no problems .
graham , england this is more populist nonsense , i 'm afraid .
there 's so much needless concern about what are very small quantities of chemicals which are known to be safe -lrb- because they 've been tested and approved by the regulatory authorities -rrb- .
it 's time that so-called environmentalists actually started considering scientific evidence when making their claims : there are far more pressing concerns , such as global warming , for which the evidence is much stronger .
jim , uk there are two issues the fruit and vegetable buyer should address before worrying about pesticides .
is a fair price being paid for imported food , and is the food being imported because it is out of season here .
exploitation of growers in developing countries is a form of slavery .
if you ca n't be sure a fair price is being charged , do n't buy .
it is obscene to fly carrots thousands of miles because they are out of season here .
learn to eat what is in season .
you will have a richer and more varied diet , support local producers , and reduce global pollution .
andrew , uk we should not forget that there are good reasons for chemical use in agriculture angela , new zealand most of the posts here seem to be naively supportive of the co-op ban .
but people forget that before the introduction of pesticides , herbicides and preservatives in the early 20th century agriculture was at the mercy of the environment .
blight , fungus and pests have been responsible for famine and economic destruction throughout history .
the use of chemicals led to stable food production and the development for the first time of an economy not based on agriculture in the western world .
if pesticides were to be banned overnight , yield would decrease , quality would decrease and you could forget about getting affordable fruit in winter .
while i agree that it is time for alternatives to be better investigated such as biological control for pests and gm food .
a ban on pesticides and other agri-chemicals at this time is a foolish publicity stunt .
also lets not forget that even " organic " growers routinely use up to 50 % of pesticides and herbicides used by conventional growers .
we need to look for environmentally solutions to food production but we should not forget that there are good reasons for chemical use in agriculture .
we have a huge and growing population .
there is no quick fix to food supply .
angela , new zealand this is a valuable , wise and scientifically sound move .
many functional health problems can be positively impacted by avoiding pesticide residues .
we live , as has been said , in a soup of chemicals , many carcinogenic , and whatever the current authorities say , there is an epidemic of certain cancers .
ignoring this obvious link is no longer defensible .
dr john stanley , ireland once again the paranoia merchants are at it .
careful washing and preparation of food gives everybody a balanced diet .
the nanny state will always find some damn thing that 's bad for us .
there are far too many dome headed , sandal-wearing dipsticks around these days who have little experience of the real world but think it is their god given right to tell us all what we should be eating .
if it 's all so bad for us , then why are people living longer ?
keith simpson , uk bowing to hysterical reactions of people who imagine that the risks of crop protection products are greater than they really are could reverse progress in agricultural methods .
do these people not recognise the benefit of using pesticides , namely that more food can be produced on less land ?
or realise that the world population is growing and that world food production needs to keep up with this ?
paranoia from affluent societies could jeopardise progress .
toby bruce , uk hey there co-op , i 'm coming your way .
well done .
i 've been spending quite a lot of precious time recently growing my own vegetables due to the extortionate price of " pure organic " food .
although there are some issues with yields , this price premium is due largely to there being much more demand in the uk than supply .
the problem for farmers is the cost of conversion , during which they get all the problems of abandoning these toxic chemicals , but none of the benefits .
so let 's see some real government funding alongside the supermarkets to help farmers give up the wonder drugs and look after both our health and the health of our countryside .
simon redding , uk i am amazed that a supermarket can now dictate how food can be produced without producing anything itself .
you should immediately remove all shampoo , makeup , from the stores as they are full of chemicals .
also no garden centre should sell any plant food as that has chemicals too .
do not even think about fly sprays they contain op 's from the nerve agents .
the point is you can go over the top , that is why there are governments that monitor and test .
leave this to the fsa , not a co-op that is trying a cheap publicity stunt .
andrew cooke , uk fair play to the co-op .

i do n't want to be a part of a mass clinical trial - this is consumerism gone mad !
tm , england i feel it is necessary for me to use pesticides and fungicides ralph , usa i raise pecans in the united states .
in order for me to produce a marketable crop i feel it is necessary for me to use pesticides and fungicides .
if i did n't , the quality would be poor and mostly damaged or lost by insect or disease .
i personally do n't want to consume food that has already been partially eaten by insects or contains their larvae .
i too am concerned with pesticide use .
i believe that if a little diligence and common sense are used in the application and consumers rinse their produce , our food supply is the safest in history .
ralph , usa individual chemicals may seem safe when they are tested one by one over a short time scale under laboratory conditions .
but no-one can say for sure what their long-term effect will be , especially when combined with the many other chemicals present in our food and environment .
i think the co-op is doing the right thing - but expect to pay more for it !
paul , london i think this is a fantastic step towards supplying the public with a healthier option without the price of organic foods .
let 's hope the other supermarket chains do n't take too long to follow suit !
ej green , uk i am convinced that all the messing around with our food supply has made many people in this country susceptible to many new ailments mandi , uk my partner suffers from hives .
this is due to a low tolerance to additives / colours / pesticides in food .
he has had several checks and nobody can identify what it is that makes his body react .
i am convinced that all the messing around with our food supply has made many people in this country susceptible to many new ailments and aggravated the illness people already suffer from .
mandi , uk i applaud co-op ; we have yet to master the bigger things around us namely insects and plants that can all benefit our methods of production .
why are others so ignorant that they assume that if we do n't understand it we should ' spray it away ' ?
not being uniform is a celebration in nature and humanity , why are we striving for identically produce ?
fergus ross , britain as an agronomist , controlling and monitoring what is applied to products grown in the uk , i have to wonder if the british public is actually aware of how tightly controlled pesticide and other applications are .
a farmer will not spend money on very expensive applications unless he has no option other than to loose his crop .
if the consumer wishes to see shelves stocked high in the local supermarket with stunted and pest damaged products , petition your supermarket managers as it is the multinational companies ' demands for 99 % perfect products at cheap prices which drive the whole issue .
paul , uk i 'm afraid this is just another attempt to increase market share keith moffitt , switzerland i 'm afraid this is just another attempt to increase market share in the increasingly competitive supermarket area .
what the supermarkets have realised is that joe public knows a little about the downsides but nothing about the upsides .
couple this with increasing food concern -lrb- bse , e-coli in meat , salmonella in eggs , gm crops etc -rrb- and what you have is a marketing opportunity based on fear .
i think the co-op should know better but in the end it wo n't win them any friends .
it will simply cause more supermarkets to jump on the bandwagon .
keith moffitt , switzerland i think they 're right in principle , but i also hope that they do n't forget the reason for using pesticides to start with - namely to stop pests eating the food before we do .
we need to find alternative means of keeping them out of our food - just banning the pesticides with no alternative strategy is going to give the pests a free lunch .
the ban is a step in the right direction but we need to go much further .
p , uk and not before time .
these chemicals build up in the environment with unknown effects on humans , wildlife and the food chain .
they 're safe say the producers , but how many times do we have to have one withdrawn after a few years due to " unforeseen problems " before we learn .
and these same companies want to sell us gm crops that are resistant to pesticides so that even more chemicals can be dumped on the land .
we 're supposed to be this planet 's most intelligent and developed life form and it would be a pleasant change if we acted like it for once .
stephen cooke , uk well done co-op , it 's about time somebody put people above profit .
i do n't want a " perfect " onion if it 's going to give me cancer in 30 years !
maybe the supermarkets ought to rethink their supply strategies and supply each store from local producers instead of central warehouses .
it might reduce the need for preservative chemicals and also take a few trucks off the road to boot .
so what if it 's a logistical headache , it 's got to be better than slowly killing your customers .
al , uk anything that slows the use of chemicals and gm techniques is welcome karina , france anything that slows the use of chemicals and gm techniques is welcome .
until we can firmly declare that these products are safe to humans and the environment , both in terms of food and of the ensuing chain -lrb- water cycle , etc -rrb- , these products should not be in common use .
it is about time we woke up and used proper contained trials of all pesticides , fertilisers and modern genetic techniques .
karina , france i back the co-op .
it 's not just what pesticides we eat do to our health , it 's the impact they have on our countryside .
the numbers of birds and animals seen in the countryside has dropped dramatically as farming has intensified .
i want to see more small farms producing high quality food without recourse to vast quantities of chemicals .
it will provide us with better food , help revive poor rural areas , and preserve a beautiful landscape .
martyn williams , uk presumably if the co-op is so worried about our health they will ban cigarettes and alcohol as well !
smells like a pr stunt to me !
bob , england at the same time , with no sense of irony , the biotech company aventis is saying it will use legal action against the government to prevent it revealing information about the pesticides it is using on its gm crop trials .
it seems obvious that the big lie about gm -lrb- that it needs less pesticide -rrb- is about to be burst and the companies who stand to get rich from gm will do anything to suppress the facts .
the co-op has made a brave move here and i hope the other stores will follow suit .

the co-op , one of the uk 's biggest retailers , is to ban more than 20 common pesticides used in food production and restricting the use of more than 30 others .
the company said it had bowed to consumer pressure after a survey it commissioned found that more than 70 % of 1,000 people interviewed were worried about the use of pesticides .
the chemicals include " hormone disrupters " and organophosphates from the nerve gas family .
how safe is the food you eat ?
has the co-op done the right thing ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction i hope the other supermarkets quickly follow its lead michael entill , uk good for the co-op !
i hope the other supermarkets quickly follow its lead .
the co-op will have my custom until they do .
michael entill , uk i have talked to quite a few farmers on this subject and they say in the majority that pesticides are needed otherwise we would not have enough crops to feed the world population .
there should be a law passed that makes it the responsibility of the supplier to make sure the produce is cleaned to an acceptable level before it hits the shelves .
emma , usa millions of people die of liver cancer resulting from a naturally occurring fungus which grows on fruit and veg .
by contrast , all the evidence in the uk is that eating lots of fruit and veg -lrb- that 's the stuff with pesticides and fungicides in -rrb- is good for you .
this is a measure which will increase the cost of fruit and veg , and decrease public health .
ralph ryder , uk disfigured , partly damaged produce is equally nutritious paul , uk paul the agronomist outlined the key issue : there is a misconception amongst the public , partly instilled by mass-marketing campaigns displaying the perfectly symmetrical , shiny and happy fruit / vegetable .
disfigured , partly damaged produce , the reason for which pesticides are commonly used , is equally nutritious and without a regular chemical soaking , is cheaper and healthier -lrb- unless clinical trials have shown pesticides to be beneficial in some way -rrb- .
paul , uk with the increased number of people suffering from allergy related illnesses , it is surprising that governments have not been more meticulous / careful / mindful with / to the demands of the agro-petro / chemical businesses .
these concerns are there to make profits which come before the well-being of the people of this planet .
i believe that the gm controversy will have in a few years time , the same repercussions .
already we see one butterfly population is being affected in the states with the development of the gm crops .
what next ?
are we killing all living beings on this planet for our own greedy consumption ?
we live sedentary lives and we do not need to ingest the amount of calories we do daily .
the hormone disrupters , organophosphates and other chemicals used in our food chain are not necessary if only we , consumers stop to think the damage we are doing to this small planet .
danielle domingue banyai , uk pesticides are used to help farmers produce sufficient food to feed the country .
without their use where would we be ?
still having to grow our own food in gardens and having to shop every day ?
finding it difficult to combat diseases in crops , animals and even mankind ?
pesticides have made our lives what they are today .
ok pesticides may not be all good , and their bad points not totally clear , but the restraints that are already placed on farmers are vast , and why would farmers spend money to buy chemicals and then spend the time and the money to spray their crops if they did not feel it was needed .
how many other people would work from early morning to late at night for such a little return ?
many people may feel that the co-op have made the right move but what about all the other chemicals that are used in the production of other products , are they going to ban or restrict them to ?
abi , scotland a blanket ban on pesticides will only hurt those least able to secure alternative foods euan gray , uk i inherited two apple trees last time i moved .
i did n't spray them , and got a disappointing yield and plenty of insect damage .
this year , i sprayed with pyrethrum , and there are no insects on the apples and it looks like a much greater harvest .
they will still be a lot healthier -lrb- as well as tasting better -rrb- than the stuff in the local supermarket .
used responsibly , pesticides are pretty much essential to modern agriculture , but striking a balance between moderate chemical use and the encouragement of natural predators is required .
remember , though , that not everyone can afford to pay the higher prices for so-called organic foods - a blanket ban on pesticides will only hurt those least able to secure alternative foods - i.e. the poor .
euan gray , uk this is a purely marketing ploy .
chemicals that are approved in this country have been through stringent testing and are safe to use .
what expertise does the co-op have to do this type of testing ?
all they want to do to scare people when there is no reason .
they were a founder member of the approved produce scheme which was set up to ensure all fresh produce supplied to supermarkets was grown according to the best integrated crop management systems available .
already the government tests foods for chemical residues and publishes the results so why do the co-op want to repeat this ?
denis walsh , england i am saddened by some of the naive comments about " long term effects " of pesticides , and supposed " increased susceptibility " to various minor ailments .
presumably they prefer the alternatives of infant mortality , or becoming ill after some dodgy organism has had a go at their food ?
perhaps they would prefer to have the threat of famine hanging over them ?
the sanitised view of the past that some of these people hold is ridiculous - 100 years ago they would have been lucky to make it to 18 .
if they did , they would have probably lost most of their teeth by then , and their general state of health would be poor , due to their body being full of various parasites .
get a grip , people !
chris brown , uk only 100 % " safe " products from co-op , then ?
sounds like they wo n't have much on their shelves to sell soon .
bill , uk when i was in the usa , they washed the fruit to ensure no residue was left on the outside , they then waxed it to protect the outer skin .
labelling this so you just rubbed it off .
also they listed herbicides and pesticides used and labelled the box the fruit came in clearly , showing tested clear for residue and content of harmful toxins .
if this procedure is followed by all countries - ours does not by the way - regular testing by environment agencies would cancel the need for what the co-op has had to do .
without herbicides and pesticides , famine would be rife , so as long as the above is carried out there should be no problems .
graham , england this is more populist nonsense , i 'm afraid .
there 's so much needless concern about what are very small quantities of chemicals which are known to be safe -lrb- because they 've been tested and approved by the regulatory authorities -rrb- .
it 's time that so-called environmentalists actually started considering scientific evidence when making their claims : there are far more pressing concerns , such as global warming , for which the evidence is much stronger .
jim , uk there are two issues the fruit and vegetable buyer should address before worrying about pesticides .
is a fair price being paid for imported food , and is the food being imported because it is out of season here .
exploitation of growers in developing countries is a form of slavery .
if you ca n't be sure a fair price is being charged , do n't buy .
it is obscene to fly carrots thousands of miles because they are out of season here .
learn to eat what is in season .
you will have a richer and more varied diet , support local producers , and reduce global pollution .
andrew , uk we should not forget that there are good reasons for chemical use in agriculture angela , new zealand most of the posts here seem to be naively supportive of the co-op ban .
but people forget that before the introduction of pesticides , herbicides and preservatives in the early 20th century agriculture was at the mercy of the environment .
blight , fungus and pests have been responsible for famine and economic destruction throughout history .
the use of chemicals led to stable food production and the development for the first time of an economy not based on agriculture in the western world .
if pesticides were to be banned overnight , yield would decrease , quality would decrease and you could forget about getting affordable fruit in winter .
while i agree that it is time for alternatives to be better investigated such as biological control for pests and gm food .
a ban on pesticides and other agri-chemicals at this time is a foolish publicity stunt .
also lets not forget that even " organic " growers routinely use up to 50 % of pesticides and herbicides used by conventional growers .
we need to look for environmentally solutions to food production but we should not forget that there are good reasons for chemical use in agriculture .
we have a huge and growing population .
there is no quick fix to food supply .
angela , new zealand this is a valuable , wise and scientifically sound move .
many functional health problems can be positively impacted by avoiding pesticide residues .
we live , as has been said , in a soup of chemicals , many carcinogenic , and whatever the current authorities say , there is an epidemic of certain cancers .
ignoring this obvious link is no longer defensible .
dr john stanley , ireland once again the paranoia merchants are at it .
careful washing and preparation of food gives everybody a balanced diet .
the nanny state will always find some damn thing that 's bad for us .
there are far too many dome headed , sandal-wearing dipsticks around these days who have little experience of the real world but think it is their god given right to tell us all what we should be eating .
if it 's all so bad for us , then why are people living longer ?
keith simpson , uk bowing to hysterical reactions of people who imagine that the risks of crop protection products are greater than they really are could reverse progress in agricultural methods .
do these people not recognise the benefit of using pesticides , namely that more food can be produced on less land ?
or realise that the world population is growing and that world food production needs to keep up with this ?
paranoia from affluent societies could jeopardise progress .
toby bruce , uk hey there co-op , i 'm coming your way .
well done .
i 've been spending quite a lot of precious time recently growing my own vegetables due to the extortionate price of " pure organic " food .
although there are some issues with yields , this price premium is due largely to there being much more demand in the uk than supply .
the problem for farmers is the cost of conversion , during which they get all the problems of abandoning these toxic chemicals , but none of the benefits .
so let 's see some real government funding alongside the supermarkets to help farmers give up the wonder drugs and look after both our health and the health of our countryside .
simon redding , uk i am amazed that a supermarket can now dictate how food can be produced without producing anything itself .
you should immediately remove all shampoo , makeup , from the stores as they are full of chemicals .
also no garden centre should sell any plant food as that has chemicals too .
do not even think about fly sprays they contain op 's from the nerve agents .
the point is you can go over the top , that is why there are governments that monitor and test .
leave this to the fsa , not a co-op that is trying a cheap publicity stunt .
andrew cooke , uk fair play to the co-op .
many people are uneasy about the levels of pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables -lrb- pesticides are , after all , specifically designed to be inimical to life -rrb- .
perhaps if someone was able to prove that these residues are safe , rather than relying on the fact that no solid proof exists yet that pesticide residues have caused excess cancers or other diseases , the co-op would not have had to stick their neck out like this .
guy chapman , uk there are two options : 1 -rrb- no pesticides and millions dying from diseases carried by insects or 2 -rrb- use of pesticides and maybe feel a little nauseous , but then again it could just be the food preparation and not the pesticides causing you to feel nauseous as for me , i 'll take the pesticides and genetically altered foods .
technology is how our species has survived for centuries .
do we want to become extinct because it would be good for the planet ?
not me .
jw garner , usa as a doctor who is also an apple grower , i hope my thoughts deserve to be heard .
i planted a small orchard in 1993 , full of " organic " idealism .
three years later , my partner and i had to face the fact that pests and diseases were not affecting our " profits " , they were destroying everything we 'd worked for .
the trees were dying from the combined attacks of fungi , bacteria and insects and we had to choose-spray a minimal amount of chemicals or walk away from our orchard .
of course sprays should be minimised , and people should be prepared to accept both blemished fruit and higher prices , but the idea that the present world population can be fed without some use of chemicals is as unfounded as the belief that pesticide residues have been shown to cause ill health .
stephen , england wonderful news co-op i hope more people follow your example .
like many other people i know i do not want to eat food smothered in pesticides , fungicides and waxes .
ideally too i would like it to be produced locally .
i have parkinson 's disease , now a pretty common disease in uk but when parkinson first described it and gave it his name it was a very , very , very rare disease .
now it is very common in rural , agricultural areas - what is commonly unavoidable by people like me who live in rural areas - exactly , pesticide !
not proven of course , after all which chemical company would fund that research - they are too busy funding research into gm crops !
in my state of health you become very cynical i 'm afraid .
merry , uk whilst i would not necessarily advocate that all food be organic , i do believe that the balance needs to be redressed towards good husbandry and more traditional good practice .
i believe that as with many things the power of the marketing people is becoming too great and we are falling for the myth that things have to be perfect .
give me a slightly blemished apple that has not been doused in chemicals , travelled half way round the world and been stored for months anytime !
jan , england it makes me wonder exactly what supposedly natural and healthy products contain these days richard , uk occasionally , i 've eaten a piece of fruit from a supermarket and felt a bit nauseous .
it makes me wonder exactly what supposedly natural and healthy products contain these days .
yuk !
i try not to even think about the potential long-term consequences !
richard , uk surely the government should be tackling this sort of thing , rather than letting it be dealt with by non-elected organisations such as co-op .
i think that it is a good thing , i just think it is a shame that the government is shirking its responsibilities .
duncan drury , london , uk hooray for the co-op kate smith , uk hooray for the co-op .
so what if it 's a marketing ploy - for once it 's a bit of marketing that 's not selling us a logo or a " look " but is instead doing us some practical good .
and if other supermarkets join in , that 'll be great .
message for the co-op : i 'm abandoning sainsbury 's and coming to shop with you .
kate smith , uk three questions : 1 / how will they know what pesticides have been used in the production of the chinese apples , or the kenyan beans , or the south african oranges that they sell ?
simply telling their suppliers not to use certain chemicals without any form of policing sounds a bit optimistic to me .
2 / will they pay their uk suppliers a healthy supplement , to make up for lower yields .
answers on a postcard .
3 / how will they persuade the public to buy food , especially fruit , that costs more , and bears the marks of being grown " naturally " - the average shopper wants to buy produce of uniform size , shape and colour .
you do n't get that level of conformity without the use of chemicals .
john , uk i 'm all for it , whether or not it 's a publicity stunt !
i do n't want my food contaminated with pesticides -lrb- or specific weedkillers , for that matter -rrb- and value the health of my children and future generations far above saving a few pence on the price of a kilo of spuds !
not to mention the long-term damage caused to the environment generally by a build-up of chemical residues .
ros , uk i personally welcome the co-op 's decision and i hope that more leading supermarkets will follow nicola , uk in the last 2 years i have developed irritable bowel syndrome - at least that 's what i 've been diagnosed with .
in the last year both of my brothers have developed exactly the same symptoms .
more recently my boyfriend has started to suffer the same symptoms .
i have no medical expertise and i do not have a great understanding of farming practises however i am becoming increasingly concerned about the chemicals that are being used and just what is going into our food .
i personally welcome the co-op 's decision and i hope that more leading supermarkets will follow .
nicola , uk when i buy an apple , i just want a fresh , simple apple .
the fact that the supermarkets might have stored it for 3 weeks before they put it on the shelve , and realising the amount of pesticides they smear on it , makes me think that i might be better off not to eat it all !
worst still , we have to pay a penalty fare to buy the real thing -lrb- organic -rrb- , what right do the consumers have ?
also , i really think 50 % of the profit of selling an apple should go back to the good old farmers instead of the supermarket 's boss pocket .
catherine , london u.k. good on the co-op .
its about time the big suppliers took a stance , and listened to the wishes of an informed customer base and demand more natural foods from the farmers .
you only have to look at the demand for organic produce -lrb- my local tesco sells out of fresh organic produce within a couple of hours of it going on display ! -rrb- and the public resistance to gm foods to see the direction that the food debate is going in .
lets hope more of the retailers follow the co-op and force the hand of the suppliers .
dave , wales yet more paranoia being spread by the " it 's man-made , it must be harmful " types .
quite a lot of foods -lrb- parsnips , for example , and rhubarb -rrb- " naturally " contain potentially-harmful-in-massive-doses substances and would be subject to major restrictions if they were a manufactured foodstuff !
personally , i do n't worry about pesticide residues in foods , the levels are so low that 20 years ago they could n't have been measured reliably anyway .
parsnips , anyone ?
pete morgan-lucas , wiltshire , uk why would anyone want to eat food unnecessarily sprayed with chemicals that have n't been fully tested ?
i do n't want to be a part of a mass clinical trial - this is consumerism gone mad !
tm , england i feel it is necessary for me to use pesticides and fungicides ralph , usa i raise pecans in the united states .
in order for me to produce a marketable crop i feel it is necessary for me to use pesticides and fungicides .

i too am concerned with pesticide use .

ralph , usa individual chemicals may seem safe when they are tested one by one over a short time scale under laboratory conditions .
but no-one can say for sure what their long-term effect will be , especially when combined with the many other chemicals present in our food and environment .

bbc news -pipe- south asian -pipe- is bangladesh the most corrupt country in the world ?
categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : talking point : debates : south asian front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 6 july , 2001 , 07:54 gmt 08:54 uk is bangladesh the most corrupt country in the world ?
bangladesh has been named the most corrupt country in transparency international 's annual corruptions perception index of 91 countries .
hot on its heels came nigeria and uganda , while finland , denmark and new zealand emerged with glowing reports .
corruption is difficult to define and is perceived differently depending on location and culture .
but the equation is clear : the poorer countries are the most corrupt and the richer ones are relatively unstained .
some argue that corruption is a necessary part of development made more acute as the poorer countries struggle to play catch up .
perhaps richer countries simply have a different sort of corruption that is easier to camouflage .
so why is corruption so prevalent and visible in developing countries ?
is it a necessary ill ?
and how fair is it to judge countries by these standards ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction it 's poverty and poor administration that have led to such a state of affairs raja dutta , usa it 's sad but perhaps true that corruption is very much prevalent in south asia and not just in bangladesh .
it 's poverty and poor administration that have led to such a state of affairs .
bribery is a way of life and well , if the whole system is corrupt from top to bottom , one ca n't hope that things will change for the better in the near future .
raja dutta , usa given the cost of living , it is hardly surprising that the ordinary public has to resort to receiving bribes to supplement their income .
the people are not guilty , for the state of corruption , the government is .
karim chowdhury , uk how can you control corruption when the law enforcement agencies are the most corrupts of all !
musa , usa / bangladesh to find out which country is the most corrupt , we need to define the word corruption .
and if i understand the meaning correctly , then i think corruption is the only right that the local people have exercised in poor countries , whereas in developed countries this is strictly reserved for big government politicians .
we worry about the 100 rupee -lrb- or taka whatever -rrb- that a local worker demands , but fail to voice protest against the millions made by so-called " leaders " .
last time i checked , bribery was considered a part of corruption , and thinking of it , campaign finance comes to mind .
bishnu shrestha , usa / nepal the main perpetrator fuelling the corruptness is the government ibn habibur rahman , uk / bangladesh the fact that bangladesh has been nominated as the most corrupt country in the word , does not surprise me in the least .
i have been travelling regularly to and from bangladesh for the last five years , and have noticed a huge deterioration in the law and order situation .
the main perpetrator fuelling the corruptness is the government with its various bodies including the law and enforcement agencies ; i personally have experienced corruption and extortion .
on one occasion , a thug who was connected to the government -lrb- ie the ruling awami league -rrb- demanded money of me , and threatened to harass my wife if i did n't pay up .
on another occasion at the main airport -lrb- zia international airport -rrb- the police demanded money and threatened to take my wife away and do ' whatever they wanted to her ' .
as many bangladeshis will admit , being dishonest is the norm and has now become a way of life .
to speak the truth and to earn an honest living is considered abnormal .
one of the first steps to wipe out corruption would be for foreign countries to stop sending aid packages .
these aid packages mainly feed a corrupt and mismanaged government .
the ordinary layman on the street who is in need of the aid probably ends up with little or nothing of the aid packages .
ibn habibur rahman , uk / bangladesh while it might be a while before corruption is completely eliminated , a good beginning could be made by making available more services .
for instance , allowing multiple phone companies might eliminate the need to bribe the phone company officials to jump the queue .
the list is endless .
there will always be an argument made that market economies only help the rich .
i will argue back saying that only the rich can afford to bribe their way through the babu maze .
ashesh , usa corruption is our own doing ahsen ahmed , pakistan / usa corruption is our own doing .
the person who demands and the person who pays a bribe are equally responsible .
i remember once when i had to spend hours at the police station because i wanted to pay a traffic ticket and get a receipt instead of bribing my way out .
we can rid ourselves of corruption if every individual makes a sincere effort .
ahsen ahmed , pakistan / usa of course , it is difficult to measure the amount of corruption and so also determine the rank .
no doubt bangladesh will be one among top ten .
one should not forget that present bangladesh is ruling by awami league the most corrupt political party in the history of bangladesh .
bangladeshis who have seen their rule between 1972 to august 1975 are not surprised to see the rank .
chowdhury m.h. , united arab emirates it comes as no big surprise that bangladesh has come top in the world in the corruption stakes .
international aid organisations as well as governmental aid from countries all over the globe fail to realise the fundamental flaw in the way they supply aid - they entrust the government - the highest source of corruption in bangladesh - to redistribute it .
by the time those in the higher echelons of governmental hierarchy have taken their slice of the financial aid , the meagre amount that finally permeates down to those whom the aid was originally intended for is too little to make any real difference .
the only way to prevent corruption in bangladesh is to sew up the pockets of parliamentary ministers .
raza halim , united kingdom / bangladesh let 's accept corruption as a global phenomenon adnan shams , denmark / bangladesh let 's accept corruption as a global phenomenon and not only a problem of the developing world where it is more visible .
so-called research never reaches the sophisticated level of corruption in developed nations .
adnan shams , denmark / bangladesh what a strange country we live in .
i went back to bangladesh after six years on 21st april and returned to the states on 27th june .
i had decided that during this visit i would not lose my dignity by bribing someone in any situation .
but i could not keep my promise .
on my way , i was so sad to leave behind my mom , family and new wife .
but my grief was stunted when i was stopped by the immigration officer and asked to " help " him by " whatever " i could " do for him " .
i did not wanted to give him any money but also i did not want to cause any delay in my departure .
so i had give him 100 taka that i was carrying back to usa as a souvenir .
i was saddened but i also felt bad .
where is our country headed to ?
sayed , usa / bangladesh i think the method of determining corruption in different countries by ti is not scientific .
it can at the most show a degree or prevalence of corruption , even in broad comparison among nations , but it can hardly rank them first , second , third . etc with any degree of scientific validity .
m. saiful islam , bangladesh on every visit to bangladesh i have come across some form of corruption ebrahim , uk i 'm a british born bangladeshi .
on every visit to the country -lrb- five times now -rrb- i have come across some form of corruption -lrb- in dhaka , sylhet , chittagong , cox 's bazaar -rrb- - be it the police , a local official and even immigration coming back out of the country !
so it 's no real surprise from these findings .
ebrahim , uk overpopulation , poverty , meagre resources , intense competition to succeed and provide succour to near and dear ones and the concept of hoarding for next generations all promote corruption .
if every bangladeshi had a car , a telephone , a computer , a house and four square meals a day , the rate of corruption would come down and would resemble the corruption pattern in richer countries .
vivek manchanda , us / india i am not sure whether bangladesh is the most corrupt country in the world , but definitely it is corrupt .
little is said why corruption is so prevalent and how to overcome the problem .
apart from the common fact that corrupt countries are likely to be poorer countries , there is another similarity - they are more than likely once ruled by the british .
can we speculate on the reason ?
bushra , bangladesh not too long ago , a survey pointed out that bangladeshis were the happiest people on earth sourav dasgupta , usa / india not too long ago , a survey pointed out that bangladeshis were the happiest people on earth .
so is there a correlation between happiness and corruption ?
such surveys are simply good gossip issues over a cup of hot tea and warm pakoras .
other than that , they make little sense .
sourav dasgupta , usa / india corruption is in the beholder 's eyes .
entertaining politicians and government officials to strawberries and cream at wimbledon or taking them out to covent garden is a legitimate , tax-deductible expense for western businesspersons ; providing even a lunch to officialdom would be frowned upon by the common folk in the developing world , applying different norms of morals and ethics , as an unacceptable form of influencing the babus .
mohansingh , india this is not a surprise to any bangladeshi .
corruption is part of the culture now .
you assume that you will have to bribe to get anything done by the officials .
the assumption is that an official has a right to bar the passage of an application and get something in his pocket for of it .
ordinary public feels they are helpless and it is best to pay up and get things done .
at least bangladesh has beaten pakistan on this front !
alamgir khan , uk / bangladesh corruption does not allow any system to work aga rehman , usa corruption does not allow any system to work .
undeserving people get more , even the fair share of deserving ones .
richer countries may have some different kind of corruption then poor , but bottom line is the lesser the corruption , the richer the society .
aga rehman , usa acute poverty , illiteracy and police / army heavy-handedness lead to uncontrollable corruption .
an open society like india makes it worse .
there is no solution except to live with it .
narinder dogra , india corruption is perceived as a way of life in most developing countries guru shenoy , united states corruption is perceived as a way of life in most developing countries .
most people themselves lack the moral ethos of what defines social responsibility .
they are not hesitant to bribe officials in public and private sectors to expedite what they need a bit faster .
it is openly evident in the offices of any and all public utilities in south asia .
both the officials and the people bribing are simply immune to the immoral angle that accompanies this very thought and act .
countries should continue being judged along these lines , for it is the people and the entities there that define the overall culture of that country .
guru shenoy , united states the two major reasons for the prevalence of corruption in south asia are the underpaid bureaucrats , and the culture of giving ' bakshish ' -lrb- gratuity -rrb- to officials for doing their work .
the solution - increase the salaries of these bureaucrats , but the penalty for accepting bribes should be immediate suspension or termination .

ahsen ahmed , pakistan / usa of course , it is difficult to measure the amount of corruption and so also determine the rank .
no doubt bangladesh will be one among top ten .
one should not forget that present bangladesh is ruling by awami league the most corrupt political party in the history of bangladesh .
bangladeshis who have seen their rule between 1972 to august 1975 are not surprised to see the rank .
chowdhury m.h. , united arab emirates it comes as no big surprise that bangladesh has come top in the world in the corruption stakes .
international aid organisations as well as governmental aid from countries all over the globe fail to realise the fundamental flaw in the way they supply aid - they entrust the government - the highest source of corruption in bangladesh - to redistribute it .
by the time those in the higher echelons of governmental hierarchy have taken their slice of the financial aid , the meagre amount that finally permeates down to those whom the aid was originally intended for is too little to make any real difference .
the only way to prevent corruption in bangladesh is to sew up the pockets of parliamentary ministers .
raza halim , united kingdom / bangladesh let 's accept corruption as a global phenomenon adnan shams , denmark / bangladesh let 's accept corruption as a global phenomenon and not only a problem of the developing world where it is more visible .
so-called research never reaches the sophisticated level of corruption in developed nations .
adnan shams , denmark / bangladesh what a strange country we live in .
i went back to bangladesh after six years on 21st april and returned to the states on 27th june .
i had decided that during this visit i would not lose my dignity by bribing someone in any situation .
but i could not keep my promise .
on my way , i was so sad to leave behind my mom , family and new wife .
but my grief was stunted when i was stopped by the immigration officer and asked to " help " him by " whatever " i could " do for him " .
i did not wanted to give him any money but also i did not want to cause any delay in my departure .
so i had give him 100 taka that i was carrying back to usa as a souvenir .
i was saddened but i also felt bad .
where is our country headed to ?
sayed , usa / bangladesh i think the method of determining corruption in different countries by ti is not scientific .
it can at the most show a degree or prevalence of corruption , even in broad comparison among nations , but it can hardly rank them first , second , third . etc with any degree of scientific validity .
m. saiful islam , bangladesh on every visit to bangladesh i have come across some form of corruption ebrahim , uk i 'm a british born bangladeshi .
on every visit to the country -lrb- five times now -rrb- i have come across some form of corruption -lrb- in dhaka , sylhet , chittagong , cox 's bazaar -rrb- - be it the police , a local official and even immigration coming back out of the country !
so it 's no real surprise from these findings .
ebrahim , uk overpopulation , poverty , meagre resources , intense competition to succeed and provide succour to near and dear ones and the concept of hoarding for next generations all promote corruption .
if every bangladeshi had a car , a telephone , a computer , a house and four square meals a day , the rate of corruption would come down and would resemble the corruption pattern in richer countries .
vivek manchanda , us / india i am not sure whether bangladesh is the most corrupt country in the world , but definitely it is corrupt .
little is said why corruption is so prevalent and how to overcome the problem .
apart from the common fact that corrupt countries are likely to be poorer countries , there is another similarity - they are more than likely once ruled by the british .
can we speculate on the reason ?
bushra , bangladesh not too long ago , a survey pointed out that bangladeshis were the happiest people on earth sourav dasgupta , usa / india not too long ago , a survey pointed out that bangladeshis were the happiest people on earth .
so is there a correlation between happiness and corruption ?
such surveys are simply good gossip issues over a cup of hot tea and warm pakoras .
other than that , they make little sense .
sourav dasgupta , usa / india corruption is in the beholder 's eyes .
entertaining politicians and government officials to strawberries and cream at wimbledon or taking them out to covent garden is a legitimate , tax-deductible expense for western businesspersons ; providing even a lunch to officialdom would be frowned upon by the common folk in the developing world , applying different norms of morals and ethics , as an unacceptable form of influencing the babus .
mohansingh , india this is not a surprise to any bangladeshi .
corruption is part of the culture now .
you assume that you will have to bribe to get anything done by the officials .
the assumption is that an official has a right to bar the passage of an application and get something in his pocket for of it .
ordinary public feels they are helpless and it is best to pay up and get things done .
at least bangladesh has beaten pakistan on this front !
alamgir khan , uk / bangladesh corruption does not allow any system to work aga rehman , usa corruption does not allow any system to work .
undeserving people get more , even the fair share of deserving ones .
richer countries may have some different kind of corruption then poor , but bottom line is the lesser the corruption , the richer the society .
aga rehman , usa acute poverty , illiteracy and police / army heavy-handedness lead to uncontrollable corruption .
an open society like india makes it worse .
there is no solution except to live with it .
narinder dogra , india corruption is perceived as a way of life in most developing countries guru shenoy , united states corruption is perceived as a way of life in most developing countries .
most people themselves lack the moral ethos of what defines social responsibility .
they are not hesitant to bribe officials in public and private sectors to expedite what they need a bit faster .
it is openly evident in the offices of any and all public utilities in south asia .
both the officials and the people bribing are simply immune to the immoral angle that accompanies this very thought and act .
countries should continue being judged along these lines , for it is the people and the entities there that define the overall culture of that country .
guru shenoy , united states the two major reasons for the prevalence of corruption in south asia are the underpaid bureaucrats , and the culture of giving ' bakshish ' -lrb- gratuity -rrb- to officials for doing their work .
the solution - increase the salaries of these bureaucrats , but the penalty for accepting bribes should be immediate suspension or termination .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- brown calls for global health fund low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 6 july , 2001 , 08:18 gmt 09:18 uk brown calls for global health fund gordon brown will press for further measures to help the world 's poor the uk chancellor gordon brown is to urge the finance ministers of the world 's seven richest nations to set up a global health fund to fight aids , malaria and tb in developing countries .
mr brown will use the occasion of a g7 summit in rome to press for further measures to help the world 's poor , going beyond the debt relief initiative agreed two years ago in cologne .
the meeting is in advance of the g8 summit of world leaders that will take place in genoa on 20-22 july .
thousands of anti-globalisation protesters have threatened to disrupt that meeting , and mr brown is hoping that positive proposals aimed at tackling world poverty will help deflect their anger .
world economy fears the meeting is also likely to discuss the deterioration of the world economic outlook , with japan and germany both moving towards recession .
however , a senior treasury official said that the uk economy was still broadly on course to grow strongly this year , with the government seeing no reason to change its economic forecast of 2.5 % growth made in march at the budget .
he said that stronger domestic demand , as shown by retail sales and the housing market , was compensating for the weaker export markets which have hit the manufacturing industry .
the us treasury secretary believes the us economy and he pointed out that the us economy was now expected to make a soft landing , which would partly counterbalance the slowdown in germany .
paul o 'neill , the us treasury secretary , will be attending his first g7 summit , and is expected to say that the combination of tax cuts and six rate cuts by the us central bank , the federal reserve , will lead to a rapid recovery in the second half of the year .
money laundering tackled the finance ministers are also expected to tackle the problems of money laundering and tax evasion , with many small caribbean and pacific islands accused of weak supervision and harbouring illicit funds .
they are expected to endorse the conclusions of the financial action task force report , which named several havens for money laundering and threatened collective sanctions if they did not clean up their act .
and they may endorse a similar oecd report on tax evasion , which urges closer co-operation between the tax authorities in major countries and those in offshore havens .
initially the us had opposed such a deal , arguing that it was an intrusion on sovereignty - but uk treasury officials believe that they have been able to convince the us that it would be in their interest to come on board .
financial reform ?
the finance ministers will also be considering plans to reform the world financial system to make it less prone to crisis .
but they are still working out how to involve the private sector - the investors who have recently withdrawn most of their funds from third world countries .
the dilemma for the finance ministers is that they want to encourage private sector financial flows , which far outweigh government aid , to developing countries - while at the same time ensuring that taxpayers in rich countries do not bear all the costs of a bail-out if there is a financial crisis .
but uk officials admitted that progress in this area was still been painfully slow .
third world help finally , the finance ministers are likely to discuss plans to go beyond debt relief to help the world 's poor .
the meeting will be attended by james wolfensohn , the head of the world bank -who will be urged to concentrate his programmes on ensuring that the poorest people in developing countries gain access to health and education .
mr brown 's plan for a global health fund , which has already received un backing , would involve a private-public partnership between western governments , pharmaceutical companies , and charitable research foundations .
its aim would be to ensure that developing countries have access to a cheap supply of drugs .
the uk government has said it would be prepared to provide tax breaks for pharmaceutical companies that take part , and will urge other countries to do the same .
but drop the debt campaigners will be disappointed that the uk government will not back their case for further debt relief for poor countries .
uk officials say that already $ 50bn has been spent on debt relief in 23 countries , and rolling out further relief now depends mainly on the efforts of those poor countries caught in a cycle of conflict and civil war .

this is not just a fun car to drive , they argue .
it is not just an adorable shape .
this is the car that helped liberate britain forty years ago by offering affordable motoring to all .
the mini was to 1960s britain , what the vw beetle was to post-war germany .
the mini did away with class distinctions as everyone from schoolteachers to pop-stars to miniskirt-clad fashion models , were seen zipping around town in the small car designed by the now legendary alec issigonis .
the mini carried a variety of names over the years from mini minor to mini clubman to , most notably , mini cooper .
as the marques changed , fans of this small run-about multiplied , but they always agreed on one thing , this was one car deserving nothing less than iconic status .
but go to mini rallies or pop your head into your local mini owner 's club meeting -lrb- there is bound to be one -rrb- and you will notice that a split has developed in this fanatical world .
the new mini goes on sale in britain on saturday , but not all purists will be queuing up to buy it .
there is little doubt that the new mini is a good car , but there is a lot of doubt about whether it can justifiably be called a mini .
mini has had several owners over the years , but few strayed far from that basic issigoni 's design .
exploitation ?
now , bmw - the latest owners - have produced a new model which has elements of the old mini , but with a radical reshaping .
it is nothing more than a new car with mini written on it , according to the anti-new-mini camp .
bmw , they say is simply exploiting a name with a rich heritage because they know it will sell .
an outrage !
a travesty !
an insult ! , they shout .
bring back the minis we know and love !
but ask another mini fanatic and you may get a completely different view .
some readily accept that the old mini was never particularly well made , a point you can not say about the new mini .
pro-new-mini-ists also argue that at least bmw is keeping the mini name alive , rather than relegating it to scrap-heaps and rallies .
they also argue that drive the new mini , and you can not fail to be convinced that this may be a new car , but it is one worthy of such an iconic label .

as the marques changed , fans of this small run-about multiplied , but they always agreed on one thing , this was one car deserving nothing less than iconic status .
but go to mini rallies or pop your head into your local mini owner 's club meeting -lrb- there is bound to be one -rrb- and you will notice that a split has developed in this fanatical world .
the new mini goes on sale in britain on saturday , but not all purists will be queuing up to buy it .
there is little doubt that the new mini is a good car , but there is a lot of doubt about whether it can justifiably be called a mini .
mini has had several owners over the years , but few strayed far from that basic issigoni 's design .
exploitation ?
now , bmw - the latest owners - have produced a new model which has elements of the old mini , but with a radical reshaping .
it is nothing more than a new car with mini written on it , according to the anti-new-mini camp .
bmw , they say is simply exploiting a name with a rich heritage because they know it will sell .
an outrage !
a travesty !
an insult ! , they shout .
bring back the minis we know and love !
but ask another mini fanatic and you may get a completely different view .
some readily accept that the old mini was never particularly well made , a point you can not say about the new mini .
pro-new-mini-ists also argue that at least bmw is keeping the mini name alive , rather than relegating it to scrap-heaps and rallies .
they also argue that drive the new mini , and you can not fail to be convinced that this may be a new car , but it is one worthy of such an iconic label .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- seals use whiskers to track prey low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 6 july , 2001 , 09:11 gmt 10:11 uk seals use whiskers to track prey the harbour seal : can track a herring from 180 metres by bbc news online 's helen briggs scientists have discovered that a seal uses its whiskers to detect the watery trail of a swimming fish .
they say it is the first time that an animal has been shown to hunt in this way .
the animal 's highly sensitive whiskers are able to detect miniscule vibrations as fish swim by , allowing the seal to catch food in dark or murky waters .
we found that a seal was able to follow a hydrodynamic trail using its whiskers bjorn mauck , university of bonn the work was carried out by a german team , which used a miniature submarine to simulate the trail made by a swimming fish .
two captive seals were able to locate the vessel in the dark .
" we found that a seal was able to follow a hydrodynamic trail using its whiskers , " co-researcher bjorn mauck of the university of bonn , germany , told bbc news online .
" this is the first time that an animal has been shown to do this . "
mini submarine the team simulated the water movements generated by a large fish using a propeller-driven miniature submarine .
they trained henry - a male harbour seal - to locate the submarine in his pool of muddy seawater .
dolphins use a sonar system to detect prey the seal was then blindfolded with a stocking mask , and released to search for the submarine .
the researchers found that henry was able to locate the craft by the hydrodynamic trail left behind it , in 256 of 326 trials .
he could find and follow the submarine , even from a distance of about 40 metres -lrb- 131 ft -rrb- .
but when henry 's whiskers were covered with a stocking , he failed to spot the vibrations in the water .
hydrodynamic information the team repeated the experiments with another male harbour seal - nick - in an outdoor pool filled with clear fresh water .
again , the seal was able to locate the trail in 37 out of 45 trials -lrb- 82.2 % -rrb- , while he never detected the trail when his whiskers were covered .
these tests show that trail-following is only possible with unimpaired whiskers and is based on the detection and analysis of hydrodynamic information university of bonn team reporting their results in the journal science , the team wrote : " these tests show that trail-following is only possible with unimpaired whiskers and is based on the detection and analysis of hydrodynamic information . "
the question of how marine mammals track down their prey in dark or murky waters has long puzzled biologists .
dolphins , porpoises and other toothed whales use echolocation , which is similar to the sonar used on ships .
the whales generate sound waves , which bounce or echo back to them when the waves hit an object such as a fish .
they can use this information to catch food , avoid obstacles , and tell where they are .
the new study shows that for seals hunting in the dark , the movements generated as fish swim through the water are a vital information source .
herring alert until now , the accepted view was that this faculty was only important to seals at short distances , when it was very close to its prey .
the researchers believe seals might be able to detect the water movements left by a swimming herring from more than 180 metres -lrb- 196 yards -rrb- away .
a fish leaves a trail of tiny water disturbances as it swims dr mauck said the seal 's highly sensitive whiskers acted like the lateral line of a fish .
this network of sensory receptors located along the head and sides of fishes detects water and pressure changes in the surrounding water .
the precise mechanism of how the seal detects water disturbances with its whiskers is not clear .
but the german researchers think the whiskers of a swimming seal vibrate with characteristic frequencies .
this might allow the seal to detect tiny modulations to the vibrations , when it crosses a hydrodynamic trail .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- ' end whaling ban for whales ' sake ' low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 6 july , 2001 , 09:43 gmt 10:43 uk ' end whaling ban for whales ' sake ' a humpback breaks clear of the water : whalers killed more than 100,000 by bbc news online 's environment correspondent alex kirby japan says the moratorium on commercial whaling should be lifted - in order to protect whales .
it says this would deter pirate whaling , and would give the international whaling commission -lrb- iwc -rrb- complete control of the hunt .
asking whaling countries outside the commission to join it is inviting them to join a suicide club joji morishita , japanese iwc delegation japan is one of the countries leading efforts to overturn the commission 's moratorium , in force since 1986 .
it will argue its case at the iwc annual meeting in london later this month .
the argument that resuming the hunt would be in the whales ' own interest comes from a senior member of the japanese delegation to the iwc , mr joji morishita .
mr morishita , of the japanese fisheries agency , told bbc news online : " at the moment the iwc is dysfunctional .
" asking whaling countries outside the commission to join it is inviting them to join a suicide club .
stopping the pirates " but there are whaling countries that do n't belong to it .
people in the philippines , for instance , kill about 20 bryde 's whales a year .
" the indonesians kill at least 10 sperm whales annually .
this is legal whaling .
it takes place around their coasts , but it 's unregulated .
sperm whales - now hunted by japan " if the iwc ended the moratorium it might get those countries to join , and then it could regulate their catches .
" there 's another argument for lifting the ban .
the best deterrent for uncontrolled pirate whaling on the high seas is to allow limited whaling under the iwc .
" that would mean whalemeat prices went down , and pirate whaling can survive only when they 're high . "
the iwc allows some coastal communities in places like russia , north america and the caribbean to continue catching small numbers of whales to support their traditional way of life .
it calls this " aboriginal whaling " .
but it suspended commercial whaling 15 years ago amid fears that some species would not recover from centuries of hunting .
despite the moratorium , japan continues to catch whales in the name of scientific research , something the iwc rules allow .
it currently catches around 400 minke whales annually , most in the antarctic , and 50 bryde 's and 10 sperm whales in the north pacific .
the only other iwc member to disregard the moratorium is norway , which catches around 500 minkes a year off its coasts .
norway objected to the ban when it was introduced and so is not bound by it .
iceland rejoined the iwc last month and says it will resume commercial whaling , perhaps as early as next year .
independent minds japan 's critics routinely accuse it of bribing smaller members of the iwc to support it , a charge joji morishita rejects .
he told bbc news online : " japan gives development aid to more than 150 countries .
the iwc has just over 40 members .
gray whale numbers are growing " among them are several - india and argentina , for example - which receive huge amounts of japanese aid .
but they never vote with us .
" we 're specifically accused of trying to buy the votes of caribbean nations .
their most important industries are bananas and tourism .
" if they used their votes as their economy dictates , they 'd be voting with the us and europe , to keep the moratorium .
scenting success " voting with us is certainly not something decided by money . "
mr morishita believes the iwc will soon accept the arguments for " limited sustainable whaling , not like the bad old days " , though he does not think the moratorium will go this year .
he says : " the number of whales we can catch may turn out to be very small .
" but what matters is the principle - respect for science and international law . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- women still do most housework low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 6 july , 2001 , 09:51 gmt 10:51 uk women still do most housework women spend about 18.5 hours a week on chores by sarah toyne , bbc news online personal finance reporter more women may be working and have less time for housework , but they are still doing the lion 's share of household chores , according to a new study .
research from oxford university reveals that working has only a minimal impact on the amount time a woman devotes to work around the house .
women are still doing the lion 's share or three quarters of housework at home - even though they are working .
they have two burdens man-yee kan women in full-time employment spend nearly 12 hours on housework and share about 65 % of household chores at home .
men , however , spend between 5 and 7 hours a week dusting and cleaning .
simply working full-time will lead to only a minor redistribution of housework - 1.8 minutes less for each extra hour spent at paid work for men , and 5.2 minutes less for women .
income vs workload bigger reductions , however , arise when the female partner has a high income .
every £ 10,000 increase in the woman 's annual salary reduces her weekly housework time by 1.8 hours .
high salaries reduce the amount of time women spend on housework but the man 's income does not have any effect on how much contribution he makes to housework or affect his partner 's significantly .
man-yee kan , who undertook the research , spoke to bbc news online about the findings .
she said : " these results match those of previous years .
women are still doing the lion 's share or three quarters of housework at home - even though they are working .
they have two burdens . "
having a degree can help , though .
according to kan , having higher educational qualifications can lead to more " egalitarian households " .
better off ?
this is because men who have a first degree do more housework - if their partner is educated to the same standard .
whether you are married or are " living together " could have an impact on the amount of time you spend on housework .
women who co-habit spend 13.2 hours a week on chores compared to 19.2 hours for married women .
however , men who co-habit spend more time on housework than men who have tied the knot .
they spend 6.1 hours on housework a week compared to only 5.5 hours if they had walked up the aisle .

research from oxford university reveals that working has only a minimal impact on the amount time a woman devotes to work around the house .
women are still doing the lion 's share or three quarters of housework at home - even though they are working .
they have two burdens man-yee kan women in full-time employment spend nearly 12 hours on housework and share about 65 % of household chores at home .
men , however , spend between 5 and 7 hours a week dusting and cleaning .
simply working full-time will lead to only a minor redistribution of housework - 1.8 minutes less for each extra hour spent at paid work for men , and 5.2 minutes less for women .
income vs workload bigger reductions , however , arise when the female partner has a high income .
every £ 10,000 increase in the woman 's annual salary reduces her weekly housework time by 1.8 hours .
but the man 's income does not have any effect on how much contribution he makes to housework or affect his partner 's significantly .
man-yee kan , who undertook the research , spoke to bbc news online about the findings .
she said : " these results match those of previous years .
women are still doing the lion 's share or three quarters of housework at home - even though they are working .
they have two burdens . "
having a degree can help , though .
according to kan , having higher educational qualifications can lead to more " egalitarian households " .
better off ?
this is because men who have a first degree do more housework - if their partner is educated to the same standard .
whether you are married or are " living together " could have an impact on the amount of time you spend on housework .
women who co-habit spend 13.2 hours a week on chores compared to 19.2 hours for married women .
however , men who co-habit spend more time on housework than men who have tied the knot .
they spend 6.1 hours on housework a week compared to only 5.5 hours if they had walked up the aisle .

in a pamphlet published by the social market foundation think tank , mr lilley argues the law on cannabis use is " unenforceable and indefensible " .
we are forcing cannabis users into the arms of hard drugs pushers .
it is that link i wish to break peter lilley the former cabinet minister believes one of the biggest handicaps of the tories ' general election campaign was the perception that the party 's policies were negative and punitive .
drug pressure groups have welcomed the comments but the government dismissed them saying it would maintain the ban on cannabis .
mr lilley is the most senior politician to come out in favour of legalising the drug , although former cabinet office minister mo mowlam has called for it to be decriminalised .
he told bbc news : " we are forcing cannabis users into the arms of hard drugs pushers .
it is that link i wish to break . "
the conservative party needed to reach out to young people and those from ethnic minorities , who came up against this law and knew it was " ridiculous " .
widdecombe 's warning those on the authoritarian wing of the party have already moved to oppose his ideas .
shadow home secretary ann widdecombe warned : " i would myself wonder what we expect the big drug barons to do if we legalise cannabis .
" i think it 's very unlikely that they would go home .
" it 's far more likely that they would put a huge amount of their effort into marketing hard drugs and probably targeting ever younger age groups . "
rethink under mr lilley 's proposals , magistrates could licence outlets selling cannabis to over-18s .
there would be limits on the amount sold and the drug would be taxed and carry a health warning .
cultivation for personal use would be permitted .
mr lilley is not the only tory mp who is seeking to review the party 's position on drugs .
speaking on bbc 1 's question time , shadow chancellor michael portillo said the tories had to be prepared to engage in a debate about calls for the legalisation of cannabis .
saying the arguments on both sides were finely balanced , mr portillo continued : " we should be the party that is open to new thinking ... yes , we would consider this question . "
mr lilley is calling on the other leadership contenders to make it known where they stand on decriminalisation of cannabis .
not authoritarian monsters another leadership hopeful , iain duncan smith , said on question time : " let 's not immediately leap to conclusions that those who do not want to liberalise it are monsters of authoritarian nature .
" they are just people who want to protect their families and worry as we all do . "
michael ancram , ken clarke and david davis said they too currently opposed legalisation but were willing to have a debate on the issue .
mr clarke told bbc news on friday " an alternative , slightly druggie lifestyle " had emerged from relaxing cannabis law in amsterdam and kingston , jamaica , which he did not want to see in britain .
many of the same dealers currently selling drugs illegally would sell legalised cannabis , said mr clarke , who argued more people could be led onto hard drugs .
he dismissed the suggestion the issue could cause a split in the party .
charity support drugs charity release welcomed mr lilley 's comments , saying the debate on cannabis has come on " in leaps and bounds " in recent months .
the prime minister 's official spokesman said on friday : " cannabis is dangerous , it does cause medical problems , cancer , hallucinations - therefore the position has not changed . "
he added : " people are perfectly at liberty to express their views .
the government is aware that there is a debate going on .
but the government has made its position very clear . "

jennie russell-smith , who organises the gathering with her husband , said morecambe was an ideal location .
" the town itself is small enough for everyone to feel at home and all the locals embrace the festival .
" we held it in blackpool in 1996 and it did n't go down nearly as well .
" a lot of our crowd are quite old now - we have twenty-somethings through to sixty-somethings so people feel entirely safe . "
" the old people always ask the punks how they do their hair . "
deborah hollings , from morecambe tourist board , said : " people have been phoning up since christmas to ask for rooms .
' professional people ' " normally , the festival takes place at just one venue but this year it 's at four . "
hotelier jim catterall is welcoming back guests for the third year running .
" people come from all over the world for the festival .
this year i 've got swedes , israelis and south americans .
" they 're mostly professional people .
i always say in ' real life ' they 're all assistant bank managers . "
all 3,000 tickets for the festival have sold out .
it runs from friday 6 july until sunday 8 july , and features 130 bands , record stalls and djs .

in a report published on friday , the london-based group said china has put people to death not just for violent crimes , but also for offences such as bribery , embezzlement and stealing gasoline .
" the campaign is nothing short of an execution frenzy , a huge waste of human life , " it says .
ethnic uighurs in xinjiang have been executed for subversion using figures tallied from publicly available reports , amnesty international said that since an anti-crime campaign , strike hard , was launched in april , china has carried out at least 1,781 executions and passed 2,960 death sentences .
in contrast , amnesty international counted 1,751 executions in the rest of the world over the past three years .
but only a fraction of death sentences and executions in china are publicly reported and the actual number of people put to death is far higher , the group said .
' cutting corners ' amnesty international expressed fears that in their rush to produce results for the anti-crime drive , authorities risk executing innocent people .
police and prosecutors have been urged to cut corners to secure quick arrests and trials , it said .
in southern hunan province , police reported solving 3,000 cases in two days in april , amnesty international said .
and in south-western sichuan province , police reportedly said they apprehended 19,446 people in six days .
public executions " the potential for miscarriages of justice , arbitrary sentencing and the execution of innocent people is immense , " the group said .
most executions in china take place after sentencing rallies in front of massive crowds in sports stadiums and public squares .
prisoners are also paraded through the streets past thousands of people on the way to execution by firing squad in nearby fields or courtyards , it said .
death penalty crimes violent crime drugs offences separatism aiding tibet border crossings bribery pimping embezzlement tax fraud insurance fraud stealing petrol selling harmful foodstuffs disrupting the stock market a rally in yunnan province was reportedly broadcast live on state television .

in xinjiang autonomous region , in western china , where militant muslims are fighting chinese rule , authorities have executed people accused of separatism , amnesty international said .
and other regions have reportedly executed people for fraud , forging currency and " disrupting the stock market " in an effort to curb economic crime before china joins the world trade organisation .
olympic bid hundreds of people have also been executed for drug offences under the slogan " treasure life , reject drugs , " amnesty international said .
the report was released one week before the international olympic committee votes on whether beijing will host the 2008 summer olympics .
critics say chinese human rights abuses make beijing unfit to host the games .
chinese officials argue that political considerations should not be used to judge beijing 's olympic bid .

about 4,000 people are expected in the seaside resort for a series of performances , including stiff little fingers and sham 69 .
morecambe tourist board has arranged an official campsite and rooms on lancaster university campus to cope with the demand .
the first punk festival was held in morecambe in 1997 .
this year 's event marks the 25th anniversary of punk and celebrates the 1976 hey-day of bands like the sex pistols .
jennie russell-smith , who organises the gathering with her husband , said morecambe was an ideal location .
the punks ' hair attracts a lot of attention " the town itself is small enough for everyone to feel at home and all the locals embrace the festival .
" we held it in blackpool in 1996 and it did n't go down nearly as well .
" a lot of our crowd are quite old now - we have twenty-somethings through to sixty-somethings so people feel entirely safe . "

hubble 's excellent sharpness has allowed us to make this remarkable new type of observation kailash sahu observations of the star cluster m22 have revealed six unusual so-called microlensing events caused by passing planets some 80 times larger than the earth , a small object by cosmic standards .
the results are so surprising that they will have to be confirmed by follow-up hst observations .
but scientists say if they are verified , the discovery could yield new insights about how stars and planets form .
smallest ever detected " hubble 's excellent sharpness has allowed us to make this remarkable new type of observation , successfully demonstrating our ability to see very small objects , " said kailash sahu of the space telescope science institute .
microlensing occurs when a background star brightens for a while as a foreground object drifts in between it and us .
the objects thought to cause these events are far too dim to be seen directly , but they can be detected by the way their gravity deflects and amplifies light from a distant background star .
between february and june 1999 , astronomers monitored the 83,000 stars of m22 to look for any brightening .
they detected just one clear microlensing event caused by a normal star in the cluster .
it appeared to grow ten times brighter before it returned to its normal brightness after 18 days .
early universe but in addition to the " normal " microlensing event , astronomers recorded six unexpectedly brief events where a background star jumped in brightness by as much as a factor of two for less than 20 hours .
this means that the microlensing object must have been much smaller than a normal star .
these short durations can be explained if the mass of the intervening object is about 80 times that of earth .
objects this small have never before been definitely detected by the microlensing technique .
if these results are confirmed by follow-up hst observations , the bodies would be the smallest celestial objects ever seen that are not orbiting any star .
researchers say they might be planets that were gravitationally torn away from parent stars in the cluster .
" since we know that globular clusters like m22 are very old , this result opens new and exciting opportunities for the discovery and study of planet-like objects that formed in the early universe , " said nino panagia of the european space agency .
the research is reported in the journal nature .

the conductor would not sign his contract until he received assurances of better pay for the orchestra 's musicians - who are paid less than most of their german counterparts .
i think we can be optimistic about the future berlin philharmonic spokesman sir simon was also supporting those who were trying turn the orchestra into an independently run foundation , with more say over its own finances .
now the berlin parliament has passed the necessary laws to turn the orchestra into a foundation - and promised it more money .
' subsidies ' a spokesman for the berlin philharmonic told bbc news online : " a law has now been passed by the berlin parliament , and the law says the berlin philharmonic will be a ' foundation of public law ' .
" and an additional draft contract has passed the berlin parliament - a contract between the berlin philharmonic and the county of berlin , guaranteeing the orchestra subsidies of dm27.2 to dm28.8m -lrb- £ 8.3 to £ 8.8m -rrb- .
" it has only to pass a committee of the berlin parliament , any day now - it 's 95 % done . "
the moves have been a priority of the new berlin mayor klaus wowereit , after progress had been delayed by the recent collapse of the city 's ruling coalition .
the orchestra spokesman said : " of course we are happy - we have to see the final documents but i think we can be optimistic about the future .
" this has been one of the conditions that sir simon rattle made , to sign the contract .
" he is now set to take over in september 2002 . "
sir simon 's spokeswoman in britain declined to comment on the situation .
