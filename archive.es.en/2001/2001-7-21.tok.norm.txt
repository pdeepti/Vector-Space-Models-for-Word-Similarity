argentina would almost certainly default on its debt and could well be forced to devalue .
as it is , some argue that it will be extremely difficult for argentine exports to compete unless there is some kind of devaluation .
pressure to devalue president fernando de la rua has sworn that he will never devalue because he says that would hurt the poor far more than the present 13 % cuts in public sector salaries and pensions .

a little happiness goes a long way by education correspondent mike baker so , for most of us , the school holidays have arrived .
children are delighted , teachers exhausted and parents have the mixed pleasures of looking after the kids for the next six weeks .
it might be instructive to compare parents ' priorities with those of government ministers for some this end of term is particularly momentous as it marks either the end of primary school or an end to schooldays altogether .
this week my youngest child left primary school .
ending 10 years as a parent at the local primary feels like one of those moments of no return , rather like hitting 40 -lrb- or so people tell me ! -rrb- or meeting your daughter 's first boyfriend .
so this past week , we 've had our final school concert , the last sports day and , on friday , the leavers ' assembly .
all this set me reflecting on what , as a parent , i had valued most about my daughters ' primary school .
parents ' attitudes to my own surprise , the first things i thought of were the many extra-curricular activities , especially the music and sport , provided by enthusiastic teachers .
of course , the generally high quality of teaching was right up there too as was the fact that my children were happy at school .
on the negative side , i regret the fact that my children were in very large classes throughout and sometimes faced a change of teacher mid-year .
as i drew up my own list , i was interested to read the story on bbc news online this week about how head teachers are increasingly turning to market research consultants to assess parents ' attitudes to schools .
schools are happy to hand over up to Â£ 500 to get this detailed information on what their parents are thinking .
teaching quality despite the school league tables , the surveys seem to suggest that test and examination results are rated only 10th in parents ' list of priorities .
that ought to be a sobering message to those head teachers who get over-anxious about league table performance .
by contrast , parents said their top priorities were : teaching quality , children 's happiness , and school discipline .
this concern over " teaching quality " should be a warning to the government about the seriousness of the current problems of teacher recruitment .
if , as looks likely , the teacher shortage is more severe than ever in secondary schools in september , we can expect a sharp dip in parental satisfaction .
these surveys , based on secondary schools , contained a few other surprises .
the availability of text books , for example , was well down the list at 18th whereas communication between school and parent was rated as high as 8th .
global trend it might be instructive to compare parents ' priorities with those of government ministers .
the differences might help show which policies governments should be following at a time when all political parties claim they are acting in the interests of parents .
last month a report from the think tank the adam smith institute - a class act : world lessons for uk education , by stephen pollard - noted that , after years of state control and monopoly provision in education , governments all over the world were turning instead to " the empowerment of parents and diversity of provision " .
in the us , new zealand , denmark and sweden , the emphasis on parental choice is leading to new types of privately-run , publicly-funded schools designed to meet the needs of parents who are dissatisfied with the schools the state system offers them .
the schemes vary but they boil down to the fact that the taxpayer funds a child 's school place whether they choose to stay in the state system or go elsewhere .
in britain we have been moving slowly towards greater parental choice and when the new school year starts in september the government will publish its plans to create more diversity in secondary schooling .
no say but does all this really mean that governments are listening to parents ?
does creating a wider variety of secondary school types actually increase the choice of schools available to parents in their local areas ?
i 'm not convinced .
let us assume that parents ' views were decisive in determining local school systems .
what would they choose ?
after all , there are no plans to ask parents what types of school they want .
they get no say over whether their local school should specialise in technology rather than the arts or languages .
and how many sponsors of city academies will seek the views of the local community before setting the mission for their new school ?
but , just for a moment , let us assume that parents ' views were decisive in determining local school systems .
what would they choose ?
if the market research surveys are representative , they suggest that parents put a higher priority on broad themes , such as good teaching and discipline , rather than on how well funded they are or what category of school they fall into .
so pupil happiness , discipline , caring teachers , control of bullying , developing pupils ' self-confidence and strong moral values all rated higher with parents than priorities such as the standard of facilities , access to computers and availability of books .
options even more pertinently for the government , parents put the choice of subjects on offer in a school at only 14th in their ranking of priorities .
so when choosing a secondary school maybe parents care less about what their children will study than the environment they will be in .
in short , they may not mind whether the school specialises in technology , the arts , or business , but they do care whether the school is well-run , orderly , free of bullying , happy and welcoming to pupils and parents alike .
perhaps what they are saying is , quite simply , that they are happy so long as their local comprehensive is a good one .
so , instead of encouraging specific new categories of schools , the government might look instead at ways of allowing parents to say what sort of schools they want - including the option of keeping a standard comprehensive .

i will not attend this illegal meeting president wahid the move came at the end of the first day of an impeachment hearing which could result in the country 's first democratically elected president being voted out of office within a matter of days .
but mr wahid has declared that he will not resign , and that he will not appear before the assembly .
he has accused parliament of acting illegally and without justification and , although he said there was still time for compromise , he also warned there could be a violent reaction from his supporters around the country if he were forced out of office .
the situation on the streets is tense the bbc jakarta correspondent richard galpin says this is an extraordinary turn of events for mr wahid , who came to power in 1999 on a wave of euphoria .
he was seen as a leader who could unite the nation after years of turmoil caused by the asian economic crisis and the violent overthrow of the former authoritarian ruler , suharto .
a special session of the national assembly -lrb- mpr -rrb- , voted by an overwhelming majority to summon the president to answer allegations of corruption and incompetence .
a small number of mps abstained in the vote , and members of mr wahid 's minority national awakening party stayed away .
wahid : pondering " many options " but the 38-member bloc representing the military and police voted against the president .
in a nationally televised news conference just before parliament began its proceedings , the president renewed a threat to declare a state of emergency .
this would give him wide powers and allow an early election - if he could not reach a political deal with his opponents by 31 july .
no violence mr wahid appealed to his followers not to turn to violence - but warned that the popular mood might be hard to control .
general ismail 's appointment spurred parliament into action " if they -lsb- go ahead with impeachment -rsb- , do n't blame me if the crowd takes care of everything by themselves , " he said .
he refused to be drawn on when or whether he would declare a state of emergency .
" i have many options .
i wo n't tell what i will do .
but i will do something , " he said .
if mr wahid is voted out of office , vice president megawati sukarnoputri is likely to take over , but she has made no comment on the present stand-off .

" stern action will be taken by troops for any anarchical actions , " said jakarta police spokesman , adjunct chief commissioner anton bahrul alam .
on friday , mr wahid went ahead with the controversial installation of a new police chief - though only in a temporary capacity - and this is what appears to have prompted mps to bring forward the impeachment proceedings .
these had been due to begin on 1 august .
the appointment of general chaeruddin ismail followed the refusal of general suroyo bimantoro to step down , despite being sacked by mr wahid .

british nuclear fuels ltd -lrb- bnfl -rrb- said uranium powder had been washed from a number of corroded drums at a store complex at the chapelcross plant , near annan , dumfries and galloway .
it follows an incident when 24 fuel rods fell from a machine during a routine refuelling operation on a reactor on 5 july .
an operation is currently under way to retrieve the rods from within the sealed container .
bnfl said the latest incident has been rated as level one - the lowest level on the international nuclear event scale .
it said " a small quantity " of uranium powder escaped from corroded drums which had been kept in a store complex in the chapelcross plant .
the company insists that workers were not exposed to the material and the incident posed no risk to the public .
it is understood that a blocked gutter within the store complex , combined with heavy rainfall , had caused water to seep down an internal wall .
the storage drums corroded and , as a result , the uranium powder seeped through the wall of the building .
the health and safety executive have been informed about the incident and a clean-up operation is currently underway .
after the previous incident , labour mp for dumfries russell brown said he had been assured by plant bosses that there were no signs of increased radioactivity readings , and fuel rods involved in the incident appeared to be undamaged .

his national awakening party -lrb- pkb -rrb- had captured only 51 seats in the 500-seat lower house of parliament .
many saw his nomination by parliament 's power brokers as an attempt to block the election of megawati sukarnoputri , whose democratic party of struggle -lrb- pdi-p -rrb- was the largest parliamentary party with 153 seats .
she had to settle for the post of vice-president .
now megawati , daughter of indonesia 's populist founding leader sukarno , has become president .
so how did relations between the muslim leader president and the parliament -lrb- mpr -rrb- sink to such a low point ?
the formal reason is two charges of corruption against the president , notwithstanding the attorney-general 's declaration that there is no evidence to support the charges .
in fact , the mpr wanted to dismiss the president because it believed he was ineffectual .
mpr leaders point to his failure to tackle separatist unrest and the country 's economic problems , and what they have described as his " erratic " leadership style .
the mpr 's chosen method of impeachment - since no procedure exists under the constitution - was to dismiss him by rejecting the accountability statement they require him to make .
the president says he was not obliged to make the statement every year .
he counter charges that the mpr over-reached its authority by trying to hold him , the nation 's chief executive , to account .
some analysts are inclined to see this power struggle as left over business from the overthrow in 1998 of long-term dictator suharto , who had used parliament as a rubber stamp .
in return , it never questioned his authority .
what changed things was the country 's first democratic elections in four decades , held in june 1999 , which in theory made elected parliamentarians accountable to the people .
the subsequent presidential elections should then have made the president accountable to the upper house of parliament that elected him .
critics of the procedure believe the constitution should have been amended after suharto 's fall to clarify the lines of accountability between the executive and legislature , and to reduce the previously untrammelled power of the president .
another analysis suggests that , after being elected , wahid failed to return the favour by offering key roles to members of the parties that had helped to elect him .
political patronage , sometimes described as cronyism , is a strong tradition in indonesian politics .
mr wahid fired key figures and brought in his own associates to stamp his personal mark on government .
the fact that his government can point to few major achievements led to demands that he should have built a more representative cabinet , and delegate executive power to his deputy , megawati .
traditionalists v modernists yet another analysis sees the political struggle in terms of islam , the religion of the majority of indonesians .
wahid , who formerly led the nahdlatul ulama , a mass islamic movement , represents the traditionalists , while amien rais who - as mpr chairman - led impeachment demands , is a prominent modernist who leads the muhammadiyah movement .
according to this theory , the modernists are now in the ascendant after the traditionalists failed to deliver on their promises .
the political crisis is probably a result of all these factors - constitutional confusion as to where ultimate power resides , a failure to reward political favours by sharing power and an inter-islamic struggle .
its outcome will have an important impact on how indonesia is governed in future .

critics of the procedure believe the constitution should have been amended after suharto 's fall to clarify the lines of accountability between the executive and legislature , and to reduce the previously untrammelled power of the president .
another analysis suggests that , after being elected , wahid failed to return the favour by offering key roles to members of the parties that had helped to elect him .
political patronage , sometimes described as cronyism , is a strong tradition in indonesian politics .
mr wahid fired key figures and brought in his own associates to stamp his personal mark on government .
the fact that his government can point to few major achievements led to demands that he should have built a more representative cabinet , and delegate executive power to his deputy , megawati .
traditionalists v modernists yet another analysis sees the political struggle in terms of islam , the religion of the majority of indonesians .
wahid , who formerly led the nahdlatul ulama , a mass islamic movement , represents the traditionalists , while amien rais who - as mpr chairman - led impeachment demands , is a prominent modernist who leads the muhammadiyah movement .
according to this theory , the modernists are now in the ascendant after the traditionalists failed to deliver on their promises .
the political crisis is probably a result of all these factors - constitutional confusion as to where ultimate power resides , a failure to reward political favours by sharing power and an inter-islamic struggle .
its outcome will have an important impact on how indonesia is governed in future . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's richard galpin " he could now be voted out of office within days " president wahid , highlights his support within the country see also : 21 jul 01 -pipe- asia-pacific parliament moves to topple wahid 20 jul 01 -pipe- asia-pacific wahid appoints new police chief 17 jul 01 -pipe- asia-pacific jakarta police mount show of strength 16 jul 01 -pipe- asia-pacific wahid faces early impeachment 13 jul 01 -pipe- asia-pacific armed police defy wahid 12 jul 01 -pipe- asia-pacific police feud symbolic of chaos 31 may 01 -pipe- asia-pacific analysis : indonesia 's power vacuum 30 may 01 -pipe- asia-pacific analysis : testing indonesia 's democracy internet links : about the indonesian government bbc news online : indonesian elections 99 indonesian human rights commission the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : blaze kills 42 in indonesian bar china vows to overhaul courts koreas trade fresh war of words philippines church apologises for sex abuse search for ' spy ' pilots in china chinese chemical spill kills 13 malaysian state passes islamic law vietnam 's unburied soldiers head home links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

dr klaus toepfer , unep 's director , said developing countries were not being heard as they needed to be .
people in the rich world should realise it was the poor who bore the costs of their lifestyle , and making the connection was " a moral necessity " , he said .
dr toepfer , who is attending the talks on finalising the workings of the global climate treaty , the kyoto protocol , was speaking to bbc news online .
he said he had found the atmosphere at the meeting very constructive , but he thought it could succeed only if it found the way to compromise .
" if i had addressed the conference " , dr toepfer said , " i 'd have told the delegates it is not a matter of whether we can agree , but that we must .
the consequences for sustainable development of what is decided here will be dramatic .
" nature is not reacting like a simple on-off switch .
you can come to meetings like this intent on proving that you 're 100 % right , or you can come with a will to compromise and integrate other people 's viewpoints .
" what it needs is responsible compromise , linked to environmental integrity and sustainable development . "
unep is responsible for much of the science that underpins the climate talks : with the world meteorological organisation , another un body , it set up the intergovernmental panel on climate change .
the ipcc , which represents a broad scientific consensus , has recently published a report warning of the probable consequences if the human contribution to climate change continues unchecked .
dr toepfer said : " i 'm glad the ipcc 's approach is a transparent one , of always bringing new facts into the picture .
" it 's always open to new information , and to the possibility of being proved wrong .
" as a scientist you can ask for your position to be verified or falsified - and the search for verification does not amount to being proved scientifically right .
" but the possibility of being proved wrong is not an excuse for inaction .
" complete information is a divine attribute .
if you 're just asking for better information and not acting , then you 're misusing science . "
hidden costs dr toepfer said he tried to persuade people that it was " a moral necessity to realise the externalisation of costs .
" take an example .
when we drive our cars in europe , we need to realise that that has an impact , a cost , which is borne by people who suffer the weather extremes our lifestyle is causing .
" our hq is in africa , and we are seeing an increase in abnormal weather there , which we believe is linked to climate change .
" africa has 14 % of the world 's people , yet its share of global carbon emissions is just 3.2 % .
it 's very hard to say whether the northern countries are listening to what africa and the rest of the developing world are telling them here .
" africa certainly is not being heard as much as it needs to be .
but it is more and more of a factor in the arguments . "
dr toepfer said unep was discussing the possibility of establishing an independent african environmental protection agency .
