the ruling coalition won on a platform promising harsh economic reforms that mr koizumi said would be explained in detail after the election was over .
but as he celebrated the victory , industrial output figures for june were released showing a fall of 0.7 % from may , compared with earlier forecasts of a 0.3 % rise .
that pushed the nikkei 225 index of leading shares down 203 points to 11,594 .
the yen fell to an eight-day low against the dollar of 124.7 .
koizumi 's challenge mr koizumi 's victory in the elections for the upper house of parliament show there is broad support for his promise of harsh economic and fiscal reforms .
but since mr koizumi coalition government was elected in late april , there has not been any restructuring of the world 's second largest economy which has been in a decade-long slump .
the financial markets will be watching to see if he returns to traditional japanese policies of emergency budgets or takes a new tack .
output figures " june industrial output fell 0.7 % , its fourth consecutive month of decline , " the ministry of trade & industry said .
" production is on a downward trend , " it said .
" we must monitor the situation carefully . "
output by industry would decline 2.3 % in july but rise 3.4 % in august , the government forecast .
the stock market fell on speculation that mr koizumi 's reform package includes plans to force banks to write-off bad debts and slash government spending on costly public works projects .
one upshot might be an increase in unemployment , which is already at a record high of 4.9 % .

with the uk economy settling in for a long , slow summer , several thousand jobs have already been lost in telecoms , technology and the media .
but even as workers fear layoffs , there are some sectors that will escape the worst of any economic downturn .
these sectors , such as luxury goods , pharmaceuticals and utilities , may not only provide slightly more job security but are also likely to attract more investors .

" fortunately , people still have the good grace to get ill , even during a recession .
some might say even more so , " barclays investment manager henk potts said of glaxo smithkline 's strong results .
food manufacturers , retailers and utilities will also be cushioned from the worst effects of any recession .
" no matter what happens , people need their services , " martin evans , head of european research at credit lyonnais said .

" what the market is looking for is clear , visible earnings stream .
we have gone through this whole business of promising earnings ... what we want is companies that make money , " barclay 's henk potts said .
but the changing nature of the food retail business could however mean that this sector - already hit by intense competition on price - could be more vulnerable .
increasingly , the big retailers - such as tesco , sainsbury 's and asda - rely on non-food sales to boost their profits .
" this means elements of the sales revenue of food retailers that is more sensitive to changes in economic cycle , " verdict 's richard hyman said .

" at face value , you would imagine that it is the luxury end that might get hit the most , people might want to do without that £ 1,000 suit , the reality is that most people that can afford to buy a £ 1000 suit can still afford it during the recession . "
similarly , champagne companies are unlikely to see sales fall .
" generally the people who are drinking high volumes of champagne are n't ones who are going to be particularly badly hit by recession , " datamonitor 's drinks analyst neil broom said .
in fact , drinks companies generally will find that they sell the same volume of booze , but most of it will be shifted in off licences and supermarkets than in pubs , clubs and restaurants .
testing times but crucially , how a company handles life in a recession is as much as a symptom of how healthy a company it is as the strength of the sector it operates in .
" some companies will clearly see a downturn as an opportunity to win market share and business from weaker and smaller companies but that would be across a range of industries , " credit lyonnais 's martin evans said .

the measures have been put forward by president fernando de la rua in an attempt to balance the budget , stimulate economic growth and calm the fears of international investors .
they include radical cuts in public sector salaries , spending cuts and tax increases .
with unemployment at almost 18 % , argentina is facing what some analysts have described as the worst social crisis in the country 's history .
