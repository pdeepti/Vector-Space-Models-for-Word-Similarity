mci reported an operating loss of 6bn yen -lrb- £ 34m ; $ 48.5m -rrb- for the april-june quarter , compared with a profit of 15.3bn yen a year earlier , and way below market expectations of a 5bn yen profit .
the firm 's shares plunged by more than 9 % in early trading on thursday .
mci blamed slack demand for mobile handsets in japan and abroad , and delays in new product development .
3g woes mci , which plans to sell 22 million handsets globally this year , has budgeted 142.1bn yen for research and development as it tries to stake out a leadership position in third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile services .
the company 's president , yasuo katsura , said mci was unlikely to turn a profit from 3g phones before the end of 2003 .
mci is manufacturing 3g phones for japanese telehpone company ntt docomo , which is running trials of the world 's first 3g network in tokyo .
now , mci says it may have to retrench .
" we have tried to expand all of our businesses , but we 've come to a point where we have to review that stance , " said mitsuo hashimoto , an mci director .
cutting costs asked whether there is a possibility that a plant will be closed , mr hashimoto said : " there may be a possibility after the review , but we are not thinking about that at this point . "
mr hashimoto said forming a partnership to share the steep development costs was a possibility , but he gave no details .
mci revised down its earnings forecast for the april-september period , projecting a net loss of 18.5bn yen against a profit of 5bn yen .
the figure compared with a 21.4bn yen net profit for the same period a year ago .

shares in the japanese unit of the us fast-food giant mcdonald 's corp first traded at 4,700 yen -lrb- £ 27 ; $ 38 -rrb- , up 9.3 % from its initial price of 4,300 yen , providing one of the few bright spots for the feeble tokyo stock market , which has recently traded around 16-year lows .
but while individual investors were keen to buy into a brand that has become familiar on the japanese market , institutional funds were less eager .
big investors worried that the unit 's weak profits did not justify its flotation price , which values the company at 38.9 times its earnings , high compared with its rivals .
" popularity among retail investors made this price possible .
but i 'm not so sure about its medium- and long-term performance , given the falling growth in its earnings , " said shuji terao , senior portfolio manager at mitsui marine asset management .
" there is a fear that its share in the burger market is already so large that there is some concern about how much more it can expand , " said michael jacobs , analyst at dresdner kleinwort wasserstein .
big burgers mcdonald 's japan , which opened its first store 30 years ago in the heart of tokyo 's ginza shopping district , operates 3,678 outlets , making it the largest restaurant and burger chain in the country .
the firm says its listing on tokyo 's jasdaq market , its first flotation on a foreign stock exchange , will enable it to triple the size of its business in japan .
the company plans to build on its already huge japanese network with new restaurants in schools , hospitals and even on the world-famous bullet train .
mcdonald 's japan is currently 55 % owned by the us parent and 41 % by the family of den fujita , its president .
sales of mcdonald 's japan totalled 357.9bn yen last year .

since the collapse of the soviet union , the us has tried to refocus its defence policy to deal with the new realities and new threats of the post-cold war era .
instead of a world where conflict was defined by the standoff between two superpowers , the us security community now sees a world defined by internal security , small-scale conflicts and asymmetric threats .
biological weapons in the hands of rogue states or terrorists are just one of the threats the us sees in the murky post-cold war world .
' dark winter ' in june , us authorities staged a war game called " dark winter " to see how authorities would deal with a biological weapons attack that unleashed the smallpox virus .
john hamre of the centre for strategic and international studies told congress on monday that such an attack would cripple the us , adding , " no city , no state is capable of dealing with an incident like this . "
by the end of the simulation , the disease had spread to 25 states and 15 other countries .
the last reported case of smallpox in the us was in 1949 , and the country ended its vaccination programmes in 1972 .
the nation does not have enough vaccine on hand to deal with a national outbreak , and in the war game , rioting broke out after supplies of the vaccine were exhausted .
after hearing the testimony , republican congressman benjamin gilman said , " sadly , events of the last few years , with bombings ... in new york , oklahoma city , have transformed the bio terrorism debate from the question of ' if ' to the seeming inevitability of ' when ' . "
homeland security the bombing of the murrah federal building in oklahoma city and the world trade centre in new york , as well as the sarin gas attack on the tokyo subway by the aum shinrikyo cult helped spur more emphasis on domestic preparedness , said michael wermuth , a terrorist expert .
mr wermuth heads the gilmore commission , which looks at how the us would respond to a terrorist attack involving chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear -lrb- cbrn -rrb- weapons .
the threat from a cbrn attack come from two sources , either from another country or from a non-state actor such as a terrorist group or a lone wolf such as timothy mcveigh , he said .
the us has plans in place to deal with such an attack from another country , but it does not have a national plan in place to deal with an attack from a terrorist group at home , mr wermuth said .
fortunately , according to non-classified information , only nation states have the resources for chemical , biological or nuclear weapons .
but " while such an attack is a fairly remote possibility , the consequences of such an attack are of a magnitude we can not ignore the threat , " he said .
threat exists and the threat of biological weapons exists both from other states today and , in the future , possibly from terrorist organisations , says ken alibek .
mr alibek was the deputy director of biopreparat , the civilian arm of the russian biological weapons programme .
although the soviet union signed the biological weapons convention , it had a high-intensity programme to develop and produce biological weapons duting the 1980s and early 1990s , mr alibek said .
the programme employed more than 60,000 people and produced tons of anthrax , smallpox and plague for weapons .
but in the 21st century , mr alibek believes that the real threat will not come from an adversary or enemy capable of starting a total war such as the world wars of the 20th century .
instead , " we will see low intensity conflicts and terrorism on different levels , " he said , adding that biological weapons presented significant advantages .
" they are cheap , relatively easy to produce and relatively easy to deploy , " he said .
us must act but whether the threat comes from other nations or terrorists , the us must act with respect to the biological weapons convention , according to arms control experts .
some arms control experts had misgivings about the draft protocol for implementing the ban on biological weapons , including michael moodie , the president of the chemical and biological arms control institute .
" my view is if the protocol was adopted it would n't make the world safer , " he said .
but he added the worst outcome now is for the us to do nothing .
" the us has got to come out with realistic hard-edged package of measures , " he said .

how realistic is the prospect of economic recovery ?
" the big issues remain how to finance the budget deficit ... and partly how the strengthen the currency " , said laksono widodo , head of research at ing barings in jakarta .
the problem of the budget deficit has its origins in indonesia 's gigantic foreign debts - which have become even more expensive to service as the currency has weakened .
the government must service $ 135bn of foreign debt .
indonesia 's external debt is 110 % of gdp in 2001 and the budget is 5 % in deficit , said mr widodo .
no quick fix " this is not a problem that can be tackled overnight , not even in a year , " said ferry hartoyo of vickers ballas investment reasearch in jakarta .
the markets are waiting to see the new president 's cabinet the solutions hinge on planned cuts in subsidies , asset sales and a stronger currency .
to implement them the government will have to take " decisions that may not be politically popular " such as cutting in subsidies of fuel and electricity which will lead to price rises , said mr hartoyo .
currency stabilisation the central bank is pinning its hopes on currency stabilisation .
the rupiah rose more than 10 % in the two days after news that parliament had voted to replace president abdurrahman wahid .
on 26 july , it was trading steady at around 10,000 in the dollar , its strongest level in months .
bank indonesia deputy governor achjar iljas said a stronger currency could pave the way for interest rate cuts .
rates have been raised six times this year .
a stronger rupiah would also lead to it " less pressure on inflation " , he said .
if the rupiah strengthens against the dollar , the cost of debt repayment will lessen , interest rates will come down and asset values will rise , making a planned sale of $ 50bn of assets more likely to succeed .
an improved exchange rate would have " a multitude of effects on a lot of micro and macro numbers " , said mr widodo .
it would enable both government and companies to make credible budgets and allow companies to begin debt restructuring talks with banks , he said .
if it led to interest rate cuts it would cheapen the cost of future borrowing .
the big issues remain how to finance the budget deficit ... and partly how to strengthen the currency laksono widodo , ing barings political stability whether the rupiah can continue to strengthen depends on political stability , in particular on the stability of megawati sukarnoputri 's cabinet , analysts say .

" they 'll fight over key positions " , he said .
imf tensions ease indonesia 's relationship with the international monetary fund appears to be improving .
last week a senior imf official in jakarta said a $ 400m loan frozen since last december could be paid out as soon as august .
the loan was frozen because the indonesian bank restructuring agency had failed to sell a 30 % stake in the country 's biggest retail bank on schedule .
ibra is charged with disposing of banking assets worth about $ 50bn .
now the imf has given ibra until september , said mr hartoyo .
" they 've become more lenient " , he said .
" i think it 's because they have no choice " , said roy santoso of kim eng securities in jakarta .
" going back three or four months all the signs were on the wall that the new president was not going to last ... they have to deal with the new cabinet . "
restructuring costs the ibra demonstrates the impact of political instability on economic renewal .
the government ran up $ 65bn of foreign debt to recapitalise the banks but assets have yet to be sold to ease the burden .
in june , ibra acquired its fourth head in one and a half years - i putu gde ary suta , who does not have the confidence of the markets because of his lack of experience in debt restructuring .
asset sales have yet to take place because " nobody is willing to sign on the dotted line because you may be accused of corruption at the end " due to political jockeying , says mr santoso .
foreign investment indonesia badly needs foreign capital for its long-term development , but analysts say corruption and nepotism are rife and indonesia must sort out its legal system before foreign investors will return .
" to grow the economy , you need investments , you need political stability .
it 's fairly simple , it just requires these people to get their act together and just do it " , said mr hartoyo .
another worry for investors is the weak currency , which lowers the value of their investments .
" the rupiah will trade on the politics more than the economy " , said mr wood .
" if there 's any sign of the new government making decisions and it following it through then the rupiah could rally significantly . "
but if fragile markets and political divisions persist , it could be a long time before the economy revives .

how realistic is the prospect of economic recovery ?
" the big issues remain how to finance the budget deficit ... and partly how the strengthen the currency " , said laksono widodo , head of research at ing barings in jakarta .
the problem of the budget deficit has its origins in indonesia 's gigantic foreign debts - which have become even more expensive to service as the currency has weakened .
the government must service $ 135bn of foreign debt .
indonesia 's external debt is 110 % of gdp in 2001 and the budget is 5 % in deficit , said mr widodo .
no quick fix " this is not a problem that can be tackled overnight , not even in a year , " said ferry hartoyo of vickers ballas investment reasearch in jakarta .
the solutions hinge on planned cuts in subsidies , asset sales and a stronger currency .
to implement them the government will have to take " decisions that may not be politically popular " such as cutting in subsidies of fuel and electricity which will lead to price rises , said mr hartoyo .
currency stabilisation the central bank is pinning its hopes on currency stabilisation .
the rupiah rose more than 10 % in the two days after news that parliament had voted to replace president abdurrahman wahid .
on 26 july , it was trading steady at around 10,000 in the dollar , its strongest level in months .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- profile : hamzah haz categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : asia-pacific front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 26 july , 2001 , 06:56 gmt 07:56 uk profile : hamzah haz hamzah haz was chosen for islamic balance the new indonesian vice president , hamzah haz , said in 1999 that no woman was fit to head the world 's leading muslim nation .
now , he has been elected deputy to its first female president - the same woman he blocked two years ago .
megawati 's party won by far the most votes in the 1999 parliamentary elections , but did not have a clear majority .
her hopes for the presidency were dashed because of a muslim alliance against her .
mr haz , as leader of the third largest party in parliament , the muslim-based united development party -lrb- ppp -rrb- , played an important part in megawati 's defeat - and then lost out to her in the vote for vice-president .
but with the impeachment of president abdurrahaman wahid on 23 july , mr haz got another chance , defeating lower house speker akbar tanjung in the third round of a close race .
the bbc jakarta correspondent says mr haz was chosen to balance the more nationalist forces represented by president megawati .
wahid critic when mr haz lost to megawati , he was credited with accepting defeat graciously .
and despite being past rivals , megawati 's party did not put up a vice-presidential candidate against him .
haz defeated akbar tanjung in the final round mr haz was the first minister to quit mr wahid 's first cabinet , resigning as minister for people 's welfare after just two months .
he said he wanted to concentrate on his party , but sources at the palace said mr wahid had accused him of graft , collusion and nepotism .
there was never any investigation and mr haz denied any wrong doing .
he became a vocal critic of mr wahid , but he is also known for his ability to compromise .
mr haz , who is 61 years-old and has 12 children , also served as minister for investment under president bj habibie , who replaced suharto .
but he resigned to lead the ppp in the 1999 elections .
he began his career in the provincial parliament in west kalimantan in 1968 and , after moving to the capital jakarta , became an mp in 1971 - first representing the muslim nahdlatul ulama group and then , from 1973 , the ppp .
before that he had been a newspaper journalist in his home town of pontianak , on the island of borneo , and taught economics at tanjungpura university .
