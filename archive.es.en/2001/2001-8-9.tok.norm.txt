the company made a profit of £ 198m compared with £ 259m profit for the same period of 2000 .
gkn blamed its profit slump on the impact of the us economic slowdown on the company 's auto production activities in north america .
" while there are signs that north american vehicle production levels may be stabilising the picture is less clear in europe , " the company said .
operating profits across its automotive division , which takes a substantial part of its earnings from ford , daimlerchrysler and general motors in the us , fell 25 % .
between 90 and 100 staff will be cut from the head office as part of review which will cost the company £ 23m in the second-half charge .
poor outlook " in comparison to last year , we anticipate vehicle production in both markets to be somewhat lower in the second half , " gkn said .
the group said north american car and light vehicle production in the first half fell 13 % as the economy slowed .
" in aerospace , helicopter sales in the second half should be comparable to those in the first half and in aerospace services we expect a continuing improvement as the restructuring programme nears completion , " the company said .
agustawestland , a 50:50 joint venture with italy 's finmeccanica , is the world 's second-largest helicopter maker .
in may , gkn warned at its annual general meeting that a slowdown in the us automotive sector would eat into its profits .
it had forecast a fall of over 20 % for the first half of the year .
brambles demerger on monday gkn demerged its shares in brambles industries after the transfer of its industrial services operations to the australian-based group was completed .
the demerger had originally been put at £ 17m , but gkn said it now needs to restructure its " central overheads and systems " .
as a result costs will rise to £ 40m .
the results include trade by the support services unit now owned by brambles .

aids in china 23,905 reported hiv / aids cases health ministry says there could be 600,000 cases un says china may have 10 million cases by 2010 for nearly a year , aids activists , along with local and foreign media , have been telling the government about the extent of the aids problem in henan province , where perhaps hundreds of thousands of people have been infected with the hiv virus after selling their blood .
foreign journalists who have visited the area speak of villages filled with despair , where half the population is either dead or dying .
up to now , the government 's response has been containment and denial .
hundreds of thousands were infected with hiv when they sold blood but now for the first time , it has admitted there is a problem .
the communist party says it has sent a team of health officials , including a vice-minister of health , to one of the worst-hit villages in henan .
the party says a special clinic has been set up in the village to give 24-hour care to those suffering from aids-related illnesses .
but the doctor who first brought the crisis to the world 's attention a year ago called the government 's action a " cosmetic gesture " .
she says aids in the affected area is no longer a disease that can be controlled by such measures .
villagers have told how blood was taken from several people at the same time and pooled in one container , where the blood plasma was removed .
the remaining blood was then pumped back into the donors ' bloodstreams .
such unsanitary methods , plus the re-use of needles and unsterilised equipment , gave the disease an easy pathway to spread rapidly through the local population .
journalists report villages filled with despair more than half a million people in central china are believed to have become infected by selling their blood to local government-run blood banks in the mid and late 1990s .
according to official statistics , china had 23,905 reported hiv / aids cases at the end of march this year .
but health ministry experts say the number could be more than 600,000 and the united nations has said china will have 10 million or more hiv / aids sufferers by 2010 unless it acts decisively .
aids activists have had pamphlets confiscated , chinese reporters have been warned off the story and foreign journalists visiting the area have been detained by henan officials , reporters and witnesses say .
the news echoes cases in france , iran , portugal , italy and canada where contaminated blood was used in transfusion , predominantly to haemophiliacs , who then contracted the virus . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's rupert wingfield hayes " the government 's response has been one of containment and denial " the bbc 's adam brookes first reported on china 's aids crisis in may 2001 regional picture africa devastated european hotspots background what is aids ?

only two films made it onto both lists : blazing saddles and airplane !
and only five films from the last decade are included in the critics ' top 100 - of which the highest rated is 1998 's there 's something about mary , which starred cameron diaz .
other recent films approved by the critics were fargo -lrb- 1996 -rrb- , city slickers -lrb- 1991 -rrb- and groundhog day and mrs doubtfire - both from 1993 .

in a striking contrast , half of the american public 's top 10 were from the last 20 years , including dumb and dumber , the jerk , back to the future and raising arizona .
no british-funded films were eligible for inclusion , though the anglo-american production a fish called wanda - starring john cleese , michael palin , kevin kline and jamie lee curtis - made it to number 21 on the critics ' list .
the critics ' list will form the basis for a channel 4 programme , 100 years - 100 laughs , to be shown on saturday .

the festival , one of the premier events in europe , is opening a night early with an extra concert by van morrison .
the appearance by the irish singer was added as an extra fillip to the line-up of the festival which celebrates its 18th anniversary this year .
but there were protestations that the event - which attracts around 50,000 visitors to the market town - was going ahead in view of the culling of thousands of sheep on the beacons over the past few weeks .
powys has had 74 of the 114 cases in wales to date , and tests are currently being carried out to see how far a cull of sheep on the brecon beacons should be extended .
the area has already lost the much-needed income from the royal welsh show at llanelwedd , builth wells , which was cancelled earlier this year because of the impact of the disease .
brecon jazz festival chair jill brody , in her welcome to festival-goers on the official website said : " your presence this year is particularly important to the economy of mid wales in the context of the agricultural crisis .
" we are sure that you will all be sensitive to brecon 's rural environment , and will avoid livestock areas .
earlier in the year the festival had been threatened when two major sponsors withdrew their backing .
a campaign was launched to attract backing from local businesses , but the event was finally secured by a joint sponsorship effort from the wales tourist board -lrb- wtb -rrb- and bbc wales .
the wtb is providing grant aid , while bbc wales has signed a three-year deal for tv and radio coverage of the popular festival .
the bbc said the deal - believed to be worth £ 75,000 - is part of its strengthened commitment to arts broadcasting in wales .
the cost of staging brecon jazz is around £ 330,000 - with around half going towards attracting some of the world 's top jazz names .
as well as van morrison , other highlights of this year 's festival include veteran pianist stan tracey performing his under milkwood suite , south african pianist abdullah ibrahim and grammy-winning american singer dianne reeves .
previous headlining acts have included sonny rollins , courtney pine , dr john , andy sheppard and george melly .
