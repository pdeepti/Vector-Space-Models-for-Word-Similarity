bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- spacecraft flies close to comet categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 23 september , 2001 , 04:43 gmt 05:43 uk spacecraft flies close to comet ds1 was not built to fly-by comets an unmanned experimental spacecraft has flown close to the nucleus of a comet to examine its environment .
i ca n't believe how cool this is dr marc rayman , ds1 mission director the deep space 1 probe passed within 2,000 km -lrb- 1,243 miles -rrb- of comet borrelly .
it is extremely rare for probes to get so close to comets and make detailed measurements .
a spokesman for the american space agency , nasa , said ds1 was performing well and had already sent back pictures of the comet .
ds1 was set to take upwards of 30 black-and-white images of borrelly 's heart - a mountainous ball of ice and dust - during the fly-by .
the first pictures may not be released to the media until monday .
long time " i ca n't believe how cool this is , " said dr marc rayman , the mission director on the ds1 project , as the first data from the probe came through .
" the images started coming down about -lsb- 2245 gmt on saturday -rsb- , but most are still onboard the spacecraft .
still , this is incredibly cool . "
comet borrelly orbits the sun every 6.9 years it will take several days for the probe , which only has a 30-centimetre- -lrb- one-foot- -rrb- diameter antenna , to weakly transmit all the data 220 million kilometers -lrb- 137 million miles -rrb- across space , he said .
" the images are coming along fantastically .
we 're very , very excited .
we had an extremely risky and ambitious goal for the day .
when the images started coming down , we could finally start breathing again after all this time . "
ds1 has also taken measurements of borrelly 's surface , measured and identified the gases it gives off , and studied the interaction of the solar wind with the comet .
this is the process that creates the comet 's distinctive tail .
main mission ds1 was launched in october 1998 , to test a range of new technologies in space .
these included a long-lasting ion propulsion engine , a solar array which focused sunlight for extra power , and software that gave the craft crude artificial intelligence .
ds1 finished its main mission two years ago , and the probe will end its usefulness in november when all its fuel is consumed .
ds1 was not built specifically to encounter comets .
that it has succeeded in gathering close-up information on borrelly is therefore a tremendous fillip to nasa and the project scientists and engineers at the jet propulsion laboratory in california .

i call on all christians and non-christians to love each other , this the main theme of my visit pope john paul ii speaking to thousands of people including many muslims at an open-air mass in the capital astana , the pope spoke of the " logic of love " which could bring together the two faiths .
he also paid tribute to ethnic and religious groups deported to kazakhstan from other parts of the soviet union under stalin .
the visit has taken on a new significance since last week 's attacks on the united states , as kazakhstan borders on several central asian countries which could be caught up in any military action against afghanistan .
over 20,000 attended the mass the pontiff has made no direct reference to the crisis but called for peaceful negotiation to settle conflicts .
" conflicts must be resolved not by force but by peaceful negotiation and dialogue , " he said on arrival on saturday , in an address devoted to kazakhstan 's history as a testing-ground for soviet nuclear weapons .
the pope is due to spend four days in kazakhstan before travelling on to the caucasus , for a visit to armenia .
dark past the pope mentioned the hundreds of thousands of russians , germans , poles , chechens and ukrainians , among them a tiny community of catholics , sent into exile by stalin .
the pope spoke from a tent in traditional kazakh style " i know your history , that suffering which many of you were subjected to when the totalitarian regime tore you away from your native land and deported you here , " he said .
the 300,000-strong catholic population of kazakhstan is tiny compared to the country 's six million russian orthodox christians or the eight million-strong muslim community .
and predictably fewer people turned out for the mass than forecast .
but he still attracted over 20,000 people , the biggest crowd to gather in astana since independence .
no reassurances a vatican spokesman said he had no knowledge of any reassurances from the us that no military action would take place during the pope 's scheduled visit , contrary to earlier reports .
" washington has not given any guarantees on this subject to the holy see which , moreover , has not sought them , " papal spokesman joaquin navarro valls said .
mr nazarbayev thanked the 81-year-old church leader for going ahead with the visit despite the tension over afghanistan .

he also paid tribute to ethnic and religious groups deported to kazakhstan from other parts of the soviet union under stalin .
the visit has taken on a new significance since last week 's attacks on the united states , as kazakhstan borders on several central asian countries which could be caught up in any military action against afghanistan .
the pontiff has made no direct reference to the crisis but called for peaceful negotiation to settle conflicts .
" conflicts must be resolved not by force but by peaceful negotiation and dialogue , " he said on arrival on saturday , in an address devoted to kazakhstan 's history as a testing-ground for soviet nuclear weapons .
the pope is due to spend four days in kazakhstan before travelling on to the caucasus , for a visit to armenia .
dark past the pope mentioned the hundreds of thousands of russians , germans , poles , chechens and ukrainians , among them a tiny community of catholics , sent into exile by stalin .
" i know your history , that suffering which many of you were subjected to when the totalitarian regime tore you away from your native land and deported you here , " he said .
the 300,000-strong catholic population of kazakhstan is tiny compared to the country 's six million russian orthodox christians or the eight million-strong muslim community .
and predictably fewer people turned out for the mass than forecast .
but he still attracted over 20,000 people , the biggest crowd to gather in astana since independence .
no reassurances a vatican spokesman said he had no knowledge of any reassurances from the us that no military action would take place during the pope 's scheduled visit , contrary to earlier reports .
" washington has not given any guarantees on this subject to the holy see which , moreover , has not sought them , " papal spokesman joaquin navarro valls said .
mr nazarbayev thanked the 81-year-old church leader for going ahead with the visit despite the tension over afghanistan .
" today like no other there is a need for dialogue between the muslim and christian world , " the president said .

secretary of state john reid reinstated the northern ireland assembly at midnight on saturday .
the suspension is a legal device which allows a further six weeks in which it is hoped a deadlock between the parties over arms decommissioning can be resolved .
but it has been criticised by both sinn fein and ulster unionist leader david trimble .
speaking on the bbc 's breakfast with frost programme on sunday , dr reid said the breathing space created by the move must not be squandered .
he said the impetus was on the republican movement to move on the arms issue .
" what we need to break the impasse , and hopefully it will come soon , is for the ira to take that step they said they were prepared to do , " he said .
" if they do , i believe we can get a new dynamic .
if they do n't then i think we have a very serious problem . "
the suspension came a few hours after mr trimble said he and his ministers would quit the assembly if the ira does not begin to disarm .
he told the bbc he plans to table a motion in the assembly on monday to expel sinn fein from government if the ira does not start decommissioning .
if the motion fails to gain cross-party support mr trimble said he and his ministers in the power-sharing executive would leave office .
it is expected to be up to three weeks before the motion is debated .
sinn fein 's alex maskey said mr trimble 's latest move showed he did not want to work with republicans .
" it is further evidence that david trimble wants out of the institutions , rather than trying to work with the other parties to build stability and trust and to solve the problems collectively , " he said .
sinn fein also attacked the suspension , saying britain was fixated with ira disarmament even though it called a ceasefire four years ago .
dup assembly member ian paisley junior said mr trimble 's decision was " long overdue " .
he added : " on two occasions we have put forward such motions and he has refused to co-operate .
now , as an election looms nearer , trimble has at last changed his stance on exclusion motion . "
' running out of road ' earlier , dr reid defended his decision to suspend the assembly - the second time in six weeks he has used the device .
but he made it clear he did not intend to use this tactic again .
" people in northern ireland are tired of the endless wrangling , they 're tired of attempting to get this issue of arms resolved and they want the remaining issues resolved , " he said .
" so there 's a sense in which we 're running out of road here . "
arms decommissioning remains the major sticking point between the parties , although police reforms , british army demilitarisation and the stability of the institutions are also areas of discussion .
mr trimble caused the latest crisis by resigning as northern ireland first minister on 1 july , over the arms issue .
under the legislation in place , six weeks after his resignation there would have to be an unlimited suspension of the assembly , or fresh elections .
both these options have been rejected in the past , on the basis that they would cause even more damage to the political process .

the glasgow-born funnyman said he felt his father william , who died in the early 1980s , had been " disloyal " by subjecting him to sexual abuse from the age of ten .
the revelation comes in a biography written by his wife , pamela stephenson - a fellow comedian who later became a trained psychologist .
connolly , 59 , said his dark secret had been a huge burden , even in his adult life .
i remember it happening a lot , not every night , but every night you were in a state thinking it was going to happen , you 'd be awakened by it .
he said : " i have no lack of love for my father .
i love his memory now , as much as i loved him when he was alive .
" it was disloyal of him to do that to me .
but there were other facets of his character that were great .
" but still , i kept thinking , if i 'm still troubled by this , if i 'm still carrying it around like a big rucksack full of bricks and my father 's dead , i need someone to tell me how to get rid of this great weight . "
connolly said he was abused for five years from the age of ten , part of a disruptive childhood which saw his mother leave home when he was three years old , leaving him and his sister florence in the care of their two aunts .
he added : " the most awful thing was that it was kind of pleasant physically , you know .
that 's why nobody tells .
brass eye " i remember it happening a lot , not every night , but every night you were in a state thinking it was going to happen , you 'd be awakened by it .
" i would pray for the holidays .
i could n't wait for us to go to the seaside because then we had separate beds . "
last month connolly hinted at his past as he defended the controversial brass eye spoof documentary on paedophilia , which sparked uproar when it was broadcast in july .
he said : " i did n't see it , but it 's a field that should be explored .
i think there 's no boundary at all , whether it 's that subject or another . "
channel 4 has since been ordered to broadcast an apology after the independent television commission ruled the programme had breached its code by not giving sufficient warnings about the programme and failing to consider the expectations of viewers .

mr trimble told the bbc he plans to table a motion in the northern ireland assembly on monday , but it could be up to three weeks before it is debated .
if the motion fails to gain cross-community support mr trimble said he and his ministers in the power-sharing executive will leave office .
secretary of state john reid is expected to re-instate devolution in the province at midnight on saturday after it was suspended for 24 hours .
the move created another six weeks for the parties to try to reach agreement over the issues of ira decommissioning , british army demilitarisation and ensuring the stability of the institutions .
' ira not expected to move ' but speaking on the bbc 's inside politics programme on saturday , mr trimble said he would table a motion to exclude sinn fein from government and " bring matters to a head " .
he said he was no longer prepared to continue power-sharing with sinn fein , while the ira had not started to decommission .
" the secretary of state and the chief constable have said there is no indication from their security sources that a start to ira decommissioning is imminent , " he said .
" we are simply buying more time to avoid facing up to problems - the refusal of the republican movement and the other paramilitary organisations to disarm . "
dup motions failed two attempts by the anti-agreement democratic unionist party to exclude sinn fein have been defeated in the past because they did not attract cross-party support .
however , mr trimble said he was hopeful his motion would gain the support of nationalist sdlp members .
the ulster unionist leader said it would be " hypocritical " of his party 's ministers to remain in office if their exclusion motion failed and they would then leave the executive .
asked what could stop this course of action , mr trimble said : " the -lsb- ira -rsb- must begin a process of credible decommissioning .
not just a one-off , but a credible process . "
he added that letting the process continue as it had done since his resignation as northern ireland first minister on 1 july would be " harmful " .
mr trimble announced his decision after spending saturday morning consulting party colleagues .
the ulster unionist leader had called on dr reid to call an unlimited suspension during which the failure in the political process as a whole could have been examined , rather than calling another 24-hour suspension .
speaking on the same programme , dr reid defended his decision to suspend the assembly for another short period .
but he made it clear he did not intend to use this tactic again .
" people in northern ireland are tired of the endless wrangling , they 're tired of attempting to get this issue of arms resolved and they want the remaining issues resolved .
so there 's a sense in which we 're running out of road here , " he said .
sinn fein 's alex maskey said mr trimble 's latest move showed he did not want to work with republicans .
" it is further evidence that david trimble wants out of the institutions , rather than trying to work with the other parties to build stability and trust and to solve the problems collectively , " he said .
meanwhile , dup assembly member ian paisley junior said david trimble 's decision to " adopt dup policy and move now to exclude sinn fein from government is long overdue " .
he added : " on two occasions we have put forward such motions and he has refused to co-operate .
now , as an election looms nearer , trimble has at last changed his stance on exclusion motion . "

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- college fun fit for a prince categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 23 september , 2001 , 11:28 gmt 12:28 uk college fun fit for a prince it will not all be hard work for the student prince prince william might well be heir to the throne , but such regal standing will not help him escape the hard sell of that now quintessential part of student life - the university society .
it will come as a disappointment to many of the university 's clubs and societies to learn that the prince has made a policy decision not to join any of them , at least to begin with .
societies for drama , environmental campaigning and debating would doubtless regard his membership as a coup , as would surely the infamous kate kennedy club , a male-only group founded in 1926 which organises balls and refuses to involve women .
if william fears clubs would exploit him to promote themselves , or whether he is merely being cautious not to trespass inadvertently into political activism , he does not say .
the prince will study history of art but it is clear he is determined to steer a path of least resistance through his opening weeks .
" i 'm going to keep my options open until i 'm settled , " he said .
he does , however , " very much doubt " he 'll be joining the kate kennedy club .
st andrews university boasts more than 100 affiliated bodies , ranging from the genteel bridge club to the not-so-genteel fencing club .
art-loving teenager but what will win over this very special fresher ?
societies in poll position for signing up the sports-mad , art-loving teenager include the water polo club , the mountaineering club and the st andrews musical society .
as a fairly new addition to the university , the water polo club says it is " keen to welcome new members " - both beginners and more experienced .
so , if the prince finds himself at a loose end on a thursday evening he can join fellow water sports fanatics in the pool of st leonard 's school .
outdoors type and the young prince might be up for joining the mountaineering club .
after all , he is already familiar with scotland 's outdoors - given all of those midge-filled summers at balmoral with his father , brother and grandmother .
to hone his public speaking skills for his future life as king , william would do well to join the university 's debating society .
it boasts being the oldest and finest " bastion of free speech " .
however , the prince might surprise everyone and go for something completely off the wall like the james bond appreciation society .
the prince could join the tunnock 's club it is not known whether william is a 007 fan , but he might get hooked , after all he will be living in the home country of one bond great , sean connery .
if that is a non-starter , there is always st andrews university tunnock 's caramel wafer appreciation society or the tennents lager appreciation society -lrb- yes , they really do exist -rrb- .
you never know , if the prince really gets into society life the " wills for president " campaign could be just around the corner .
of course william could opt to create his own society , with the help of the st andrews university website 's set-by-step " idiots guide " .
essential requirements include coming up with original aims for the new organisation ; finding 20 like-minded people who will join and pay a subscription of at least Â£ 1 ; forming a committee and holding an annual meeting .

it will come as a disappointment to many of the university 's clubs and societies to learn that the prince has made a policy decision not to join any of them , at least to begin with .
societies for drama , environmental campaigning and debating would doubtless regard his membership as a coup , as would surely the infamous kate kennedy club , a male-only group founded in 1926 which organises balls and refuses to involve women .
if william fears clubs would exploit him to promote themselves , or whether he is merely being cautious not to trespass inadvertently into political activism , he does not say .
but it is clear he is determined to steer a path of least resistance through his opening weeks .
" i 'm going to keep my options open until i 'm settled , " he said .
he does , however , " very much doubt " he 'll be joining the kate kennedy club .
st andrews university boasts more than 100 affiliated bodies , ranging from the genteel bridge club to the not-so-genteel fencing club .
art-loving teenager but what will win over this very special fresher ?
societies in poll position for signing up the sports-mad , art-loving teenager include the water polo club , the mountaineering club and the st andrews musical society .
as a fairly new addition to the university , the water polo club says it is " keen to welcome new members " - both beginners and more experienced .
so , if the prince finds himself at a loose end on a thursday evening he can join fellow water sports fanatics in the pool of st leonard 's school .
outdoors type and the young prince might be up for joining the mountaineering club .
after all , he is already familiar with scotland 's outdoors - given all of those midge-filled summers at balmoral with his father , brother and grandmother .
to hone his public speaking skills for his future life as king , william would do well to join the university 's debating society .
it boasts being the oldest and finest " bastion of free speech " .
however , the prince might surprise everyone and go for something completely off the wall like the james bond appreciation society .
it is not known whether william is a 007 fan , but he might get hooked , after all he will be living in the home country of one bond great , sean connery .
if that is a non-starter , there is always st andrews university tunnock 's caramel wafer appreciation society or the tennents lager appreciation society -lrb- yes , they really do exist -rrb- .
you never know , if the prince really gets into society life the " wills for president " campaign could be just around the corner .
of course william could opt to create his own society , with the help of the st andrews university website 's set-by-step " idiots guide " .
essential requirements include coming up with original aims for the new organisation ; finding 20 like-minded people who will join and pay a subscription of at least Â£ 1 ; forming a committee and holding an annual meeting .
if he did decide to join a society william would be prize-property - a real asset in helping to swell membership and attracting plenty of publicity .

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- student prince hints at welsh visits categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 23 september , 2001 , 12:05 gmt 13:05 uk student prince hints at welsh visits william starts at university in scotland on monday prince william has dropped his biggest hint that he will be playing a role in welsh life .
on the eve of his first day at st andrews university in scotland , the 19-year-old said he did not want to pick an english college because he wanted a new environment .
william will succeed his father as prince of wales " i have lived there and wanted to get away and try somewhere else , " he said .
" i also knew i would be seeing a lot of wales in the future . "
william started to learn welsh at eton in 1999 in anticipation of succeeding his father as prince of wales .
his latest interview , as he prepares to begin a degree in the history of art in the fife town , is a strong indication he aims to take his duties in wales seriously .
welsh lessons prince charles was invested to the post in the summer of 1969 during a ceremony at caernarfon castle after a crash course in the welsh language at the university of wales , aberystwyth .
he showed he still had a command of the language when he made a speech at the opening of the welsh assembly in cardiff in may 1999 .
the prince of wales said he was anxious for his eldest son to be become fluent in the language in time for his investiture to the post , and had william take extra lessons from ffion hague 's sister , manon williams .
i wanted to get away and try somewhere else - i knew i would be seeing a lot of wales in the future prince william charles has been a frequent visitor throughout his role and is priming william for subsequent visits , after his father becomes the king .
the teenager has recently completed a gap year in which he undertook various projects in chile and africa before concentrating on his course , along with st andrews 's 6,500 other students .
" having more independence is quite a big thing , although i 've always got policemen around so i 'm never completely independent , " he said .
' ordinary student ' " but i 'm particularly looking forward to being able to manage my own time in a relaxed atmosphere .
i want to go there and be an ordinary student .
" i mean , i 'm only going to university .
it 's not like i 'm getting married - though that 's what it feels like sometimes . "
applications to close-knit st andrews from the uk have shot up by 44 % and international applicants have rocketed by 100 % in anticipation of the prince 's arrival .
but william said he could see through attempts by other teenagers to simply catch a glimpse of him .
" it will get easier as time goes on , " he added .
" everyone will get bored of me - which they do .
