ec scientists say overfishing in the north sea is now so severe that just three out of 10 cod reach maturity .
brussels says a long-term plan to scale back fishing fleets is the only effective response to the crisis - but admits this will lead to job losses .
earlier this year , a large swathe of the north sea was closed to protect cod spawning grounds - the first time such a drastic measure was taken .
this week , the commission is expected to announce similar emergency closures of hake fishing grounds .
some of the worst-affected areas are in the north sea and the irish sea .
recovery period fisheries commissioner , franz fischler , says long-term cuts in catches are needed to allow fish stocks to recover .
last december , eu ministers reluctantly agreed a 45 % reduction in cod and hake quotas for the current year .
environmental groups warned that was insufficient , and now the commission says the cuts should be extended indefinitely .
as a result , it warns , some fishing businesses will go bust , leading to significant job losses .
eu funds to help fishing communities are available , but officials say countries like britain have failed to use all the money because under ec rules they must contribute too .
the commission hopes its conservation plan - which must be agreed by ministers - can be introduced by the middle of next year at the latest .

american and palestinian officials announced the breakthrough following a meeting between palestinian leader yasser arafat and cia director george tenet in the west bank city of ramallah .
the us plan aims stabilise the current ceasefire , which is under increasing pressure , and then to create measures to restore confidence between the palestinians and israelis , and eventually lead to a resumption of formal peace negotiations .
the precise terms under which the palestinians accepted the us plan are unclear .
is it the role of mr arafat to be the policeman , to protect the israeli government in tel aviv or haifa ?
it is nonsense actually hamas spokesman the main sticking points for the palestinians were mr tenet 's call for the detention of members of militant organisations such as hamas and islamic jihad and the creation of buffer zones between israeli and palestinian forces .
according to reports , palestinian officials agreed to arrest militants , but were not happy to establish buffer zones in the occupied territories to keep the two sides apart .
israel had earlier accepted the proposals , drawn up by mr tenet to cement a ceasefire and end eight months of violence that have seen the deaths of about 600 people .
immediate implementation a us state department official said israel and the palestinians had agreed on a " work plan " to end violence and return to the status quo before the palestinian intifada -lrb- uprising -rrb- broke out last september .
" steps will be taken immediately to implement the work plan , " said the official .
he added that mr tenet , who had originally intended to return to washington on tuesday , would remain in the region until at least wednesday for possible further talks .
the bbc correspondent in jerusalem says that although both sides have accepted the us plan , each has serious reservations .
arafat 's difficulty mr arafat in particular will have serious difficulties selling the deal to his people .
hamas and islamic jihad are very popular amongst palestinians in the west bank and gaza .
any move against these groups by mr arafat 's forces might undermine his position completely .
muhammad zahar , a spokesman for hamas told the bbc : " is it the role of mr arafat to be the policeman , to protect the israeli government in tel aviv or haifa ?
it is nonsense actually . "
a spokesman for mr arafat , marwan kanafani , explained the political difficulty in arresting hamas and islamic jihad members .
mr kanafani told the bbc : " if there was an agreement or a promise that there will be an end to this israeli occupation and aggression , the palestinian authority could start talking to the people about laying down their arms .
but as it stands now there is no way that we can punish the people that defended their country . "
mr kanafani repeated the palestinian call that the ceasefire be based on proposals by an international committee led by former us senator george mitchell .
the mitchell report called for an end to violence followed by a cooling-off period and confidence-building moves , including a freeze on jewish settlement building in the west bank and gaza .
moving forward israeli prime minister ariel sharon , making a speech to business people on tuesday evening , said : " i decided to accept the programme laid out by mr tenet and see if it will lead to a reduction in hostilities .
" i ca n't say i am enthusiastic about the plan , but on the whole we can work and move forward . "
the announcement of the agreement came a few hours after the israeli army said a greek orthodox monk had been killed by palestinian gunfire in the west bank on a road leading to the jewish settlement of maale adumim .
the man , an israeli national , is said to have been driving his car when firing came from another car on the road .
the us-led peace drive has attracted international support .
united nations secretary-general kofi annan is due to visit the region along with javier solana , the european union 's foreign policy chief .

lucent technologies bonds have been reduced to junk status after standard & poor 's revised down its rating of the firm , which lost $ 3.7bn in its second quarter .
the downgrade " reflects significant uncertainties about the company 's ability to continue to improve its operating profitability ... in light of challenging sector market conditions , " s & p said .
the revision , announced late on tuesday , came hours after internet holding company cmgi , which owns the altavista search engine , revealed that its third quarter losses had more than doubled .
and the announcements come in a period of renewed gloom over tech stocks , with computer hardware firm hewlett-packard last week warning that the sector 's slowdown was spreading worldwide .
on friday chipmaker intel repeated warnings of falling sales , and on tuesday nokia stunned the markets by issuing a surprise profits warning .
investments downgraded cmgi , which has seen its stock plummet 93 % in the last year , blamed an operating loss of almost $ 996m largely on a decision to revise down the value of investments made last year in internet firms tallan , adforce and activate .
adforce , a digital marketing firm , has exhausted its resources and is winding down operations .
but cmgi revenues rose to $ 301m during the quarter , compared with $ 233.1m in the same period a year before , tuesday 's statement showed .
cmgi , which under current conditions has sufficient cash to sustain operations for three years , expects to trim annual losses to £ 150m next year , chairman david wetherell said .
troubled times the downgrade of lucent bonds come amid a troubled period for the firm , which last week announced early retirement packages for 10,000 staff .
the telecoms firm 's efforts to bolster performance by merging with alcatel were abandoned two weeks ago , prompting the announcement of 900 job cuts in the us .
standard & poor 's estimated that , despite the shake-up , lucent will not return to operating profit until the first half of its next fiscal year .
lucent said it was not surprised by the agency 's decision .
but lucent chiefs " do n't expect it to have a significant impact on our business " , a company spokeswoman said .
" we are executing on all points of our business restructuring program , and as we have said we are picking up the pace . "
s & p 's announcement , made after the close of stock markets on tuesday , is seen as likely to prompt further falls in lucent shares , which have slid 41 % this year .
the downgrade is also likely to make it harder for lucent to raise the $ 2bn needed to finish spinning-off its agere optical components division .

lucent technologies bonds have been reduced to junk status after standard & poor 's revised down its rating of the firm , which lost $ 3.7bn in its second quarter .
the downgrade " reflects significant uncertainties about the company 's ability to continue to improve its operating profitability ... in light of challenging sector market conditions , " s & p said .
the revision , announced late on tuesday , came hours after internet holding company cmgi , which owns the altavista search engine , revealed that its third quarter losses had more than doubled .
and the announcements come in a period of renewed gloom over tech stocks , with computer hardware firm hewlett-packard last week warning that the sector 's slowdown was spreading worldwide .
on friday chipmaker intel repeated warnings of falling sales , and on tuesday nokia stunned the markets by issuing a surprise profits warning .
investments downgraded cmgi , which has seen its stock plummet 93 % in the last year , blamed an operating loss of almost $ 996m largely on a decision to revise down the value of investments made last year in internet firms tallan , adforce and activate .
adforce , a digital marketing firm , has exhausted its resources and is winding down operations .
but cmgi revenues rose to $ 301m during the quarter , compared with $ 233.1m in the same period a year before , tuesday 's statement showed .
cmgi , which under current conditions has sufficient cash to sustain operations for three years , expects to trim annual losses to £ 150m next year , chairman david wetherell said .
troubled times the downgrade of lucent bonds come amid a troubled period for the firm , which last week announced early retirement packages for 10,000 staff .
the telecoms firm 's efforts to bolster performance by merging with alcatel were abandoned two weeks ago , prompting the announcement of 900 job cuts in the us .
standard & poor 's estimated that , despite the shake-up , lucent will not return to operating profit until the first half of its next fiscal year .
lucent said it was not surprised by the agency 's decision .
but lucent chiefs " do n't expect it to have a significant impact on our business " , a company spokeswoman said .
" we are executing on all points of our business restructuring program , and as we have said we are picking up the pace . "
s & p 's announcement , made after the close of stock markets on tuesday , is seen as likely to prompt further falls in lucent shares , which have slid 41 % this year .
the downgrade is also likely to make it harder for lucent to raise the $ 2bn needed to finish spinning-off its agere optical components division .

the quarterly report to the welsh assembly 's economic development committee warns that the outlook for the region is " not particularly optimistic " .
assembly members are expected to be told that even the most positive of predictions still fall short of expected growth in the rest of the uk .
the february 2001 regional economic forecast for wales from cambridge econometrics predicts growth for 2001 at 2.4 % - compared with 3.0 % for the uk .
together with slower growth in services , they forecast overall growth of 1.7 % for wales in 2002 .
but the welsh economy research unit at cardiff university offers a more pessimistic picture , forecasting real gdp growth of 1.3 % in wales in 2001 , rising to 1.5 % in 2002 .
last autumn , the national assembly played down a report predicting 3.2 % growth in the welsh economy during 2001 .
' relegation zone ' the study by oxford economic forecasting estimated that economic gains in wales would " leave behind " areas of england and scotland .
at the time , the assembly repeated first minister rhodri morgan 's fears for manufacturing industry in wales in the face of a weak euro .
mr morgan - wales 's former economic development secretary - had earlier said that he believed wales was in the " relegation zone " of the british economic league .
his words were a prophecy foretold , with the loss of 3,000 corus jobs and many thousands more in traditional industries being shed in the past 12 months .
sony and panasonic have shed hundreds of jobs , while the assembly has stepped in to avert redundancies at several other leading companies in wales .
