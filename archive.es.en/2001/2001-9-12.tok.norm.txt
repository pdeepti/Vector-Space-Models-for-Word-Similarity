on wednesday , asia 's major airports and airlines were disrupted as airport authorities in japan , hong kong , singapore , china , taiwan and south korea grounded flights .
tokyo 's narita international airport said on wednesday that 170 flights would be cancelled , while hong kong international airport said 14 flights had been halted .
hong kong-based cathay pacific , asia 's fourth-biggest airline , has suspended all flights to the united states and canada .
commercial losses america 's 15,000 airports will remain closed until at least noon -lrb- 1600 gmt -rrb- on wednesday following the attacks on the pentagon and the world trade center using four hijacked passenger jets .
us flights make up 25 % of business for some major asian airlines , according to salomon smith barney airline analyst tiffany co .
" i would assume there is going to be disruption everywhere " , she said .
japan airlines has cancelled 32 flights and all nippon airlines eight .
almost immediately following the attacks , federal authorities cleared us airspace of the 4,000 aircraft typically in the sky on a weekday morning , ordering planes in flight to land at the nearest airport .
and even once airports do reopen , stringent security of a kind unfamiliar to most us domestic air travellers but well-known to fliers elsewhere is now likely to be a fixture .
it will be " slow going " getting the nation 's air system back into action , said federal aviation authority spokeswoman diane spitaliere .
" this is unprecedented , " she said .
diverted flights en route to the us on tuesday were ordered to fly elsewhere , with many being diverted to canada , where air canada suspended all its flights .
canada 's government later closed canadian airports - now full to bursting with stranded passengers - to all aircraft except incoming flights already diverted from the us and " those flights required for humanitarian purposes " .
" transport canada is on highest alert , " said transportation minister david collenette .
" we will continue to monitor the situation and take whatever action is necessary . "
ba and lufthansa cancel united airways , the us airline which lost two flights on tuesday , said it had grounded all its flights worldwide , as did american airlines , which also lost two flights .
among european carriers , british airways cancelled all flights to and from the us for the rest of tuesday , with some america-bound aeroplanes turned around mid-flight .

air france cancelled seven flights and ordered another seven to return .
sabena and finnair called back their flights while scandinavian airlines system ordered four us bound flights to instead land in iceland .
poland 's lot airlines cancelled its flights to the us and canada and ordered two planes en route to turn back .
and almost half the 354 international flights scheduled to leave tokyo 's narita airport on wednesday have now been cancelled .
congestion european airports quickly clogged up as flights were cancelled and diverted and security operations stepped up , while other staff tried to comfort distressed passengers .
airline industry shares slip : british airways : down 21.21 % easyjet : down 11.46 % baa : down 16.42 % baa , the owner of seven uk airports including heathrow , gatwick and stansted serving london , has suspended flights to the us .
in america , congestion will be a serious problem as well .
under normal circumstances a large proportion of its planes would be in the air at any point in time .
space at airports is scarce , so landing planes within a narrow timeframe presents huge logistical difficulties .
airline shares fall as is often the case , traders in the financial markets were the first to react , trading on the bad news .
in london , shares in airlines and other travel industry firms fell sharply , with british airways , baa , ryanair , and easyjet all losing ground .
ba shares dropped 21 % , while lufthansa and air france lost 17 % and 16 % respectively .

on wednesday , asia 's major airports and airlines were disrupted as airport authorities in japan , hong kong , singapore , china , taiwan and south korea grounded flights .
tokyo 's narita international airport said on wednesday that 170 flights would be cancelled , while hong kong international airport said 14 flights had been halted .
hong kong-based cathay pacific , asia 's fourth-biggest airline , has suspended all flights to the united states and canada .

us flights make up 25 % of business for some major asian airlines , according to salomon smith barney airline analyst tiffany co .
" i would assume there is going to be disruption everywhere " , she said .
japan airlines has cancelled 32 flights and all nippon airlines eight .
almost immediately following the attacks , federal authorities cleared us airspace of the 4,000 aircraft typically in the sky on a weekday morning , ordering planes in flight to land at the nearest airport .
and even once airports do reopen , stringent security of a kind unfamiliar to most us domestic air travellers but well-known to fliers elsewhere is now likely to be a fixture .
it will be " slow going " getting the nation 's air system back into action , said federal aviation authority spokeswoman diane spitaliere .
" this is unprecedented , " she said .
diverted flights en route to the us on tuesday were ordered to fly elsewhere , with many being diverted to canada , where air canada suspended all its flights .
canada 's government later closed canadian airports - now full to bursting with stranded passengers - to all aircraft except incoming flights already diverted from the us and " those flights required for humanitarian purposes " .
" transport canada is on highest alert , " said transportation minister david collenette .
" we will continue to monitor the situation and take whatever action is necessary . "

among european carriers , british airways cancelled all flights to and from the us for the rest of tuesday , with some america-bound aeroplanes turned around mid-flight .

all lufthansa flights from germany were cancelled , while iberia ordered its four planes en-route to the us to fly to canada or return to spain .
air france cancelled seven flights and ordered another seven to return .
sabena and finnair called back their flights while scandinavian airlines system ordered four us bound flights to instead land in iceland .
poland 's lot airlines cancelled its flights to the us and canada and ordered two planes en route to turn back .
and almost half the 354 international flights scheduled to leave tokyo 's narita airport on wednesday have now been cancelled .
congestion european airports quickly clogged up as flights were cancelled and diverted and security operations stepped up , while other staff tried to comfort distressed passengers .
airline industry shares slip : british airways : down 21.21 % easyjet : down 11.46 % baa : down 16.42 % baa , the owner of seven uk airports including heathrow , gatwick and stansted serving london , has suspended flights to the us .
in america , congestion will be a serious problem as well .
under normal circumstances a large proportion of its planes would be in the air at any point in time .
space at airports is scarce , so landing planes within a narrow timeframe presents huge logistical difficulties .
airline shares fall as is often the case , traders in the financial markets were the first to react , trading on the bad news .
in london , shares in airlines and other travel industry firms fell sharply , with british airways , baa , ryanair , and easyjet all losing ground .
ba shares dropped 21 % , while lufthansa and air france lost 17 % and 16 % respectively .
on wall street , where shares in american airlines and travel firms would normally be traded , dealing was suspended following the attacks .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- doctors ' fuelling antibiotic resistance ' categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 12 september , 2001 , 07:13 gmt 08:13 uk doctors ' fuelling antibiotic resistance ' some antibiotics have lost their ability to treat disease us doctors are prescribing antibiotics freely to people with sore throats - even though for most the treatment is completely inappropriate .
the research was published on the same day that the world health organization issued a warning that humans are building up dangerous levels of resistance to modern antibiotics that could leave them vulnerable to killer diseases .
the world health body said tuberculosis strains in several countries had become resistant to two of the most effective drugs and some antimalarial medicines had become practically useless as parasites adapted their defences .
unless we act to protect these medical miracles , we could be heading for a post-antibiotic age gro harlem brundtland who director gro harlem brundtland said : " antibiotics were one of the most significant discoveries of the 20th century .
" unless we act to protect these medical miracles , we could be heading for a post-antibiotic age in which many medical and surgical advances could be undermined by the risk of incurable infection . "
study findings results from the us national ambulatory medical care survey , conducted between 1989 and 1999 , showed that 73 % of patients with sore throats received antibiotic prescriptions .
however , antibiotics are only helpful in about 10 % of cases where sore throats are caused by bacterial " strep " infection .
most sore throats are due to viruses , against which antibiotics have no effect .
lead researcher dr jeffrey linder , from massachusetts general hospital , said : " if you go and see your doctor for an upper respiratory infection , including a sore throat , nine times out of 10 you should not be given an antibiotic . "
the researchers said part of the problem was that doctors were pressurised into prescribing antibiotics by expectant patients .
they warned that as well as helping develop drug resistance , excessive antibiotic use could place patients at risk of allergic reactions .
newer drugs many of the prescriptions were for newer , " broad-spectrum " drugs which cost as much as 20 to 40 times more than the two antibiotics recommended for strep throat , penicillin and erythromycin .
researcher dr randall stafford said : " patients who previously received antibiotics for viral conditions , probably received no benefit from those prescriptions .
" on their next episode of sore throat , they may feel they need a newer antibiotic because of their unsatisfying earlier experience . "
the researchers said a small decline in the number of prescriptions was seen in 1999 , which may indicate that doctors and patients were becoming more aware of the dangers of overusing antibiotics .
the research was published in the journal of the american medical association .

she said the us made greater use of the abortion pill , used for pregnancies of up to nine weeks , meaning women spent less time in hospital .
she said methods such as this would need to be more commonly used in the uk to ensure speedier abortions .
" we have to break the mould of the way abortions are carried out here .

she said more and more women were demanding a speedier service and were reluctant to spend longer in hospital than necessary .

but professor david grimes , of the university of north carolina , warned that offering earlier abortions would not rule out the need for later abortions .
he said that although the us offered abortions within a week of a woman asking for one , there was still a large number of requests for second trimester abortions .
in the us up to 10 % of all abortions are carried out between 12 and 22 weeks , mainly for disadvantaged women .
but he said it was vital women wanting an abortion were offered them as soon as possible .
" delays are themselves unethical . "
time to reflect jack scarisbrick , national chairman of the charity life , said his organisation was diametrically opposed to any plans to cut the time it took for a woman to have an abortion .
he said women needed time to think and reflect on what they were doing and that rushing them through on an abortion " conveyor belt " would not give them this time .
" what women want is the chance to calm down they need to have more space .
we want the abortion industry to wither away because that is what is best for women . "

the research was published on the same day that the world health organization issued a warning that humans are building up dangerous levels of resistance to modern antibiotics that could leave them vulnerable to killer diseases .
the world health body said tuberculosis strains in several countries had become resistant to two of the most effective drugs and some antimalarial medicines had become practically useless as parasites adapted their defences .
unless we act to protect these medical miracles , we could be heading for a post-antibiotic age gro harlem brundtland who director gro harlem brundtland said : " antibiotics were one of the most significant discoveries of the 20th century .
" unless we act to protect these medical miracles , we could be heading for a post-antibiotic age in which many medical and surgical advances could be undermined by the risk of incurable infection . "
study findings results from the us national ambulatory medical care survey , conducted between 1989 and 1999 , showed that 73 % of patients with sore throats received antibiotic prescriptions .
however , antibiotics are only helpful in about 10 % of cases where sore throats are caused by bacterial " strep " infection .
most sore throats are due to viruses , against which antibiotics have no effect .
lead researcher dr jeffrey linder , from massachusetts general hospital , said : " if you go and see your doctor for an upper respiratory infection , including a sore throat , nine times out of 10 you should not be given an antibiotic . "
the researchers said part of the problem was that doctors were pressurised into prescribing antibiotics by expectant patients .
they warned that as well as helping develop drug resistance , excessive antibiotic use could place patients at risk of allergic reactions .
newer drugs many of the prescriptions were for newer , " broad-spectrum " drugs which cost as much as 20 to 40 times more than the two antibiotics recommended for strep throat , penicillin and erythromycin .
researcher dr randall stafford said : " patients who previously received antibiotics for viral conditions , probably received no benefit from those prescriptions .
" on their next episode of sore throat , they may feel they need a newer antibiotic because of their unsatisfying earlier experience . "
the researchers said a small decline in the number of prescriptions was seen in 1999 , which may indicate that doctors and patients were becoming more aware of the dangers of overusing antibiotics .
the research was published in the journal of the american medical association .

i was on the ground floor of one of the towers at about nine o 'clock in the morning when the building literally shuddered .
because you ca n't begin to imagine that a hi-jacked aircraft has been deliberately crashed into a complex of buildings in which 50,000 people work , your mind immediately looks for other , reasonable explanations .
" an earthquake " went through my mind in an instant before being discounted .
the second aircraft emerged in the bluest of skies and simply tore straight into the second tower then i thought it must have been a huge accident on a construction site , something like a giant weight dropping from a very great height .
at which point , people streamed through the lobby and smoke enveloped the whole area .
people were n't panicking , simply moving swiftly and determinedly for open space .
people , including myself , could n't imagine that further danger existed .
flames and smoke you ca n't imagine the reality of it all - so we stayed put , simply looking up at the first tower that was struck .
flames and smoke were appearing from the top .
as people looked , the second aircraft emerged in the bluest of skies and simply tore straight into the second tower .
people then fled further - but still not far enough .

there were long lines of ambulances stretched up to the site of the world trade center .
