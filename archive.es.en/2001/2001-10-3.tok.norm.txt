planes belonging to both carriers were hijacked for the attacks on america on 11 september .
united spokesman joe hopkins said that steel bars should be on the doors in a matter of weeks .
although locks on cockpit doors are already standard practice in the us - although not in the uk and europe - without reinforcements it would be relatively easy to force the locks .
bush recommendation us president george w bush has recommended the move .
american - the largest us airline - said prototypes had already been installed on two planes and would be placed in all the aircraft operated by american and its subsidiary , trans world airlines -lrb- twa -rrb- within 30 days .
united also said it had placed 30in -lrb- 75cm -rrb- prototype metal bars in two of its aircraft .
other airlines are also investigating the measures .
alaska airlines , the nation 's ninth-largest carrier , said on monday it would install crossbar locking devices on its 103-strong fleet .
interim step american said the devices were aimed at immediately securing the cockpits while the federal aviation administration looks into " ways to further enhance security " .
but although the devices are aimed at improving airline safety , airline industry observers are concerned that they could create new problems .
they say the bars could prevent emergency evacuation of the cockpit , and could prevent flight attendants from getting into the cockpit if pilots fell ill .
but airline officials stressed that the steel bars were only an interim solution and long-term measures could address these concerns .
