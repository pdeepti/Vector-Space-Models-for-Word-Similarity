as 6,800 multimedia experts from 75 countries gather in los angeles for the annual siggraph convention , it is becoming clear virtual reality is becoming chillingly real .
imagine being able to smell the disgusting breath of dinosaurs in a future version of jurassic park and feel the ground shake as they approach .
this does not seem so far fetched given new research being presented at the international conference .
seeing is n't quite believing the look of vr is getting slicker every day .
joystick trips are possible through virtual landscapes and they are impressive .
siggraph facts anticipated total attendance : 40,000 anticipated international attendance : 6,800 from 75 countries anticipated exhibitors : 300 companies what are lacking are the smells and sensations of the real world .
but so-called haptic , or touch technologies being developed at the university of tokyo by takuya nojima hint at what is to come .
mr nojima 's research allows something as delicate as the boundary between two liquids - oil and water , perhaps - to be touched .
his ambitions for the technology may be lofty but it is easy to speculate on more mundane future applications for this , too .
a vr cookery course , for instance , where haptics and a dash of smell science help demonstrate the feel of a ripe mango , or how a charentais melon should smell when it is good to eat .
how shall we play today ?
from its origins in 1969 as the association for computing machinery 's special interest group on computer graphics and interactive techniques , siggraph has grown out of all recognition .
the evolution of computer graphics can best be understood as part of the ... evolution of human intelligence and its relationship to the natural world danny hillis , applied minds for the past 27 years , the world 's leading video games manufacturers have joined animators , artists and video directors to show off their best at siggraph .
this year their impact will be felt even more keenly among cinemagoers , as their technical and artistic triumphs have resulted in a stable of virtual film stars that teenagers could easily fall for .
supercomputer pioneer and former disney vice president danny hillis is one of those whose work has made all this possible .
now with the firm applied minds , mr hillis is a man with a passion for multimedia .
" the evolution of computer graphics can best be understood as part of the ... evolution of human intelligence and its relationship to the natural world , " he says in his keynote address to siggraph .
dog eat dog on the subject of evolution , bill tomlinson 's alpha wolf installation , developed at mit 's media labs , is a chance to experience its principles at first hand .
it allows users to interact socially with a pack of autonomous virtual wolves on screen .
whether your interest is in the biological principles of natural selection and the ecological threat to wolves in the wild , or you are just a stressed out executive struggling to pull together an unruly office team , this package is a real education .
it seems to sum up what siggraph is all about this year .
as the 40,000 attendees jostle for a sight of the latest big thing , it is the convergence of multimedia technology and hard science that is likely impress the most .

agriculture minister with responsibility for animal health elliot morley called farmers " a pretty ungrateful lot " and rural recovery co-ordinator lord haskins said they were better off than ever before .
according to the sunday telegraph , mr morley 's comments were made before the foot-and-mouth crisis , in a letter to a constituent sent following last year 's fuel protests .
disease facts total : 1,944 new cases saturday : 2 slaughtered : 3,716,000 awaiting slaughter : 15,000 awaiting disposal : 3,000 angry farm leaders said such views would antagonise the very sensitive feelings of communities struggling with the effects of the disease .
in the letter mr morley said : " no one in this country has a guaranteed right to an income or a living and businesses change all the time .
" i sometimes think that farmers are a pretty ungrateful lot . "
he did however concede that farmers were left with " difficult choices " and although the outburst came ahead of foot-and-mouth , it coincided with a crisis in farming which saw many facing financial ruin .
financial ruin in a statement the department for environment , food and rural affairs said mr morley 's comments had not been aimed at all farmers but only those taking part in the fuel protests who did not enjoy the support of the wider farming community .
" his letter in fact poses questions about the future of farming rather than levelling accusations , " the statement said .
" of course there will always be some demands that we are not able to meet but the government remains committed to working with farmers to secure a sustainable , vibrant and viable future for farming and the wider rural community . "
sources close to mr morley pointed out that his letter had been written in his capacity as a constituency mp rather than as an agriculture minister .
lord haskins told the sunday telegraph he thought those who had lost their herds through foot-and-mouth were better off than those who had not .
he said : " what i know is that in this foot-and-mouth crisis , the people who have economically come out best of all have been the farmers who have had foot-and-mouth .
sensitive " they have lost their assets but they have got the interest on the money until they re-stock . "
the president of the national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- , ben gill , said lord haskins ' comments were insensitive and showed how " out of touch " he was with reality .
speaking on the bbc one 's breakfast with frost programme : " if he carries on making statements such as this , all he is going to do is antagonise the very sensitive feelings that are prevalent throughout the areas he has been asked to look at .
" what we need to do is have sensitivity and understanding for a region that in north cumbria has had 75 % of its livestock killed and is under extreme tension at the moment .
he added that people 's thoughts should be with both farmers who have been ' slaughtered out ' and those he called " the forgotten farmers " .
" those in many cases who have livestock on their farms , who have fought this virus off during that period and have had very little or no income during it , " he said .

mr beazley was reacting to a call last week from the national crime authority -lrb- nca -rrb- for the legal distribution of heroin to make dealing in it less profitable to traffickers , saying the war against organised drug crime has been lost .
absolutely savage on the people who profit from the proceeds of this wretched trade , and easy on the kids who are the victims of it kim beazley the nca proposed a trial programme to distribute heroin to medically-supervised addicts from a state-run repository .
the australian prime minister , john howard , has rejected the idea , saying improved drugs education and police action is a better strategy to bust criminal gangs .
labor is tipped to win the federal elections expected at the end of the year .
" we believe in encouraging the treatments like naltrexone , all the various rehabilitation processes and we are prepared to consider favourably an approach from the states in relation to this , " he told australian broadcasting corp television 's insider programme .
improved interception however , mr beazley said that in tandem with help for addicts labor wanted to see a tougher stance on traffickers and to strengthen the coast guard and its drug interception efforts .
" if we could sum up in just a couple of words , i would say this - absolutely savage on the people who profit from the proceeds of this wretched trade , and easy on the kids who are the victims of it , " he said .
the nca has argued that allowing doctors to prescribe heroin would reduce drug dealers ' profits and remove them from the streets .
mr beazley said that he had changed his attitude to heroin trials after sitting down with colleagues and studying strategies to deal with the drug problem .
the number of heroin addicts in australia is put at several thousand .
a government drugs survey in 1998 said that 0.7 % of the population aged over 15 used heroin - higher than western europe and the us , according to the un office for drug control and crime prevention .
