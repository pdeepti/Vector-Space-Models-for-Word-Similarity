bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- cabinet reshuffling pored over low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo sunday , 10 june , 2001 , 05:35 gmt 06:35 uk cabinet reshuffling pored over the names of gordon brown and robin cook , and the subject of the euro , seem inextricably linked in some of the sunday papers .
according to the observer , mr cook was axed from the foreign office because tony blair feared a " major row " was about to erupt between him and the chancellor over the single currency .
a cartoon in the independent on sunday depicts the prime minister telling mr cook : " you met all the criteria for demotion " .
the paper says the new leader of the house has made it clear he will not be gagged .
the chancellor seems more determined than ever to put the issue of the single currency on ice , according to the sunday times .
in what the paper calls an " unprecedented attack on another arm of government " , it claims that the treasury has urged the new foreign secretary , jack straw , to tame the foreign office 's enthusiasm for the euro .
turf war ' victim ' the sunday express sees mr cook as a victim of a bitter turf war between tony blair and gordon brown .
it says mr brown demanded mr cook 's humiliating demotion and replacement by mr straw to shore up his own powerbase ahead of the promised referendum on the euro .
not everything is going gordon brown 's way though , according to the mail on sunday - allies of the chancellor are said to be " furious " over a cabinet reshuffle they see as a " stitch up " by tony blair to shift the balance of power in his favour and away from mr brown .
" the character of the cabinet is unmistakeable , " writes roy hattersley in the same paper , " it is blairite from top to bottom . "
the sunday mirror speaks of a five-hour row during the reshuffle , with robin cook threatening to quit politics and gordon brown clashing with tony blair in a vain attempt to stamp his own authority on the revamping of whitehall .
tory leadership battle according to the news of the world , right-wing conservatives are locked in a desperate battle to stop michael portillo and kenneth clarke hijacking the leadership race .
the paper says the two are believed to be considering options for a joint campaign , despite their opposing views on the euro .
biggs begs release the train robber , ronnie biggs , who has suffered a fourth stroke , has written a letter to the sunday people , pleading to be freed from jail to die in peace .
he was apparently told by other inmates that it was the sunday people that secured the release of reggie kray shortly before his death .
biggs says that although he does not have the strength to hug his son , he has been chained to his hospital bed and surrounded by six prison officers .
" is this justice " , he asks .
jack mills , the son of the train driver , john mills , has called the letter " sickening " .
in an editorial , the paper says biggs should be shown pity and moved to an open prison .
police pursuit police forces across britain are aiming to triple the number of motorists fined for speeding each year from one million to three million , according to the sunday times .
senior police officers have apparently calculated that enough money will be generated to instal 9,000 extra speed cameras around britain .
the paper believes the figures could be higher and it points out that a pilot scheme run by essex police led to the number of motorists caught by camera rising from 1,000 in 1999 to 7,000 the following year .

" in gagging their opponents , they risk driving them to terrorist organisations and there exists in central asia a real danger of extremism , notably islamic fundamentalism , " mr geoana said .

he said the organisation was offering help with issues of security , the economy and the environment , to encourage the central asian states to move more aggressively to develop democracy .
the region is of critical importance , he noted , because of its strategic location and also because of its abundant natural resources including gas and oil .

as supporters took to the streets to celebrate his second term , the reformist president pledged to " deepen democracy " .
the nation has strived to present a right and just model of a civil society based on a religion and morality alongside democracy and freedom president khatami with just under 77 % of the vote - even more than in his victory four years ago - mr khatami returns to office with a clear and strong mandate to promote reforms .
but analysts say the hardline establishment will use every means to obstruct change , as they have done for the past four years .
and the conservative hardliners have considerable power to do so in a country where all major decisions rest with the religious authorities .
iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei controls the armed forces , appoints the judiciary chief , the head of the state broadcasting monopoly and other unelected offices .
threat to reform friday 's turnout was about 10 % lower than four years ago , as about one million voters stayed away , perhaps out of disappointment at the slow pace of change in mr khatami 's first term .
mr khatami 's nearest rival - among nine mostly independent conservatives - was ahmad tavakoli with about 16 % of the vote .
the bbc 's jim muir in teheran says that such an endorsement of mr khatami 's reformist plans may provoke a hardline backlash in the short term .
he says hard-core right-wingers have apparently accepted their unpopularity at the polls ; they did not even field a serious candidate .
but that has not inhibited them from wielding their power , because , ultimately , they believe their authority comes from god , not from the people .
analysts do not rule out that some sectors may resort to violence to resist reform .
' deeper democracy ' but , say observers , some moderate conservatives may decide to opt for constructive opposition within a democratic system .
mr khatami himself prefers to use persuasion rather than confrontation to implement social and political reform .
in his message , he spoke of " a legal , healthy and open atmosphere , freedom of speech and even opposition within the framework of the law " as being " the condition for greater and quicker victory . "
" what is necessary for our today and tomorrow is to strengthen and deepen a system of democracy and to realise the rights of the people in the light of religion , " he said .

the joy of text show , screened on bbc one on saturday , was the biggest ever mass text exercise receiving more than 500,000 text messages , a spokesman said .
the messages sent to the programme , presented live by ulrika jonsson , will now be compiled into a spin-off book .
" nothing like this mass text has ever happened before and as far as we are aware this will be the fastest book ever written , " said a spokeswoman for the publisher , transworld .
not only will this book be the fastest ever written , it also has several million potential authors doug young the bbc collaborated with mobile phone companies and used new technology to allow such a large number of messages to be received .
the book , which will also be called the joy of text , will be edited by doug young who created the fastest published book - 100 recipes in no time at all .
that book was produced in 48 hours for the challenge anneka tv show .
live poll viewers of the joy of text show took part in a live poll on the use of text messaging .
it indicated that 66 % of people use text messages to avoid talking , 52 % to apologise , 48 % to gossip , 37 % to flirt , 37 % to say : " i luv u " , 34 % to lie , 20 % to ask for a date , and 6 % to end a relationship .
text messages have been put to a range of different uses in the last 12 months .
ulrika jonsson recently presented dog eat dog on bbc one the guardian newspaper ran a text message poetry competition and bridget jones fans can get daily messages from their heroine .
a text message sent from bali to england helped save 14 tourists stranded in a boat , while smokers hoping to quit can be sent messages encouraging them to fight the nicotine cravings .
last year at the edinburgh fringe festival theatre goers could follow a play via messages on their phone and earlier this year mtv uk launched a service to allow viewers to choose videos via messages on their phones .
but text messages have also fallen foul of the law .
a farm worker in scotland was fined £ 100 for sending obscene mobile phone text messages to a man he accused of wrecking his marriage .
