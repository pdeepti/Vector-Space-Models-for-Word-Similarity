a report published by the commons public accounts committee -lrb- pac -rrb- has condemned the number of vacant properties as unacceptably high .

the public is also paying £ 60m a year for houses provided for mod personnel that have been demolished .
in cases where the mod still has an interest in the site , the payments are due for up to 25 years after demolition under an agreement with the company which owns the bulk of the estate .
rising costs the committee has asked the mod to report back every three months on the progress it has made in reducing the number of vacant quarters .
" this level of vacancies is unacceptably high and represents a significant drain on resources , costing some £ 41 million a year in rent and maintenance , " the report said .
an mod spokesman said its housing executive was proving successful in disposing of its properties .
he said the mod got rid of 6,000 homes between january last year and march this year .
however , the report says : " vacant houses cost the taxpayer money whether or not they are planned or for disposal , awaiting upgrade or are simply surplus to requirements . "

australia agreed that east timor should receive 90 % of royalties from australian mining operations for liquid petroleum and gas oil under the timor sea between the two countries . "
this will not make the people of east timor rich but it will give them a chance " un administrator australian aid agencies say they are delighted with the new agreement .
impoverished east timor faces an enormous development task , they say , and this should dramatically reduce the dangers of having to depend on foreign loans .
the shattered east timorese economy has been largely propped up by aid donors , notably australia , former colonial power portugal and the united nations .
passport to progress australia 's foreign minister , alexander downer , who flew to the capital , dili , to sign the agreement , described it as a great moment for for east timor .
the project could generate up to $ 5bn to be shared out over 20 years from 2004 according to the un .
" fundamentally this means the difference between being mired in poverty and dependent on foreign aid , and being able to make progress , " the chief negotiator with the current united nations administration , peter galbraith , told afp news agency .
he said he thought east timor would use the money to provide education and basic health care , and to continue rebuilding the territory .
the bbc 's correspondent in sydney , red harrison , says the deal represents a substantial gain over previous agreements with indonesia , under which revenue was to be shared 50-50 .
" this will not make the people of east timor rich but it will give them a chance , " said mr galbraith .
year-long talks australian and east timorese officials reached agreement on the deal late on tuesday after 12 months of protracted negotiations .
spokesmen for east timor 's transitional government say the new agreement is founded on international recognition for east timor 's claims over the geographic boundary between the two countries .
the foreign envoy of east timor 's interim administration , nobel peace laureate jose ramos horta , said the money would generate jobs , which in turn would stabilise the economy .
after 24 years of guerrilla warfare following indonesia 's 1975 invasion , east timor 's economy was devastated by pro-indonesian militia violence in the wake of the 1999 independence .

the scheme would operate along the same lines as yearly medical check-ups , except consultations would review the health of someone 's finances - especially their pension arrangements .
the report recommends that each employee should have a minimum of two hours a year and that the " wealth check " should be written into employment contracts .
british society is , in effect , sleepwalking into a financial future for which it is ill prepared sir john banham , chairman of the inquiry the institute believes that providing such advice would prevent the financial timebomb facing many people in their old age , because it would encourage them to think about their finances and save for their retirement .
it also said that through free market principles , the entire financial services industry could benefit .
it believes that with more people having access to financial advice , companies would be forced to offer higher standards of service and greater transparency .
the recommendations are central to a new report " in place of micawber : empowering financial consumers " which will be presented to government officials and regulators on thursday .
it was commissioned in response to a growing concern from the government and industry bodies that people are not saving enough for their future , and has been led by sir john banham , chairman of kingfisher - the retail giant .
sir john said : " it is now commonplace for employers to offer their staff access to services such as medical health checks as an employee benefit .
providing access to financial advice would operate in a very similar way . "
at the same time , the institute believes that the move would be good for businesses because it would improve retention rates and promote companies as caring and supportive employers .
growing concern sir john said : " british society is , in effect , sleepwalking into a financial future for which it is ill prepared . "
according to the report , less than one family in five is making adequate financial provision for old age .
it says that this is britain 's " wake up " call for the crisis facing many people in the future .
government and industry bodies are becoming increasingly concerned with how little people are saving for their retirement .
institute of actuaries says there is an urgent need to review annuity rules low inflation combined with poor stock market performance are diminishing returns from pension funds .
each £ 1,000 invested in uk equities between 1973 and 1993 returned on average £ 5,800 .
but the same amount invested today would be worth only £ 2,200 .
and a 45-year old needs to save 2.5 times more than his father to secure the same pension in real terms .
sir john believes that part of the problem can be resolved through an urgent review of current annuity rules .
private pension holders must use 75 % of their pension fund to buy an annuity by the time they are 75 years old .
but purchasing an annuity effectively eliminates the possibility of passing on any capital to children - and condemns pensioners to a fixed income for the rest of their life at the rate when they bought the annuity .
at present , annuity rates are very low because of stock market conditions - and many people are having to put off retirement altogether until the situation improves or semi-retire .

the racecourse has been given the all-clear to start holding meetings again , following the decision to halt the programme in january .
racing has been scheduled to restart at 1400bst on thursday .
the decision to suspend meetings earlier this year came as other sporting fixtures - including the wales-ireland six nations clash in cardiff and the rally of wales - became casualties of the disease .
the stereophonics were forced to switch venues stephen jones , executive director of chepstow racecourse , said at the time that all races have been called off as a result of professional advice .
he said ministry of agriculture officials , and the course 's own vets , had urged him to take precautionary measures .
horses are not affected by foot-and-mouth , but can be carriers of the disease , and the sport has been badly-hit by previous outbreaks .
in 1967 , a foot-and-mouth epidemic swept britain and horse racing was banned for several weeks .
earlier this year , welsh rock band the stereophonics announced that the massive open-air concert due to be held at chepstow racecourse would be held at the millennium stadium .
originally billed as " a day at the races " , the chepstow concert had been expected to attract a record crowd of 80,000 fans .
but the 21 july event was thrown into doubt by the foot-and-mouth outbreak , when it was discoverd that the racecourse was an infected area .
