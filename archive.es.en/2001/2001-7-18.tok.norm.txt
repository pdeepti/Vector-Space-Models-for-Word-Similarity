mr bush will then fly to genoa for the group of eight summit of leading world powers , where discussions are likely to be dominated by the thorny issues of global warming and missile defence .
on the eve of his uk visit , the president also called on the ira and other paramilitary groups in northern ireland to decommission their weapons , and offered to play a greater mediatory role .
earlier this week , mr bush said the visit would " confirm and renew " the strong relationship between britain and america .

" i 've got an obligation to the working people of america " , he told the bbc , " to pursue a policy that protects the environment but also promotes economic growth . "
in defending his ambitious plan for a missile defence shield , the president was animated and adamant .
he told the bbc : " it 's about time a leader stepped forward and made it clear that russia is not the enemy , and therefore we should n't have a treaty that was written to clarify that status ... it 's a new day . "

the bbc 's stephen sackur , who interviewed the president , says it seems no amount of global opposition or scepticism is going to stop mr bush making a fundamental change to the strategic balance .
however , our correspondent says even before his departure , it is clear this trip is going to be another round of difficult transatlantic diplomacy .
elsewhere mr bush told the world bank in a speech that it should give more grants and fewer loans to the poorest nations .
the proposals will form part of the us position at the forthcoming g8 summit of world leaders in genoa which begins on thursday .

the firm reported profits of $ 61m in the third quarter , sharply lower than the $ 200m in the same period a year earlier .
and , speaking on the eve of the twice-yearly macworld trade fair , chief financial officer fred anderson said he was " not counting on " and imminent recovery .
" we have not seen any signs of an upturn in the consumer pc market , " he said in a conference after the close of us stock markets .
the forecast concerned wall street , where apple shares fell $ 2.35 to $ 22.75 in after-hours trading .
revival strategy nonetheless , apple shares have been one of the top performers in the us this year , rising by two thirds , as investors have warmed to the revival strategy being rolled out by steve jobs , the firm 's co-founder , who has returned as chief executive .
steve jobs : has spearheaded apple 's revival and apple 's third-quarter profits , which were in line with analysts ' forecasts , were higher than the $ 40m earned in the three months before .
sales came in at $ 1.48bn , compared with $ 1.43bn the quarter before and $ 1.83bn a year ago .
much of the recent rise in sales was credited on a strong performance by the ibook notebook computer , introduced on 1 may .
" -lsb- apple -rsb- seemed to hit a sweet spot in the market with the ibook , " ubs warburg analyst don young said .
the firm also reported strong sales to schools .
" education is humming , " mr anderson said .
key show apple is expected to bolster future revenue with new products which may be unveiled by mr jobs at wednesday 's macworld show , in new york .
observers are predicting the launch of a budget-priced imac desktop model .
" this is probably the biggest challenge facing apple going forward , " said david bailey , analyst at gerard klauer mattison .
" because of the narrowness of their customer segments they are more dependent on product introductions than other pc manufacturers . "
product shelved after losing nearly $ 250m at the end of 2000 , the computer maker vowed to return to profitability .
apple has lived up to its word , driven in part by strong demand for an attractive new laptop computer .
but a lagging pc sector combined with the company 's misstep around its g4 cube computer have shaken investor confidence in the company .
apple abandoned its ultra-modern g4 cube earlier this month , saying it would suspend production of the personal computer indefinitely .
the company opened its first two retail stores last quarter and plans to open 23 more this year .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- intel profits slump 76 % low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's stephen evans , in new york " intel is one of the pillars of the computer revolution " real 56k wednesday , 18 july , 2001 , 06:54 gmt 07:54 uk intel profits slump 76 % the pentium 4 processor : " critical " to intel 's future the world 's largest chipmaker , intel , has pledged to shake up its sales operations after reporting profits down by three-quarters .
the firm has announced an aggressive push of its pentium 4 chips and a " very single-minded drive " to phase out old-generation products , in an effort to revive underlying profits which fell to $ 854m in the three months to 30 june .
the figure , equivalent to 12 cents a share , was higher than the 10 cents a share forecast made by wall street analysts .
but it compared with a figure of 50 cents a share reported in the april-june quarter last year .
concern over forecasts the apparent inability of intel to predict future earnings accurately also unnerved analysts a range of $ 6.2-6.8bn for sales in the current quarter was " very wide " , said justin mcnichols , portfolio manager with osborne capital management .
" what the -lsb- markets -rsb- were hoping for was some kind of flat guidance , " he added .
intel shares , which had risen on tuesday , fell $ 0.45 to $ 29.45 in after-hours trading .
the breadth of the forecast also depressed shares in tokyo , where the benchmark nikkei index closed 1.95 % down at 11,892.58 points .
" given such poor visibility , people can not be optimistic about investing in tech issues , " said hidenori kawasaki , general manager at kokusai .
' critical ' chip intel 's decision to push pentium 4 sales comes as growing competition from advanced micro devices -lrb- amd -rrb- has added to problems of slack demand for chips , amid the slowdown in economic growth worldwide .
amd microprocessors have received critical acclaim in recent months , topping the performance of comparable intel chips in some tests .
" intel has a fairly significant problem - the pentium 4 is critical because it starts to open up a gap -lsb- with -rsb- competitors , " said steve kleynhans , vice president and analyst at meta group .
" amd has obviously ... surpassed the pentium 3 .
pentium 4 is tanking badly in the market and -lsb- intel will -rsb- do everything to ensure that pentium 4 becomes the mainstream chip . "
ashok kumar , an analyst at us bancorp piper jaffray , said : " intel are trying to drive a stake through amd 's heart . "
differing demand however , intel reported a resilient market overall for chips used in making pcs , with the volumes of chip sales rising 6 % , albeit at lower prices .
" this gives us confidence that the stronger seasonal second half that we typically experience will happen , " intel 's chief financial officer andy bryant said .
but demand for chips used in telephones and digital cameras was weak , reflecting the experience of uk 's telecoms equipment maker marconi , which has noted a " very , very significant " slowdown in europe , and indeed amd itself .
amd said last week it had been hit hard by a slump in sales of the chips , and warned it may fall into the red .
