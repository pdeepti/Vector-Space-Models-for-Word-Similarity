the news has provoked a furious outcry from some argentine politicians .
one senator has called the move a desperate act .
first a new wife - next a new political career ?
mr menem has been formally charged with running an arms trafficking group which illegally sold thousands of tons of weapons to croatia and ecuador in the early 1990s .
some say that running for the senate is a way for the flamboyant ex-leader to secure parliamentary immunity from this prosecution .
however , his brother , eduardo menem , has strongly denied this allegation , saying that it is merely a political gesture .
carlos menem , who is aiming to target his native province of la rioja , will have to conduct his campaign from under house arrest in a buenos aires suburb .
whilst the 71-year-old concentrates on relaunching his political career his successor , president fernando de la rua , continues the struggle to drag argentina out of its current economic crisis .

scientists in the united states claim humans are built from 66,000 genes , nearly twice as many as the current consensus .
some researchers are unsettled by the certainty with which the human genome consortium is presenting its lower gene count fred wright , ohio state university two draft versions of the human genome were published in february this year , in what was hailed as a landmark in scientific achievement .
the publicly funded human genome project and a private us firm , celera genomics , put the number of human genes at around 35,000 .
now a third team , based at ohio state university , columbus , ohio , has reanalysed the raw data , using a supercomputer , and come up with a higher estimate for the number of human genes .
" we ended up with a higher estimated number of genes than the other two teams because we compared 13 different gene databases to the dna sequences in the draft genome produced by the human genome project , " said bo yuan of ohio state university .
the news that humans had 30,000 to 40,000 genes came as a surprise to many experts , when the findings were published in the scientific journals nature and science .
the tally was much lower than the 100,000 or more expected .
scientists now had to explain how a complex human could be built from about 35,000 genes , compared to the nematode worm with 18,000 and the fruit fly with 13,000 .
one explanation for the difference between humans and fruit flies or worms is that human genes work differently and we have more control genes .
but some researchers remain unconvinced .
they believe there are more human genes hidden in the genome .
the discrepancy seems to arise from the process used to analyse human genetic data .
the human genome is a string of three billion dna letters , comprising all the instructions needed to make a human being .
buried within these coded instructions are the genes - " sentences " which hold the instructions for the proteins of which human tissue is made .
the genes occupy only about a hundredth of the length of the huge string of dna , broken up into the 46 chromosomes in every cell .
to fish out the genes , which are hidden among the long continuous string of letters , scientists rely on genetic databases .
the human genome the genome is the complete list of coded instructions needed to make a person there are 3.1 billion letters in the dna code in every one of the 100 trillion cells in the human body if all of the dna in the human body were put end to end , it would reach to the sun and back more than 600 times .
the ohio state university team says celera 's genome map , and particularly , the human genome project map relied mainly on two databases to locate the genes .
they used these two databases plus 11 others .
" we used more experimental evidence in assembling our map , and that suggests that there are probably between 65,000 and 75,000 transcriptional units , " said dr yuan .
a transcriptional unit is a length of dna that shows strong evidence of being a gene but which requires future verification .
this is where the dispute arises .
" some researchers are unsettled by the certainty with which the human genome consortium is presenting its lower gene count , " said fred wright of ohio state university .
" in my view , the final number of genes - when it is known - will lie somewhere between their high of 40,000 and our value of 70,000 . "
but the new analysis , published on the website of the journal genome biology , has been dismissed by the sanger centre , in cambridgeshire , uk , which was responsible for about a third of the human genome sequencing effort .
the experimental evidence actually points to 30-40,000 genes dr tim hubbard , sanger centre tim hubbard , head of human genome analysis at the sanger centre , said the work was flawed .
" the experimental evidence actually points to 30-40,000 genes , " dr hubbard told bbc news online .
" i do n't believe the argument in this paper that there are a lot more genes .
this is an entirely computational paper and i do n't think it 's very credible .
" the real test will come from experiments to see if what computers suggest are genes , are actually real genes , " he added .
arguments over how many genes it takes to build a human being look set to continue .
a gene sweepstake set up by scientists attending the cold spring harbor genome meetings in the united states is still taking entries .
to date , there have been 165 bets , ranging from 27,462 to 153,478 human genes .
so far , the money is on 61,710 .

john archer has held the post since scottish screen was created five years ago and the quango is currently one of 63 being scrutinised by the scottish executive .
scottish screen has been under fire recently because of the film projects it has funded .
it is been criticised for not funding a wide enough range of films , or enough commercially successful ones .
it is also been accused of " cronyism " favouring a small group of filmmakers already known to the board .
john archer : planned a radical shake-up mr archer , as its chief executive has been in the front line , most recently when a project by his wife 's company was given a lottery grant .
while he was not directly involved in the decision , it did prove embarrassing , particularly as the quango is one of 63 being scrutinised by politicians over its future .
lottery funds more relevant to the resignation was his plans for a radical shake-up of the agency , plans which proved to be at odds with the board of scottish screen .
mr archer says he will stay in his post until a successor is appointed and the process of finding a new chief executive has already begun .
last year , scottish screen was awared lottery funds to allocate within the film industry .
the then enterprise minister henry mcleish welcomed the move , saying : " i hope that scottish screen will be working with public and private bodies in scotland over the next few months to work up proposals for a film charter . "

mr archer , as its chief executive has been in the front line , most recently when a project by his wife 's company was given a lottery grant .
while he was not directly involved in the decision , it did prove embarrassing , particularly as the quango is one of 63 being scrutinised by politicians over its future .
lottery funds more relevant to the resignation was his plans for a radical shake-up of the agency , plans which proved to be at odds with the board of scottish screen .
mr archer says he will stay in his post until a successor is appointed and the process of finding a new chief executive has already begun .
last year , scottish screen was awared lottery funds to allocate within the film industry .
the then enterprise minister henry mcleish welcomed the move , saying : " i hope that scottish screen will be working with public and private bodies in scotland over the next few months to work up proposals for a film charter . "

upon his succession to the throne charles will become supreme governor of the church , which has strict rules on the remarriage of divorcees .
mrs parker bowles is divorced and her former husband andrew is still alive - circumstances under which the church would not normally conduct a marriage service .
the prince of wales is now a widower and he is free to re-marry bishop of durham perhaps most controversially , the wife of a future king would automatically become a future queen .
because of the rules governing the remarriage of divorcees , wedding camilla would threaten to undermine charles 's moral authority as the head of the church .
religious obstacles there has been religious opposition to the idea of the couple becoming man and wife , although it is not universal .
more than half of england 's bishops rejected the idea in a 1996 poll .
and in 1997 , the archbishop of canterbury , dr george carey , controversially warned that charles 's remarriage would throw the church into crisis .
but in 1998 , the bishop of durham , the right reverend michael turnbull , said charles could remarry and still maintain the moral authority to become head of the church .
queen camilla ?
" morally and ethically it would be more desirable for them to marry than for the situation to remain as it is , " said the bishop .
" the prince of wales is , sadly , now a widower and he is free to re-marry . "
the issue of divorcees being allowed to remarry in church is being discussed by members of the anglican church at their general synod on saturday .
but even if the church were to change its practice , there is the question of whether the public will ever accept mrs parker bowles as queen .
under present constitutional law , she would assume this role as soon as charles acceded to the throne .
public opinion has shifted in favour of the couple marrying , although there is still doubt over whether mrs parker bowles should become queen .
according to a newspaper poll last year , there would be widespread public support for the couple to wed .
of the 1,200 people asked in a survey for the mirror , 68 % believed they should marry .
but 83 % said mrs parker bowles should never become queen .
the historical irony of the marriage debate is that the church of england owes its very existence to henry viii 's wish to divorce his first wife .

upon his succession to the throne charles will become supreme governor of the church , which has strict rules on the remarriage of divorcees .
mrs parker bowles is divorced and her former husband andrew is still alive - circumstances under which the church would not normally conduct a marriage service .
the prince of wales is now a widower and he is free to re-marry bishop of durham perhaps most controversially , the wife of a future king would automatically become a future queen .
because of the rules governing the remarriage of divorcees , wedding camilla would threaten to undermine charles 's moral authority as the head of the church .
religious obstacles camilla and andrew parker bowles are divorced there has been religious opposition to the idea of the couple becoming man and wife , although it is not universal .
more than half of england 's bishops rejected the idea in a 1996 poll .
and in 1997 , the archbishop of canterbury , dr george carey , controversially warned that charles 's remarriage would throw the church into crisis .
but in 1998 , the bishop of durham , the right reverend michael turnbull , said charles could remarry and still maintain the moral authority to become head of the church .
queen camilla ?
" morally and ethically it would be more desirable for them to marry than for the situation to remain as it is , " said the bishop .
" the prince of wales is , sadly , now a widower and he is free to re-marry . "
camilla parker bowles : could become charles 's queen the issue of divorcees being allowed to remarry in church is being discussed by members of the anglican church at their general synod on saturday .
but even if the church were to change its practice , there is the question of whether the public will ever accept mrs parker bowles as queen .
under present constitutional law , she would assume this role as soon as charles acceded to the throne .
public opinion has shifted in favour of the couple marrying , although there is still doubt over whether mrs parker bowles should become queen .
according to a newspaper poll last year , there would be widespread public support for the couple to wed .
of the 1,200 people asked in a survey for the mirror , 68 % believed they should marry .
but 83 % said mrs parker bowles should never become queen .
the historical irony of the marriage debate is that the church of england owes its very existence to henry viii 's wish to divorce his first wife .
