the first analysis of the work of air ambulance services , published by the national association of air ambulance services -lrb- naaas -rrb- , showed road traffic accidents -lrb- rtas -rrb- account for half of all air ambulance missions .
the naaas has set up a national network of services , with 18 air ambulances operating across britain .
ninety per cent of the british population are within 30 minutes flying time of an air ambulance .
air ambulances now cover 90 % of the population between march and august 2001 , the network responded to 6,774 callouts , including 3,201 road accidents .
john dawson , director of public policy for the aa which supports the naaas and spokesperson for the naaas said : " air ambulances work as part of the health service and with other emergency services to ensure a rapid response to accidents and to transport the seriously injured to hospital .
" they are , increasingly , the first emergency service to arrive at the scene of some of the country 's most serious accidents .
" we know that the speed that air ambulances achieve can often make the difference between life and death , and also increases patients ability to recover in the long term . "
speed of response richard diment , chief executive of the ambulance service association told bbc news online : " the biggest thing is that in remote areas we can get to the patient quickly ambulance services provide paramedic staff for the air ambulance services , and are responsible for despatching them .
we know that the speed that air ambulances achieve can often make the difference between life and death john dawson , naaas spokesman " and if you send an air ambulance to do the job , you 've actually got a conventional land ambulance left to do another job . "
he added that air ambulances can be used to transfer patients between hospitals or for specialist treatment , which would take much longer in a conventional ambulance .
running an air ambulance on average costs £ 720,000 a year .
each is staffed by paramedics , though some services carry doctors and specialists .
the second most common reason for air ambulances to be called out is medical emergencies such as heart attacks .
sport and leisure related accidents , such as horse riding incidents , account for 8 % of call outs , while work-related incidents , such as farm accidents account for 3 % .
the cost of two flights in an air ambulance costs £ 1,000 - the same as a day in intensive care .

the race in democratic primaries was too close to call and it appeared tuesday night that the two leading candidates , mark green and fernando ferrer , were headed for a run-off .
voting in the primary elections began on 11 september , but was halted just hours after two hijacked planes crashed into the world trade center 's twin towers , leaving thousands dead when the buildings collapsed .
the popularity of incumbent mayor rudolph giuliani soared as he led his city through the crisis , and there have been widespread calls for him to stay on , despite laws barring him from seeking a third consecutive term .
clear win according to the exit polls , mr bloomberg defeated former us congressman herman badillo in the primary elections by 66 % to 34 % .
among the democrats , exit polls showed none of the four candidates won the required 40 % of votes , forcing a run-off on 11 october between the two leading candidates .
mr green , the city 's consumer watchdog , won 34 % of the vote , and mr ferrer , the hispanic mayor of the bronx borough , received 32 % of the votes , according to exit polls .
" this city is at a crossroads , " mr bloomberg told his supporters on tuesday night .
" we weathered the crisis and now we face the rebuilding , an enterprise no city has ever dealt with before . "
the billionaire political novice has reportedly spent more than $ 20m on his campaign .
the primaries ' official results are not expected until the weekend , after absentee ballots and write-in ballots are counted .
in demand some voters have written in mr giuliani 's name on the ballot paper next to the six official candidates , despite explicit advice from their mayor not to do so .
a poll cited by the reuters news agency , and published on tuesday , reveals that over 50 % of new yorkers want mr giuliani to be the mayor who leads his city through a major rebuilding operation .
for him to stay on , the republican governor of new york state , george pataki , would have to introduce emergency legislation to extend mr giuliani 's term , or the city council would have to amend the city charter to allow further terms .
but even some of the voters who admire mr giuliani 's handling of the city 's crisis say the democratic process should be upheld and a new mayor elected .
political analysts say that even if mr giuliani does not stay on as mayor , his prospects look good to run for governor .
" it means that , whether he runs for governor in two years or governor in six years , his options will be enormous , " us analyst phil friedman told the bbc .
" more than that , it means that he will become an international as well as a national leader and he 'll be in demand as a speaker and as a leader around the world . "

one of the high-performance yamahas - far more powerful than normal patrol bikes - will go out without police markings .
it will also have a video camera mounted on it .
the norfolk force has made a similar move , putting police markings on a suzuki 1300cc hayabusa , the world 's fastest production bike .
the devon and cornwall campaign follows a rise in the number of bikers dying on the region 's roads .
rusty riders last year 20 motorcyclists made up a quarter of the people killed on roads in the two counties .
nearly all were aged over 25 .
middle-aged riders returning to two wheels on more expensive machines are at risk because their skills are rusty and their reactions slow .
police released a rider 's own danger video devon and cornwall police have staged a number of bikesafe training days for older riders to improve safety .
a spokesman said the force was not trying to spoil riders ' enjoyment but it wanted to reduce the death toll .
this month the force released video film shot by a biker with a camera mounted on his own fuel tank .
andrew kitt of st austell filmed himself speeding , pulling wheelies and overtaking other vehicles on blind bends .
two weeks later , on 6 may 2001 , the 28-year-old died in a collision .

doctors have welcomed the opening of a clinical school in swansea but warn that still more needs to be done to increase medical student numbers in wales .
the establishment of a medical school in the city is an issue for which doctors in wales have campaigned long and hard .
run in partnership with local hospitals , the school has been praised by the british medical association but it has pointed out that to meet wales needs more medical students future healthcare demands even greater efforts will be needed .
local gps who have to contend with the day-to-day pressures of the nhs say that an extra 1,500 doctors need to be trained each year to bring the uk up to the standard of its european neighbours .
dr bryn john of the british medical association said : " we will have to have at least one other clinical school in wales producing at least double the amount of graduates , if we are to reach the same levels of medical cover similar to france and germany " .
a total of 50 students who have already completed three years at cardiff medical school are now studying at swansea university and surrounding local hospitals .
professor julian hopkin of swansea clinical school said : " these are undergraduates from a broad background and i think that has important advantages .
different culture " i think it will broaden the talent we bring into medicine and i think it will make medicine more effective " .
eventually the clinical school hopes to train 75 undergraduates per year and , if the welsh assembly approves , introduce a new kind of course for students who have already completed a degree .
medical student andrew davies said : " these are smaller regional hospitals which are much more intimate so we get to know the staff better . "
" they also do n't see so many students so they are much more eager to teach you and its nice to be in a different culture , " he said .
in north wales health chiefs have also met to discuss plans to develop a clinical school in their region .

schools minister catherine ashton also announced that the united kingdom will be joining the european centre for modern languages - a specialist centre for teaching languages , based in austria .
" language skills are crucial to our future well-being and prosperity - apart from all the fun they bring , " she said .
" throughout our schools and colleges we must strengthen our commitment to language learning and make the very best of the linguistic richness and diversity of our own multicultural communities . "
joining the centre for modern languages , set up by the council of europe , was evidence of this commitment , she said .
' cutting-edge ' " the european centre for modern languages is at the cutting-edge of developing and implementing practical new approaches to modern foreign language teaching . "
earlier this year an inquiry into language teaching in the uk concluded that a radical overhaul was necessary to tackle a serious weakness in language skills .
there will be events marking the european day of languages in 45 countries , which will help to raise awareness of language learning .
this will include the " languages lift-off " , in which balloons will be launched from 18 venues across the continent - with the uk 's event taking place beside tower bridge in london .
but a survey earlier this year suggested that the uk had some way to go before catching up with the language skills held by people in other european countries .
while across the european union , an average of 53 % people knew at least one other language than their own , in the uk this figure was 34 % .

schools minister catherine ashton also announced that the united kingdom will be joining the european centre for modern languages - a specialist centre for teaching languages , based in austria .
" language skills are crucial to our future well-being and prosperity - apart from all the fun they bring , " she said .
" throughout our schools and colleges we must strengthen our commitment to language learning and make the very best of the linguistic richness and diversity of our own multicultural communities . "
joining the centre for modern languages , set up by the council of europe , was evidence of this commitment , she said .
' cutting-edge ' " the european centre for modern languages is at the cutting-edge of developing and implementing practical new approaches to modern foreign language teaching . "
earlier this year an inquiry into language teaching in the uk concluded that a radical overhaul was necessary to tackle a serious weakness in language skills .
there will be events marking the european day of languages in 45 countries , which will help to raise awareness of language learning .
this will include the " languages lift-off " , in which balloons will be launched from 18 venues across the continent - with the uk 's event taking place beside tower bridge in london .
but a survey earlier this year suggested that the uk had some way to go before catching up with the language skills held by people in other european countries .
while across the european union , an average of 53 % people knew at least one other language than their own , in the uk this figure was 34 % .

the ad market was already in a severe slump before the us attacks ; now , it has been knocked sideways .
there is a heightened state of sensitivity at the moment sue gardner , millward brown companies mulling their marketing strategy face a nasty dilemma : persist with advertising , and they may look crass ; stop advertising , and they fail in their duty to keep the economy ticking over .

will things ever get back to normal ?
sudden stop in the immediate wake of the us strikes , most companies had the same reaction - stop advertising immediately .
a swathe of consumer-oriented firms , most notably in the airline business , put advertising activity on hold .
that was partly because many media outlets took the editorial decision to dispense with advertisements in order not to detract from the weightiness of their news coverage .
but it was also because firms were terrified of committing a marketing blunder at a time when the world was glued to its tv sets , radios and newspapers .

an ad for persil , a lever faberge soap powder brand , was called off on the grounds that it featured a child who wanted to be a pilot .

two days after the attacks , newspapers in the uk ran full-page ads for telecoms firm worldcom , which had the toe-curling catchline : " are you worried your hosting provider wo n't be around tomorrow ?
you should be . "
advertising provides pleasure and escapism , and people will want more of that at the moment graham booth , team partners firms are desperate to avoid replicating the mistake , says sue gardner , managing director of millward brown , an advertising research firm .
" there is a heightened state of sensitivity at the moment , " she says .
" companies are acutely conscious of the need not to appear insensitive . "
changing tone two weeks on , advertisers are starting to creep into the open again - but with a radically different tone to their sales pitches .
the new mood is most strongly in evidence in the us , where companies have gone to great lengths to stress their patriotism and sympathy for the victims .
supermarket giants walmart and kmart have played the patriotism card strongly ; kmart , for example , made much of a donation of 50,000 us flags to the city of new york .
and on september 16 , it ran full-page ads featuring an american flag , with small print below , reading : " remove from newspaper .
place in window .
embrace freedom . "
retail rival giant food stores was even quicker , launching an " american heroes fund " on the day after the attacks .
car makers , flag wavers in the car industry , already suffering slumping sales before the attacks , the flag-waving has reached its peak .
gm launched an interest-free finance programme on september , aimed - it claimed - at helping the us economy recover .
" gm has a responsibility to help stimulate the economy by encouraging americans to purchase vehicles , " said ron zarrella , the firm 's north american president chrysler launched a campaign for its jeep range that was based on patriotic images of us soldiers beating the nazis in world war ii .
ironically , the campaign has sparked protests in germany , the home of chrysler 's parent company .
on the defensive and at the very crest of the patriotic wave was defence contractor lockheed martin , which draped its corporate website in the stars and stripes , and brought out an tv advertising campaign based on a " salute to our armed forces " .
in some cases , firms went too far .
insurance broker group insurance concepts was criticised in the us press for opportunistic profiteering .
the firm ran a banner on its website that , after offering sympathy to the bereaved , ended with " we will be happy to provide you with insurance and mortgage information . "
the company has now amended the banner .
bandwagon the group insurance concepts case was a rare one , however .
in general , overt patriotism in advertising has gone down well with the us consumer , says jack trout , president of marketing consultancy trout & partners .
" advertisers are seizing the moment to jump on the patriotism bandwagon , " he says .
" but this will fade .
i think we are already at the point where patriotic advertising is no longer necessary . "
subtlety pays off indeed , some canny companies have already started to play down the more obvious appeals to patriotic sentiment .
coca-cola , arguably the most respected marketing machine in the world , chose a more subtle approach in its post-attack campaign .
its new ads feature cal ripken , a baseball legend who recently announced his retirement .
in the commercial , mr ripken muses on his career , and plays with his 11-year-old daughter .
" this ad recognises a hero from the world of sports , but it is symbolic of ... those men and women who have given courageously and heroically of themselves during these tragic and difficult times , " said a coca-cola statement .
" they are capturing the emotion , without straying too far from where the brand is positioned , " says mr trout .
airing views another highly-praised post-attack campaign came from southwest airlines , one of the few carriers to continue advertising through the crisis .
incidentally , southwest has been the only consistently profitable major us airline .
while most rivals simply yanked their existing campaigns , southwest launched an ad-hoc series of commercials featuring founder and chairman herb kelleher , who gave a straightforward explanation of how the airline was coping with the disruption .
hope springs eternal some advertising people hope that this sort of re-positioning could spark a minor advertising boom over the next few months , as firms try to instil some spark into listless consumers .
graham booth , managing director of london advertising consultancy team research , points out that another boost could come from the surge in viewing figures and readership that the attacks have produced .
that might prove optimistic : rebounding from the current crisis would still leave the industry in the slump it has been in for most of this year .
but most advertising people agree that the current period of hyper-sensitivity and super-patriotism can not last too long .
" people want it to be business as usual , " says mr booth .
" at its best , advertising provides pleasure and escapism , and people will want more of that at the moment . "

the norwegian-based operator has negotiated a three-year loan worth 800 billion norwegian kroner -lrb- nok -rrb- , about £ 60m .
in a statement on wednesday , the company said : " the banks will work to replace kvaerner 's existing short-term loan facilities with a three-year loan , which is to be repaid at the end of the term .
about 1,500 workers are employed by kvaerner in aberdeen " the banks presume that a rights issue will be undertaken , securing proceeds of at least 1 billion -lrb- nok -rrb- .
" the board intends , however , to implement an issue of 2 billion -lrb- nok -rrb- , based on preferential rights for existing shareholders .
" given the uncertainty attached to the kvaerner share lately , and a desire to reduce risk for the new capital , the board will work to arrange the rights issue as a three-year convertible bond , either in whole or in part . "
on wednesday kvaerner and kvaerner asa shares opened at 8.0 -lrb- nor -rrb- , 0.8 lower following suspension from the stock market .
stock exchanges the company , which employs about 1,500 people in aberdeen and 7,500 in the uk as a whole , has been working to restructure its debt .
debts of about £ 500m have seen doubt cast on the firm 's viability .
bosses played down fears about job losses when shares were suspended on the oslo and london stock exchanges .
the employees at kirkhill near aberdeen have been reassured that nobody is yet looking at redundancy .
spokesman paul emberley said the firm is working on the basis that it is going to find a " satisfactory solution " .
the company says it has a financial solution commenting on the threat to jobs he said : " we are not looking at the prospect of redundancies .
that 's not on the agenda at the moment .
" the banks have accepted the fact that our underlying assets far exceed our debts but we do have this liquidity problem at the moment . "
kvaerner 's chief executive , kjell almskog , resigned last week as the share price crashed .
last year , kvaerner announced that it was pulling out of shipbuilding because of spiralling costs .
the company closed its clydebank plant with the loss of 200 jobs .

at times of international crisis , the world expects the un to swing into action , but in the aftermath of the attacks on new york and washington earlier this month , the organisation appears to have been surprisingly quiet .
this is deceptive .
amidst all the shock and chaos in the days after the attacks , the un security council quickly and unanimously adopted an important resolution on 12 september .
it condemned what it called " the horrifying terrorist attacks " , and went on to say that the security council " regards such acts , like any act of international terrorism , as a threat to international peace and security " .
self-defence the words used by the council were extremely significant .
if they are read in conjunction with article 51 of the un charter , they appear to support the right of america to respond in self-defence against the alleged perpetrators of the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon .
in addition , there are long-standing un security council resolutions on afghanistan and the taleban authorities , whom america accuses of sheltering those responsible for the attacks on the united states .
as early as october 1999 , the council adopted a resolution demanding the hand-over of osama bin laden , the exiled saudi-born millionaire and main suspect in the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon , and the bombing of us embassies in nairobi and dar-es-salaam in 1998 .
this , and a subsequent follow-up resolution adopted in december last year , also called for the closure of all terrorist camps in afghanistan , and placed an embargo on weapons sales to the taleban authorities in afghanistan .

there is also the question of how the long-term war against international terrorism should be fought .

ofgem ruling prices cut by 4 % next year prices cut by 2 % every year after that until 2007 ofgem says transco will have to cut prices by 4 % next year and by 2 % every year after that until 2007 .
gas distribution costs make up between 35-40 % of consumers gas bills and the ruling should cut about £ 5 off the price of an average bill .
but the new regime is less strict than previous proposals which would have seen transco facing a 14 % price cut in 2002 .
such a cut would have seen an average gas bill cut by about £ 15 .
share spike the regulator has also ruled that transco must spend more on renewing gas mains than the company had originally projected .
under health and safety executive rules , transco must replace all iron mains within 30 metres of buildings , within 30 years .
ofgem expects the cost of this programme to rise to about £ 2.1bn over a five year period , £ 300m less than transco 's forecast .
shares in transco 's parent company , lattice , leapt 3 % on the news before falling back below 154.75 , as traders digested the full impact of the review .
" at first sight it -lrb- the review -rrb- looks very favourable , " said one analyst .
possible appeal lattice group 's director of regulation , chris bolt , described ofgem 's price review as " extremely challenging " , and left open the possibility of an appeal to the competition commission .
" the key is whether we can continue to pay acceptable dividends to shareholders , while servicing transco 's debt and meeting any extra funding requirements , and continue to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating .
" if the board has serious doubts on this issue , that will determine the case for a competition commission reference . "
he added : " i 'm not making any predictions about an appeal to the competition commission .
that 's a matter for the board .
" we will need to do more analysis of these proposals , " he said .
although , at first sight , the review appeared to be a favourable one for transco , mr bolt insisted that there remained a " very substantial gap " between ofgem 's proposals and transco 's position .
he said the shortfall was just under £ 1.9bn , compared with a shortfall of around £ 3bn under the previous proposals .
lattice has until 25 october to lodge an appeal with the competition commission .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- q & a : comet borrelly images categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 26 september , 2001 , 09:45 gmt 10:45 uk q & a : comet borrelly images the american space agency , nasa , has published astonishing pictures of comet borrelly 's nucleus , taken by the unmanned spacecraft deep space 1 .
the mission 's director , dr marc rayman , has himself described the images as stunning .
the bbc asked him what the new close-up pictures tell us about the nature of comets .
a : the data are so new that it 's too soon to draw conclusions , but comets previously were just very , very mysterious , and now we have enough information to start putting together the pieces of a puzzle that will tell us about the nature of comets and therefore the origin and evolution of the solar system and earth , and perhaps even life on earth .
the ds1 images reveal different types of terrain what have we learnt about the kind of terrain , the landscape , on these objects ?
a : well , indeed , prior to ds1 's encounter with comet borrelly , we had a set of beautiful images of comet halley from the giotto spacecraft .
but they were n't clear enough actually to see any terrain on the comet , and now we can see not only terrain , but several different kinds of terrain .
there are plains , and maces , and jumbled rough areas and flat areas , and we can see areas that are producing high-velocity jets of material , and so it 's really like , literally , a whole new world to explore .
giotto 's image of comet halley showed us little of the surface of the nucleus so , why have n't we had images like this before now ?
what 's been the difficulty ?
a : there are several difficulties .
one is that it 's simply very difficult to get spacecraft to comets .
they have orbits which make them difficult to reach , and they present very , very challenging and difficult environments to penetrate , and , in fact , on ds1 , i actually did not have high confidence that the spacecraft would survive its passage by the comet .
in addition , it 's only been recently that the full scientific importance of comets has begun to be appreciated , and that then has led to a renewed interest in comet missions .
so what , just to sum up , would you say is their importance ?
a : well , comets are like time capsules .

the mission 's director , dr marc rayman , has himself described the images as stunning .
the bbc asked him what the new close-up pictures tell us about the nature of comets .
a : the data are so new that it 's too soon to draw conclusions , but comets previously were just very , very mysterious , and now we have enough information to start putting together the pieces of a puzzle that will tell us about the nature of comets and therefore the origin and evolution of the solar system and earth , and perhaps even life on earth .
what have we learnt about the kind of terrain , the landscape , on these objects ?
a : well , indeed , prior to ds1 's encounter with comet borrelly , we had a set of beautiful images of comet halley from the giotto spacecraft .
but they were n't clear enough actually to see any terrain on the comet , and now we can see not only terrain , but several different kinds of terrain .
there are plains , and maces , and jumbled rough areas and flat areas , and we can see areas that are producing high-velocity jets of material , and so it 's really like , literally , a whole new world to explore .
so , why have n't we had images like this before now ?
what 's been the difficulty ?
a : there are several difficulties .
one is that it 's simply very difficult to get spacecraft to comets .
they have orbits which make them difficult to reach , and they present very , very challenging and difficult environments to penetrate , and , in fact , on ds1 , i actually did not have high confidence that the spacecraft would survive its passage by the comet .
in addition , it 's only been recently that the full scientific importance of comets has begun to be appreciated , and that then has led to a renewed interest in comet missions .
so what , just to sum up , would you say is their importance ?
a : well , comets are like time capsules .
they contain remnants from the formation of the solar system .
they have the materials and the conditions of the time the solar system was formed preserved in them , and so by studying them , we can learn much more about the solar system and again life on earth - perhaps .

correspondents say president george w bush was clearly delighted when the house of representatives approved a $ 344bn defence spending bill by 398 votes to 17 .
the house agreed to shift $ 400m from the $ 8bn missile defence budget and to use it on counter-terrorism measures and waging an offensive on those behind the 11 september attacks .
the missile defence programme has been championed by president bush nearly 7,000 people are missing or dead following the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
" i am pleased that the house has taken the vital step to secure our nation 's security by passing the defence authorisation bill , " mr bush said .
mr bush is putting more than $ 6bn into anti-terrorism initiatives .
other money is being spent on improving pay and conditions for members of the us armed forces .
members of the house put aside their differences over the missile defence budget in another show of unity and support for the bush administration .
the senate also agreed last week to avoid a battle over mr bush 's missile defence plan .
it dropped a democratic-backed provision that would require congressional approval for tests that violated the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty .
the senate gave mr bush the option of spending $ 1.3bn of the missile defence budget on anti-terrorism measures .
security stepped up bob stump , an arizona republican who heads the house armed services committee , described the funds as a " down payment " on the struggle against terrorism .
in a separate development , security along the us border with canada is to be increased in the light of the attacks .
