the statement followed talks in the tajik capital dushanbe between russian president vladimir putin , his tajik counterpart emomali rahmonov and the last president of afghanistan , burhanuddin rabbani , who heads the northern alliance .
all the ethnic groups should take part in forming the next afghan government joint statement issued in dushanbe mr putin voiced strong support for the northern alliance , promising to provide military , technical and humanitarian help for what he called afghanistan 's " legitimate " government .
moscow has assisted the anti-taleban alliance for many years .
but the bbc 's monica whitlock in dushanbe says it is unusual to hear such an open statement that moscow wants a friendly government in kabul .
it appears to be at odds with what the leadership in pakistan has said it wants - and pakistan is now a key regional ally of the united states .
stronger un role the three leaders said that " all the ethnic groups should take part in forming the next afghan government " .
they called for a stronger role for the united nations " and all foreign governments " in stabilising afghanistan .
mr putin arrived in tajikistan from shanghai , where he and president george bush declared that washington and russia were building a new relationship .
our correspondent says the occasion in dushanbe was full of symbolism , with the three leaders sitting together under their respective national flags .
president rahmonov at one point referred to mr rabbani as the president of afghanistan .
they were later joined by the military leader of the northern alliance , general mohammad qassim fahim .
mr putin called him the " afghan minister of defence " - apparently not by accident .
mr putin ruled out any role for the taleban in a future government , saying they were " linked with international terrorists " .
mr rabbani was ousted by the taleban in 1996 but is still recognised as afghanistan 's president by the united nations and most states .
the northern alliance still holds a swathe of northeastern afghanistan .
about 25,000 russian troops are stationed in tajikistan to help guard its 1,200-kilometre -lrb- 750-mile -rrb- border with afghanistan .

the south korean firm saw net profit fall to 420bn won -lrb- Â£ 225m ; $ 323m -rrb- in the july to september quarter , from 1,700bn won in the three months before .
nonetheless , the results were more upbeat than those recently reported by industry peers hynix semiconductor and micron technology .
like hynix and micron , samsung has been hurt by a 90 % fall in prices for 64-megabit dynamic random access memory -lrb- dram -rrb- chips , used mainly for memory in pcs .
samsung 's four major business areas are : chips ; telecommunications ; home appliances ; and digital media , which includes pc peripherals and dvds .
not all bad quarterly sales fell to 7,230bn won from 8,800bn won in the same period last year , with semiconductor sales down 36 % from the previous quarter .
" a prolonged slump will weed out weaker chip producers and accelerate industry restructuring , which will prove positive for samsung electronics eventually , " said hanhwa securities analyst lee seong-jae .
" without cutting chip output , the company is trying to further expand its market share , while waiting for weak prices to force some other rivals to go out of business , " added mirae asset securities analyst kim kyung-mo .
samsung said its third quarter profit was helped by good performance in information-telecoms operations , which posted a 16 % rise in operating profits on the three months before .
but its digital media and home appliance recorded both reported sharp falls in operating profits .
samsung electronics shares fell 1.5 % before recovering to closed down 550 won , or 0.22 % , at 169,500 won on monday .
