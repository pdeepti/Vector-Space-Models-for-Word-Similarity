official newspapers reported their departure , but gave no reasons for the move , and did not name any successors .
all five were army officers , but not members of the 17-man state peace and development council which rules burma .
correspondents say the retirement of two deputy prime ministers -lrb- rear admiral maung maung khin and lieutenant general tin tun -rrb- had been expected .
the departure of the other three cabinet ministers- the minister for culture win sein , the minister for co-operatives aung san , and the minister for immigration saw tun , came as a surprise .
council anniversary foreign diplomats say there could be more cabinet changes in the run-up to the fourth anniversary of the creation of the peace and development council on thursday .
on saturday , the official media said lieutenant general win myint -seen as the fourth most powerful man in burma - had been dismissed from his post .
deputy prime minister tin hla , responsible for buying equipment for the armed forces , was also sacked .
no reasons for their dismissals were given , but according to afp news agency , they were both given " termination notifications " - the severest expression of official disapproval .
observers in rangoon believe that allegations of corruption against the two generals may be the cause of their dismissal .
both were heavily involved in military linked businesses , and corruption in known to be rife among the ruling elite .
the most sweeping previous reshuffle in the burmese regime came in 1997 , when four ministers were removed amid accusations of corruption .
the armed forces have governed burma since 1962 , and the current regime has been in power since 1990 , when the military rejected the results of elections won by the democratic leader aung san suu kyi .
they have been engaged in a dialogue with aung san suu kyi for more than a year , but so far there are no indications that they are considering easing their grip on power .

a deal was struck between between representatives of the musicians and the recording companies .
until now , record labels , rather than the artists and other copyright holders , have collected the money and then distributed it .
it is thought the agreement could have implications for the collection and payout of royalties to musicians in the us and britain .
groups that signed the agreement included the recording industry association of america , a recording industry trade group , and two major artists ' trade unions , the american federation of television and radio artists and the american federation of musicians .
artists ' groups the recording artists coalition , the music managers forum and the national academy of recording arts and sciences also signed .
the two sides agreed to share control equally of soundexchange , an organisation that tracks and distributes royalties from digital broadcasts .
soundexchange made its first direct payment , of $ 5.2m -lrb- £ 3.5m -rrb- , to artists and other copyright holders on 15 october .
legal minefield the growth of new media has opened up whole new areas of uncertainty in copyright law and led to some fierce legal contests .
the us music industry and internet broadcasters have called in an arbitration panel to decide on the size of web royalties for artists .
and in april , european union ministers gave their final approval to new , eu-wide copyright laws aimed at curbing internet and hi-tech piracy .
the copyright directive , as the law is known , seeks to balance the interests of the music industry , artists and consumers .
it gives copyright owners permission to use encryption to block the duplication of copyright-protected works and to limit the illegal downloading of audio and video files from the internet .
member states have 18 months to ratify and implement the directive .
