but the sv1 is among the fastest computers on earth , bearing a name that has a special place in the history of computing .
this week , the cray sv1 product line was named best supercomputer for 2001 by the readers of scientific computing & instrumentation magazine .
this is the third year in a row cray supercomputers have earned this distinction .
" because we ask our readers to vote for the technologies they use in their everyday work lives , the winners have proven their value and worth to the modern scientist , " said kim sekel , editor in chief of scientific computing & instrumentation .
weather forecasting across the world , cray supercomputers are used to tackle challenging scientific and technical problems , among them weather forecasting and climate prediction .
" when you mention cray they always say , ah yes , supercomputers , because it 's what cray have always done , they have n't built business machines like some of the other vendors have , " says sam clarke from the uk met office supercomputer centre .
the uk met office has two cray t3es to help it forecast what will happen in the skies over britain .
" there are millions of sites in this model , points at which the weather 's forecast , and that requires a lot of memory and a lot of computing power to solve the equations at each point , " says mr clarke .
unassuming inventor cray supercomputers are named after their quiet and unassuming american inventor seymour cray .
growing up , mr cray had always been fascinated with electronics and spent much of his time toying with electrical equipment of all types .
in the seventies , he pushed computing into a new realm of speed and power by quite literally inventing the supercomputer .
the cray 1 was installed at los alamos national laboratory in 1976 .
it boasted a record speed of 160 mflops -lrb- million floating operations per second -rrb- and an 8mb memory .
the revolutionary ' c ' shape increased system speed by bringing integrated circuits closer together .
to many scientists , he is the thomas edison of the supercomputing industry .
the early crays were brute force computing monsters , often with their own freon cooling systems to stop them overheating .
for decades they have been the ultimate in speed .
legend has it that steve jobs once wanted to buy one to model a new apple computer on .
on hearing this seymour cray apparently said , " funny , i am using an apple to simulate the latest cray . "
flashlight vs power station cray now has many challengers in the exclusive club of fastest and most powerful .
even so measuring your home computer against a cray is still like comparing a flashlight to a power station .
" if you think about 800 or 900 of your pc 's hooked together , that 's pretty much what you 're talking about for a cray t3e , " says mr clarke .
" when it comes to memory , it 's probably got about 2000 times as much memory as your home pc , and that 's just to accommodate the weather models . "
seymour cray himself was killed in a car crash in colorado in the us five years ago .
but he single-handedly established the supercomputer industry .
and the machines that bear his name still inspire awe among those who work with computers .

the relatives say a civil action against five men with alleged links to the real ira , is their last hope for justice .
the paramilitary group killed 29 people in the county tyrone town with a car bomb three years ago .
speaking on breakfast with frost on bbc television on sunday , sinn fein 's martin mcguinness said he wished the families well in their civil action .
" i certainly do wish the omagh victims well , my heart goes out to them and the suffering they have endured .
i think all of that shows how huge the responsibility is for us as elected leaders not to fail those people but to work to ensure the peace process succeeds and the good friday agreement is implemented in full " , he said .
relatives of the victims gathered in omagh town centre at 1506 bst on saturday , the time the bomb detonated , to formally launch their campaign .
the meeting was also used to launch a further fundraising drive , with solidarity events in belfast , dublin and london .
' deserve justice ' civil writs seeking compensation were issued at the northern ireland high court in belfast on friday .
michael gallagher , whose son aidan was among those killed , said : " we had no choice but to take this action .
the public should salute the stand that these courageous families are taking for us all omagh relatives " our families are not capable of fighting for themselves , but they deserve justice and it 's our responsibility to make sure it 's delivered . "
it is believed to be the first time a writ has been issued against a paramilitary organisation .
northern ireland secretary john reid said that , for legal reasons , he could not express support for the families ' action , but nevertheless felt a " great deal of understanding " for their position .
he insisted that the police investigation into the bombing was still continuing in the hope of bringing criminal charges .
killed and maimed the five men named in the writs are seamus mckenna , of silverbridge , newry , county down ; michael mckevitt , of blackrock , dundalk , county louth ; liam campbell , of mount pleasant , dundalk , county louth ; colm murphy , of ravensdale , dundalk , county louth and seamus daly , of culloville , near castleblaney , county monaghan .
there is also a writ against the real ira as an organisation .
no-one has been charged with the murders , but one man is currently awaiting trial in the irish republic accused of conspiracy to cause explosions .
relatives of victims say " desperation " at the lack of prosecutions had prompted them to pursue the major suspects in the civil courts .
civil cases require a lower burden of proof than criminal proceedings .
the families have been trying to raise Â£ 1m to cover the costs of the legal battle .
fund launch the omagh victims ' legal trust has raised nearly a third of its target total , including a donation of Â£ 50,000 from an anonymous donor three days ago .
jason mccue , the lawyer representing the families , said the action taken by the families was ground-breaking .
mr mccue read a statement on behalf of the families at the omagh event , in which they said they would be " making history " in their legal action .
the statement said : " the families have undertaken this brave course of action out of respect for their loves ones - nothing more , nothing less . "
it added : " the public should salute the stand that these courageous families are taking for us all .
the public should support and back these families in any way they can . "
mr mccue said the families represented a community that had " had enough of terrorism " .
" the real ira claimed responsibility for the bomb .
this action is about making it accountable . "
the real ira is also believed to be responsible for a spate of bomb attacks in london , including the ealing car bomb last week .

norfolk police said this was because the officers responsible for the cameras were re-assigned to frontline duties such as policing rural areas .
however , a police spokesman said they were nevertheless keen to reduce the number of collisions and insisted the force was still employing measures to catch speeding cars .
filming could resume if a partnership bid to launch a scheme which would allow civilians to be responsible for the cameras is successful , a police spokesman said .
there are seven permanent grey box roadside camera sites and six attached to traffic lights in the county - two of which belong to norfolk police .
a camera has to be fitted inside these devices , before they can capture speeding drivers .
rural assignments bryan edwards , public relations manager for the casualty reduction partnership , said : " police officers were looking after the cameras which were quite labour intensive .
" they have been reassigned to frontline duties like rural policing . "
officers had to set the camera up , take it out to the various sites , and deal with other administrative duties .
mr edwards said that police officers were still using hand-held speed detection cameras in the area .
he said that it was important to focus on reducing the number of collisions .
jonathan simpson , from the rac foundation , said : " speed cameras have a definite role outside schools and at accident blackspots .
" at the moment , the whole situation is turning into farce . "
