the eight-nation committee - known as the commonwealth ministerial action group - has been hearing submissions from a range of pakistani organisations on the progress being made towards a return to democratic government .
on monday , london 's elegant marlborough house teemed with pakistani politicians and activists , many of whom had come to britain specially to give the commonwealth their views .
the main parties had turned out in force , and organisations ranging from amnesty international to the commonwealth magistrates ' and judges ' association and the federation of pakistan chambers of commerce had brought submissions reflecting their own particular concerns .
now the foreign ministers will have to weigh up the evidence they have heard , and decide whether pakistan is moving fast enough towards democracy .
when the army took power 18 months ago , the commonwealth hestitated , and stopped short of a full suspension .
pakistan is currently suspended from meetings , but not from the organisation .
so there is still room for the screws to be tightened a little on general musharraf 's military government , while stopping short of the ultimate sanction - expulsion from the commonwealth .
zimbabwe fears the other main agenda item for this meeting is fiji , where the commonwealth has been pressing for the restoration of the elected government .
zimbabwe is not on the official agenda , but it is clear that many of the countries on the committee are worried about developments there .
the problem is that president mugabe 's government was properly elected , and however badly it may govern , it is not clear that the ministerial action group , under its present mandate , has any power to intervene .

this is the latest move in an increasingly bitter row between the neighbouring countries .
the countries have accused each other of harbouring and assisting dissidents prolonging a border conflict which has created the region 's refugee crisis .
the liberian government said on monday afternoon that the sierra leone ambassador kemoh salia-bao and guinea 's ambassador baba soare have seven days to leave liberia .
the two west african diplomats are accused of involvement in " acts incompatible with their status " .
no details the government press statement did not explain what exactly the two ambassadors had done to warrant their expulsion .
there has been no immediate reaction from the two embassies .
the sierra leonean envoy returned to liberia just one week ago after spending time in the sierra leonean capital , freetown , conferring with his government .
the decision to expel the two diplomats has cast doubt in monrovia about the possibility of getting the three countries of the mano river union - guinea , liberia and sierra leone - to mend fences .

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- child protection system under scrutiny low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo tuesday , 20 march , 2001 , 06:28 gmt child protection system under scrutiny jack mcconnell announces a comprehensive review the scottish executive has announced a comprehensive review of child protection systems .
education minister jack mcconnell said the review is necessary to avoid a repeat of past tragedies where children have died as a result of social work failings .
the minister highlighted the case of three-year-old dumfries girl kennedy macfarlane , who died last year after being attacked by her mother 's boyfriend .
a report into the tragedy concluded that social workers and health staff failed to prevent the child 's death despite clear warning signs that she was mistreated .
the review was prompted by kennedy 's death speaking at a conference in edinburgh on better integrated children 's services , mr mcconnell said no child should " ever fall through the protection net " because professionals failed to work closely together .
he said : " i think that the recent child protection case in dumfries and galloway gives us an example of how important joined up services can be .
" we must make sure that no child should fall through the net , particularly vulnerable children , because people are not talking to each other .
" i am determined that we will do our best to prevent a repeat of this kind of incident .
" it is vital that we do more than just talk about joined up working .
we must ensure that everyone , local government , agencies and departments , works better together locally to give the best service possible to our young people . "
the review will be carried out by top officials and was expected to be completed by the end of the year .
it follows a recommendation from the inquiry into the death of kennedy .
she was murdered in may last year by thomas duncan , her mother 's boyfriend .
warning signs the judge at his trial said kennedy 's death involved an appalling degree of violence .
the inquiry that followed concluded that she could have been saved if warning signs had been followed .
it said action should have been taken when kennedy 's nursery alerted health professionals to bruising on her cheek and an unusually sore back two months before her death .
it also said that a health professional should have intervened when the child was taken to hospital with more bruising a fortnight before the fatal attack .
