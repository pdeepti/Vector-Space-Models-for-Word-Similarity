the 23-year-old from ireland beat blonde hairdresser helen adams in a live final on friday night and emerged from the house in tears .
" i never expected to get this far , " he said .
" i 'm still coming to terms with winning and it 's such a shock . "
he said he would spend his prize on taking friends on holiday but was still planning to return to his job at ryanair next month .
" i come from a small village and i do plan to go home but i want to put my feet firmly on the ground first , " he said .
" i am irish , catholic , gay and i am chuffed that people in ireland have backed me . "
dressed in a white shirt and jeans , he strolled calmly and slowly out of the house as fireworks erupted in the sky .
brian 's family travelled from their home in rathangan , co kildare , to greet him - a major achievement for his mother rosie as she was terrified of flying and had never been in a plane before .
he said his lowest points were missing his sister and his mum and dad but he said he was " chuffed " that they were all supporting him .
clear winner he polled 4,231,660 votes -lrb- 58 % -rrb- out of a total 7,255,094 , while 2,680,463 viewers -lrb- 37 % -rrb- voted for helen .
dean o 'loughlin , from birmingham , was evicted earlier in the night after receiving 269,489 -lrb- 4 % -rrb- of the votes cast. when host davina mccall announced brian had won he jumped in the air shouting : " oh my god , i 'm going home , i 'm going home . "
brian then hugged and kissed runner-up helen before she left the big brother house barefoot , wearing a sparkling light blue off-the-shoulder dress and carrying her shoes in her hands .
on leaving the house , the 23-year-old hairdresser and dance teacher from cwmbran in wales was greeted by fellow housemate paul clarke and told him : " you look so different . "
when she was told that boyfriend big g had dumped her , she said : " that 's cool by me .
i feel fine - whatever mate .
it do n't bother me . "
she said she had feared a possible showdown between big g and paul , saying : " i was worried that paul would have two black eyes . "
paul presented her with a pair of gucci shoes and a handbag , to which she yelled : " oh my god - paul clarke , i ca n't believe it ! "
helen said of their relationship : " i am very fond of him but big brother will get back to you on that one .
" paul clarke is a really nice guy - probably the most genuine , honest guy i 've met . "
sparkly stuff talking about her future plans she said : " i can not tell at the moment as i 've just stepped out but it 's made me realise how much i miss hairdressing and teaching dance . "
she said she was looking forward to a cup of tea , a chat with her mum and just getting back to wales .
asked why she was so popular , helen replied : " is it because i wear sparkly stuff ? "
she insisted that she did n't mind losing out to brian : " i did n't think i was going to get on there and i am not disappointed .
it 's just like a dancing competition . "
the total number of votes cast in the final week of the second series of big brother was less than last year 's record breaking figure of 7.4 million .
five pence from each vote cast throughout the series goes to charity - shelter , kids company and community self-build will share £ 803,980 .
in bbc news online 's own poll , helen received 43.59 % of the votes cast and brian received 43.24 % .

deputy rural development minister rhona brankin said that the country had been clear of the disease , which devastated farms in the borders and dumfries and galloway for two months .
the results of blood tests on livestock in infected areas have proved negative , allowing the restrictions to be lifted .
more than 750,000 animals were slaughtered on 1,500 farms during the outbreak .
our disease priority remains to avoid at all costs the prospect of new infection in scotland deputy rural development minister rhona brankin ms brankin said : " it is now nearly two months since the last outbreak of foot-and-mouth in scotland and blood testing has produced negative results .
" we are therefore able to remove infected areas from almost all of dumfries and galloway .
this will come as a great relief to all those affected by the disease .
" the small remaining infected area in scotland results from restrictions in cumbria .
" blood testing in this area is progressing apace and is on target for completion towards the end of next week . "
she added : " our disease priority remains to avoid at all costs the prospect of new infection in scotland .
by doing so we will have the strongest possible case for claiming in due course that the country as a whole is free of disease . "
the only remaining restriction applies to the movement of livestock from a farm within 10km of an infected farm .
they will still not be allowed to be moved out of dumfries and galloway or the borders .
ms brankin also unveiled a european commission scheme to help farmers store the surplus of lamb caused by restrictions on meat exports until next year .
that follows a plea from farmers in shetland , who feared they would have to destroy 50,000 lambs because they could not be taken to markets .
ms brankin said : " this is good news for our hard-pressed sheep sector .
i am deeply aware of concerns about the market position for lamb this season .
" i know that those in the hill areas and the remoter parts of the country whose livelihoods are most dependent upon sheep are worried about future prospects . "

the couple are facing legal costs of at least £ 60,000 after their failed court battle to keep the children .
the twins at the centre of the tug-over-war they faces financial ruin after a long drawn out and costly legal battle to keep the babies belinda and kimberley .
the kilshaws , from buckley in north wales , voluntarily agreed to the repossession of their house by their building society during a hearing at wrexham crown court on 30 june .
the couple now have about four weeks left to vacate their home and find somewhere else to live .
having lost the twins who were returned to the united states following a high court battle , the kilshaws last week said they were still determined to adopt a baby and were prepared to move overseas to do so .
they said intend to get a girl from america and move abroad to turkey with their family .
judith kilshaw remains determined to adopt during a channel 4 fly-on-the-wall documentary broadcast earlier this week , mrs kilshaw - who has three children of her own - said they would move abroad to escape britain 's strict adoption laws .
however , stricter laws governing internet adoption and inter-country adoption are already under consideration , the department of health told bbc news online .
last month the government announced plans to crackdown on the internet adoption of children as part of the adoption and children bill .
the documentary also showed how the strain of the court battle had affected the kilshaws .
the couple were shown arguing as mrs kilshaw , 47 , told her husband at one point that she wanted a divorce , hated him and regretted their telling their story to a tabloid newspaper .

they faces financial ruin after a long drawn out and costly legal battle to keep the babies belinda and kimberley .
the kilshaws , from buckley in north wales , voluntarily agreed to the repossession of their house by their building society during a hearing at wrexham crown court on 30 june .
the couple now have about four weeks left to vacate their home and find somewhere else to live .
having lost the twins who were returned to the united states following a high court battle , the kilshaws last week said they were still determined to adopt a baby and were prepared to move overseas to do so .
they said intend to get a girl from america and move abroad to turkey with their family .
during a channel 4 fly-on-the-wall documentary broadcast earlier this week , mrs kilshaw - who has three children of her own - said they would move abroad to escape britain 's strict adoption laws .
however , stricter laws governing internet adoption and inter-country adoption are already under consideration , the department of health told bbc news online .
last month the government announced plans to crackdown on the internet adoption of children as part of the adoption and children bill .
the documentary also showed how the strain of the court battle had affected the kilshaws .
the couple were shown arguing as mrs kilshaw , 47 , told her husband at one point that she wanted a divorce , hated him and regretted their telling their story to a tabloid newspaper .

although a bad showing would not end the ruling liberal democratic party 's reign - it already holds a majority in the stronger lower house - mr koizumi needs a respectable win to push through political and economic change .

but even if mr koizumi does win strong support from the japanese public , he must still persuade his deeply conservative ldp of the advantages of change .
bbc tokyo correspondent charles scanlon says the real battle is expected to begin after the election when mr koizumi is forced to confront conservative faction leaders in his own party .
nowhere to hide mr koizumi told voters on saturday that he was ready to do battle with his own party if necessary to push through what he has dubbed " reform without sanctuary . "
the ldp leader wants to cut government spending on public works projects , force banks to rid themselves of bad loans and undo regulations which shelter inefficient industries .

but mr koizumi 's star-studded image did receive a knock on friday when the japanese media widely reported a gaffe reminiscent of his unpopular predecessor , yoshiro mori .
" even beggars can read .
they read newspapers .
even the homeless , " the press quoted mr koizumi as saying during a speech on thursday in southern kyushu island .
homeless people and their supporters gathered for an angry protest outside the prime minister 's office on friday , arguing that mr koizumi should be more sympathetic to the victims of restructuring for which he is responsible .
