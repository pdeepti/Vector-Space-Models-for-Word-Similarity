france was once the biggest seller of wine around the world , but it can no longer make that claim .
french wine makers have been ' resting on their laurels ' in 1999 , 79 million fewer bottles were exported from france than the previous year .
last year , 93 million fewer were exported .
sales of burgundy wine , in particular , fell by 30 % last year , and of beaujolais by 17 % .
the competition is coming from newer wine producers from countries like the united states , australia , new zealand and chile .
in the middle range of wines they are competitively priced , but they also have a more modern image , and some consumers think a better taste for the money .
outdated marketing the french government is now studying an official report by a french wine expert , jacques berteaux .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- q & a : why not vaccinate ?
categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 4 august , 2001 , 04:25 gmt 05:25 uk q & a : why not vaccinate ?
bbc news online 's environment correspondent alex kirby weighs the arguments for and against vaccination : what could vaccination achieve ?
some scientists say vaccination should be used to speed the end of the epidemic .
professor fred brown , who helped to tackle the 1967 outbreak , says the virus will become more active and virulent as temperatures drop with winter approaching .
sheep will be moving down from the hills to lowland pastures , and there are fears of many more cases .
but other scientists say the vaccine would not offer any advantages over mass slaughter .
what are the arguments against vaccination ?
it takes four days to work , and even then may not be completely effective .
vaccinated animals can still carry the virus and pass it on , without showing any symptoms .
there would be a marked effect on uk exports : some could continue , but british meat would be barred from the us , and vaccinated british animals could not be exported there or to japan .
total meat and livestock exports amount to about £ 310m -lrb- $ 460m -rrb- a year .
the dutch used vaccination , but many experts say the situation there was significantly different .
the outbreak was localised , and vaccination provided a ring of animals round the strongholds of the virus .
all were slaughtered later .
in the uk , the outbreak had raced across the country before anyone knew it was here , let alone begun working to eradicate it .
could people safely eat the meat of vaccinated animals and drink their milk ?
yes .
foot-and-mouth disease is not a risk to human health .
in many other countries meat and milk from vaccinated animals are routinely consumed .
the food standards agency says : " millions of doses of vaccine have been given world-wide with no adverse effects on human health .
foot-and-mouth disease vaccines are widely used throughout the developing world in parts of africa , south america and central america .
if people go abroad on holiday to countries where the vaccine is routinely used and eat meat , that meat has probably been vaccinated and has never been shown to cause any human health problems .
in mainland europe -lrb- including the netherlands , france , west germany , belgium , italy , spain and switzerland -rrb- , people were drinking milk and eating meat from animals vaccinated against the disease up until 1991 . "
the fsa told bbc news online : " there is no evidence of any consumer resistance in countries which routinely use vaccination . "
could vaccination prevent future outbreaks ?
no .
there are several strains of foot-and-mouth , and vaccines work against only one strain of the virus .
anyway , animals need booster shots every six months or so .
and the uk would not be able to regain its " foot-and-mouth free " export status while vaccination continued .
what do farmers think about vaccination ?
many are understandably confused .
early on in the outbreak the then agriculture minister , nick brown , said that using vaccination would be a " substantial retreat " .
the government has argued - largely from concern over lost export markets - that vaccination would not help .
the export trade is worth far less than the damage done to tourism and the wider rural economy .
but even critics of the government say the countryside will not recover until foot-and-mouth is beaten .
the national farmers ' union has opposed vaccination consistently .
the nfu president , ben gill , said : " these are not simply economic concerns , as some have suggested .
" there is a real possibility that the use of vaccination could actually prolong this outbreak , resulting in the culling of more cattle rather than less .
this has happened elsewhere in the world .
" once we go down this road there will be no going back .
and it is farmers throughout the uk - not just in vaccinated areas and not only cattle farmers - who will have to bear the consequences for a very long time to come . "
despite that , some farmers , and many outside the industry believe that mass slaughter was the wrong approach .
they accept that seriously ill animals should be slaughtered on humane grounds , but believe that vaccination could have spared many more .
that would have meant spotting the disease far earlier .

even now , vaccination could result in substantial savings if the disease were to continue for many months , according to the study .
the research - commissioned by bbc radio 4 's today programme - challenges the idea that the government has tackled foot-and-mouth disease in the most cost-effective way .
experts argue , but the crisis continues but the findings emerge as a computer model of strategies for controlling the outbreak suggests that the government 's mass slaughter policy is the most effective way of containing the disease .
researchers said vaccinating animals in the worst-affected areas could have helped only marginally and if it was adopted in " buffer zones " could have let the disease spiral out of control .
meanwhile , a cull of 1,300 sheep found to be carrying virus antibodies has been carried out the brecon beacons , sparking fears that the welsh national park 's entire flock will be affected .
alternative policy the research on the economic cost of the disease was carried out by professor peter midmore at the university of wales in aberystwyth .
he compared the likely economic impact under the current policy of culling all affected livestock with the alternative , of controlling the spread of the virus through vaccination .
professor midmore estimates the crisis will have cost about £ 5bn in total by the end of the year .
this includes the money spent on slaughter , compensation for farmers and the impact on tourism .
in contrast , he calculates that vaccinating animals in a ring around infected areas would have cut the total bill to between £ 1.5-2bn , even considering the likely delay in lifting an export ban on british meat and livestock .
even now , the research suggests , vaccination around infected areas could cut the continuing costs of the epidemic by about half , unless the disease is eradicated in the next few weeks .
we have been importing meat from those countries which do vaccinate over the past few years organic farmer , helen browning frits pluimers , the chief veterinary officer for holland , where they vaccinated after a foot-and-mouth outbreak earlier this year , said that once animals were immune they could be kept without risk - creating more time to manage the disease .
and organic farmer helen browning , who chairs the soil association and sits on the meat and livestock commission , believes the caution surrounding vaccination is misplaced as meat from vaccinated animals is already for sale in britain .
" we have been importing meat from those countries that do vaccinate during the past few years , " she told today .
the cull of 1,300 sheep in the brecon beacons will bring the total number of animals slaughtered to 6,500 .
test results on a further 4,000 are awaited , and some fear the disease now threatens the entire flock of 100,000 sheep in the beacons .
the cycle of testing and killing is likely to continue until officials are convinced that they have got ahead of the disease .
the national farmers ' union -lrb- wales -rrb- wants healthy animals to be put into quarantine and later used to restock the hills .
meanwhile , the department of environment and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- has announced the resumption of the disinfection scheme to rid farms in england and wales of the disease .
it had been halted by the government for a two-week review amid concerns over escalating costs .
farms were costing an average of £ 100,000 to disinfect - compared with an estimated £ 30,000 in scotland and £ 10,000 elsewhere in europe . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's andy tighe " the nfu is strongly opposed to vaccination " soil association 's helen browning " we would rather vaccinate than wholesale slaughter " full special report a year to forget outbreak 's uk impact last county recovers tourism bouncing back ?
