tesco said it was already the country 's largest organic retailer - selling £ 200m worth of produce a year - but customers wanted more .
and the supermarket chain called on british farmers to grow more organic produce so demand need not continue to be mostly met by imports .
organic farmers welcomed the news but expressed fears that aggressive supermarket buying tactics , which many conventional farmers complain about , could be used to force prices below the cost of production .
consumer concern the decision comes at a time of growing consumer concern about the impact of chemical residues on human health and the environment .
tesco said it was already cutting the prices of its organic produce .
but the announcement coincides with the publication of a government-backed code of practice aimed at stopping big supermarkets exploiting small suppliers .
the code was prepared in response to a competition commission inquiry last year .
but campaign group friends of the earth has said it is " weasel-worded " and will offer small suppliers little protection .

he met the country 's leader king abdullah to discuss the war against global terrorism and the palestinian-israeli conflict .
he will continue to israel for talks with prime minister ariel sharon , and to gaza , where he will meet palestinian leader yasser arafat .
on wednesday , mr blair was received politely in syria and saudi arabia , but both countries have deep reservations about the us-led military campaign against osama bin laden , the islamic militant suspected of masterminding last month 's terror attacks on the united states .
in syria , president bashar al-assad condemned the deaths of civilians in afghanistan and accused the israelis of terrorising the palestinians .
the bbc 's andrew marr , travelling with mr blair , says wednesday was an " intensely difficult and at times embarrassing day of shuttle diplomacy " .
in amman , mr blair is likely to hear more arab concerns about the possible impact of us-led action against afghanistan .
jordan is worried that military action may extend to neighbouring iraq and destabilise the already turbulent region .
king abdullah has said that would be " a great catastrophe " .
mr blair 's visit to the middle east comes as the us steps up its military campaign , with increased air raids on the north of the country .
moderate opinion arab and muslim disquiet over the air attacks on afghanistan , now in their fourth week , has grown as the chances of a swift conclusion to the fighting diminish . : clickable map middle east states : where they stand king abdullah has tried to put jordan at the forefront of moderate arab states behind the coalition .
but anti-us sentiment has hardened during the eruption of palestinian-israeli violence , with neighbouring jordan housing more than a million palestinian refugees .
jordanian minister of state saleh qallab said : " jordan is working and following up on the necessity to set up a palestinian state as soon as possible . "
he called for an immediate " halt to israeli attacks against the palestinian people and the withdrawal of israeli troops " from palestinian-controlled areas .
after meeting palestinian leader yasser arafat in london on 15 october , mr blair called for " a viable palestinian state , as part of a negotiated and agreed settlement that guarantees peace and security for israel " .
war criticised syria 's president assad publicly rejected what seems to have been a private attempt by mr blair to have him to rein in anti-israeli militants based in damascus .
syria is classed as a state sponsor of terrorism by the us .
damascus is the headquarters of a number of militant groups , including the popular front for the liberation of palestine , which says it killed an israeli cabinet minister two weeks ago in retaliation for the killing of its own leader .
while mr assad welcomed what he called mr blair 's respect for islam , he criticised the war in afghanistan .
" we can not accept what we see every day on our television screens , whereby hundreds of innocent civilians are dying , " mr assad said .
mr assad also took issue with the definition of terrorism , refusing to class palestinian militant groups as terrorists .
" we have made distinctions between terrorism and resistance , and insisted on the distinction between islam and terrorism , " he said .
mr blair , like us president george w bush , is keen to calm tensions between israel and the palestinians in order to discourage arab sympathy for anti-western militants .
mr blair said he did not feel snubbed or embarrassed by mr assad 's fierce denunciation of western military action in afghanistan or his insistence that the militant groups based in damascus were " freedom fighters " not terrorists .
later on wednesday , after a meeting with king fahd of saudi arabi , mr blair said he had reached an agreement to work with riyadh for a broad-based government in a reconstructed afghanistan .
" they -lrb- the saudis -rrb- are very much part of the international coalition against terrorism , " he said , adding that he was grateful for saudi support .
saudi arabia has , however , refused to allow its air bases to be used for the bombing of afghanistan .

more bad news was delivered this week by market research firm gartner dataquest , which revealed that the number of pcs shipped in western europe had fallen for the second consecutive quarter .
over the last three months , the shipments of pcs in europe fell by 11 % compared with the same period in 2000 .
the fall was blamed on large companies postponing or cancelling orders and smaller organisations deciding they did not need new computers .
no money for machines the last six months have been difficult for technology firms as the hangover from the dot.com debacle stubbornly fails to lift , and the threat of a wider recession makes customers reluctant to splash out on new hardware and software .
strong evidence for the continuing slump has been revealed by figures gathered by gartner dataquest showing that the number of pcs shipped to homes and businesses over the last three months has fallen .
pc shipments - key countries germany -15.2 % uk -12.2 % france -12.4 % italy + 10 % russia + 50.4 % the biggest fall was recorded in germany where shipments were down 15.2 % .
the only regions taking on more computers than during the same period last year were italy -lrb- up 10 % -rrb- and russia -lrb- up 50.4 % -rrb- .
the figures reveal a worrying trend .
in the second quarter of 2001 , although there was a fall in the total number of pcs shipped , businesses actually bought more than during the same period in 2000 .
this time shipments were down to both businesses and homes .
compared with the same period last year the number of pcs shipped to companies and consumers was down 4.3 % and 10.7 % respectively .
" it has got a lot worse , " said brian gammage , principal analyst at gartner dataquest .
not even xp can help the ailing technology market he said the same companies reporting lower turnover and laying off staff were the ones which would usually be ordering pcs .
the slowdown in shipments has not been felt equally by all pc makers .
gartner dataquest said that companies such as compaq , ibm and fujitsu-siemens saw shipments shrink by more than 10 % .
by contrast hewlett-packard shipped the same number of pcs as in 2000 .
dell even managed a modest increase and now ships 8.6 % of pcs in western europe .
mr gammage said the launch of xp was unlikely to stop the decline because few companies were planning to migrate to the new software in the near future .
the good news is that things have got as bad as they are going to get .
" we think growth rates have now probably hit the bottom , " said mr gammage .
growth is expected to be static during the next six months , and only pick up before the third quarter of 2002 .
by that time , said mr gammage , pc makers ' customers were expected to have completed their cost and job cutting programmes and have some cash available to spend on new hardware .
but dell vice-president simon calver painted a more positive picture .
" christmas is a key purchase occasion for consumers , " he said , " they are not as budget or infrastructure dependent as the corporates . "
he added that many large companies spent heavily before 2000 in an attempt to beat the millennium bug .
by early next year the same companies may start replacing the desktop machines they bought back in 1999 , which are now old and possibly underpowered .

when the anthrax scare first began , the cases seemed isolated , traced back to a handful of letters sent to prominent government and media offices .
now the disease has claimed an ordinary new yorker as its victim .
let 's get this in perspective - one death rudy giuliani mayor of new york kathy nguyen , who worked in the medical supply room at the manhattan eye , ear and throat hospital , died on wednesday of inhalation anthrax - the most serious form of the disease .
more than 1,110 staff , patients and visitors to the hospital have been given the antibiotic , cipro , as a precaution .
and the city - already shaken by the 11 september terror attacks and anthrax scares - seems to be holding its breath , once more wary of what may lurk around the corner .
fear of the unknown dale lewis , a nurse at the hospital , says the death of her co-worker has rammed the threat home : " until now , i 'd felt ok .
everybody 's been a little edgy but -lsb- the anthrax threat -rsb- did n't affect us directly .
i have n't changed my life - i still take the subway - but now when i 'm in an enclosed elevator , i find myself wondering if i 'm being exposed . "
it is the uncertainty which makes people jumpy .
the authorities do n't yet know how ms nguyen contracted the disease .
although possible traces of anthrax have been found on her clothes , investigators have yet to discover where she came into contact with the disease .
she lost consciousness before anyone could quiz her about her movements .
mayor rudy giuliani has sought to allay new yorkers ' fears in his typical straight-talking fashion : " let 's get this in perspective - one death . "
' we 're the guinea pigs ' when anthrax panic first took hold in the us , many americans rushed to their pharmacist in an attempt to get cipro - against the advice of health officials , who warned that taking the antibiotic unnecessarily could make it less effective should the disease spread .
the death in new york - and another suspected case of skin anthrax - has redoubled these fears .
spend any time in a pharmacy in the city , and no doubt there will be someone trying to buy cipro .
as a health professional herself , ms lewis would rather not be on the antibiotic .
" i 'm concerned about building up immunity to anthrax , " she says .
" i 'm worried that health officials are putting us on the ' big guns ' like cipro when a lower strength antibiotic like penicillin would do the job .
they 're feeling their way through this , and we 're the guinea pigs . "
thin blue line in a city already on high alert , security has been stepped up this week .
not only did the government warn of new , albeit unspecified , terror attacks , the city hosted president george w bush at a world series baseball game on tuesday .
extra police have been drafted in for the city 's halloween parade and sunday 's marathon .
the high profile of new york 's finest has set restaurant worker adam sherbell 's mind at ease .
" i work under the 59th st bridge , which is a landmark , so of course i think about the warnings of another attack , " he said .
" but the cops and the military are all around , and i 'm confident they can prevent anything else happening .
as for anthrax , i 'm not a member of the news media or a postal worker , so i 'm not worried about being exposed - yet .
" if it turns out that it 's airborne , then i 'll be worried . "

the announcement comes after an elephant at the zoo crushed a worker to death .
the animal , and the zoo 's two other female asian elephants , will be moved to london zoo 's sister enclosure , whipsnade wild animal park in bedfordshire , when facilities have been prepared for them .
jim robson , 44 , died from multiple injuries when the elephant rolled on him on 20 october .

the three elephants will move to a more open enclosure and will join a breeding bull and two pregnant elephants at whipsnade .
michael dixon , director general of the zoological society of london , said the move had been a long-term plan and was not connected to mr robson 's death .
he said : " it has been a long-standing plan to assemble all our elephants at whipsnade , a move that would significantly increase the potential of our conservation breeding programme .
' familiarisation programme ' " we have to be careful not to disturb the london or whipsnade elephants by integrating them too quickly or in a way that prejudices their welfare .
" one of our elephant keepers from whipsnade is currently helping to look after the elephants in london and will be an important part of the familiarisation programme when they reach whipsnade .
" even though the move can not take place immediately , we feel it is right to make this announcement now because of the high level of current interest following the tragic death of our colleague , jim robson .
" we will be sorry to see the elephants go - there have been elephants in london zoo since 1831 . "
the elephants at the zoo have long been a draw for thousands of the capital 's children - when they arrived in the last century visitors were allowed to ride them .
' positive step ' virginia mckenna , founder of the born free foundation , which had fought to have the animals moved to whipsnade , said she welcomed the move .
the foundation had said the animals ' pens at london zoo were cramped .
she said : " at last , a positive step towards the phasing out of elephants in city zoos .
" also , the zoo 's ambitious ideas for the breeding of elephants for conservation purposes , are , perhaps , a little unrealistic .
" it would appear that up to now , in the uk , only one or two babies have survived beyond five years . "

hunt organisations across the country say they are having to lay off staff because under current foot-and-mouth restrictions hunting is illegal .
a risk assessment of the effect of hunting on foot-and-mouth has been carried out by scientists and is currently being considered by the government .
but hunt supporters have accused the government of " sitting " on the report for more than a month as a way of trying to ban hunting " through the back door " .
' political dogma ' bob brierley , spokesman for the worcestershire hunt kennels , told bbc news online : " we have been told that the report was submitted to margaret beckett more than a month ago .
" surely the government has a responsibility to report the findings of the scientists as early as possible .
" this is just another case of the government using political dogma to delay the recommendations on hunting . "
the hunt runs from 1 november each year and mr brierley said the worcestershire kennels , at fernhill heath , near worcester , has lost 60 % of its staff since the start of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .
this , he says , has had a knock-on effect on other business used by the kennels such as blacksmiths , liveries and oil suppliers .
empty stables " we should be hunting three days a week at this time of the year - some of the other packs are hunting four or five times a week - but there are no horses in our kennels .
" there are no grooms so the stables are empty and we have not bought any feed .
" normally the blacksmith comes in one day a week with our horses so he is losing work with us and the other packs . "
he added : " people can now go out walking across any bridle path or footpath .
why are we not allowed to hunt ? "
a spokesperson for the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- said the risk assessment report was currently under consideration .
he added that it would be published by the end of november .
