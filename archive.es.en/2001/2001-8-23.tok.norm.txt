the $ 19.5bn loan was part of a $ 58bn rescue package for south korea at the height of the asian economic crisis .
president kim dae-jung said that the end of imf repayments meant that south korea will now become a lending country , with its international status and credibility boosted .
three years ago , with its economy on the verge of collapse , south korea turned to the imf for a multi-billion dollar bail-out .
painful restructuring the loan was the biggest in the imf 's history and it came with strict conditions , demanding government reform of the country 's financial sector , reforms of the family-owned industrial giants , known as chaebol , and economic liberalisation .
the decision sends the world a message that korea has now completely overcome the crisis that required the intervention of the imf and that it has fully recovered its ' economic sovereignty ' south korean government statement painful restructuring programmes were put in place .
but now the seoul government is paying the last instalment nearly three years ahead of schedule .
it should be a moment for congratulations .
imf managing-director , horst koehler , said it was a major milestone and a testimony to the korean economy 's rapid recovery and stabilisation from the 1997 financial crisis .
but the mood in south korea is more sombre .
the country is grappling with a new economic slowdown and the government 's popularity ratings continue to fall .
this week the central bank issued figures showing the country 's year-on-year growth slowed to 2.7 % in the second quarter - the lowest since early 1999 .
many economists speak of reform fatigue , despite the fact that the government 's restructuring programme is far from finished .
further reforms expected but with elections next year , few believe that further painful reforms will be pushed through by the current administration .
the sale of the bankrupt daewoo motor company to the us car giant general motors still hangs in the balance .
exports are falling , with south korean companies hard hit by the us and global slow-down .
south korea is still doing better than many of the other asian tiger economies but there is still a long way to go before it returns to pre-crisis growth levels .

the world wildlife fund says a phenomenon known as nutrient pollution is fuelling some plant species , particularly swathes of algae , to grow to the detriment of important marine life .
the group says the result is a blanket of green slime which is killing off marine habitats , affecting species such as seahorses , pipefish , bass and cuttlefish .
wwf scotland warns the pollution has implications for commercial fisheries north of the border .
the charity warns there could be a threat to scallops marine officer alistair davison said : " the recent devastation to the scallop industry through forced fishery closures as a result of concern over shellfish poisoning may be linked to high nutrient levels from fish farms .
" the increase of nutrients in the sea may have caused these toxic blooms , which have become more frequent and cover larger areas than ever before . "
wwf scotland says it is particularly concerned that the scottish executive has been slow to pick up on concerns over nitrate pollution from salmon farming on the west coast of scotland .
mr davidson added : " the sea on the west coast is much more diverse , sensitive and vulnerable to pollution than elsewhere in scotland . "
the group claims that fish farming on the west and north coasts of scotland is responsible for releasing the same levels of phosphorous as the annual sewage of 9.4m people .
the warning is sounded in a report produced by the group called out of sight , out of mind .
nutrient pollution is said to be to blame the main sources of nutrients are agriculture , sewage , aquaculture and industry discharges , according to the report .
wwf says the government has failed to recognise the scale of nutrient pollution in the uk or to stick to its international commitments .
as a result , important marine areas are being jeopardised with their wildlife being endangered and lost .
the report outlines what it says are inconsistencies in government policy , treating freshwater and marine environments as separate by recognising the serious threat to freshwater habitats but not to the problem in estuaries and the marine environment .

second-quarter gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- was the same as in the first quarter , and only 1 % up on the same period of 2000 .
the figure had been widely anticipated , and was heralded last week by a forecast from the bundesbank .
and although gloomy , the zero-growth figure was better than had been feared by some , after a swathe of depressing economic data throughout the summer .
cautious optimism most analysts were relatively cheered by the gdp number .
" the figure that strikes me most is private consumption which shows a 0.9 % increase quarter on quarter , " said christoph hausen , an economist at commerzbank .
" we are more confident that there will be more tax reform effect in the second half of this year .
in addition we have a lower inflation rate , which will give another boost to purchasing power and thus private consumption . "
the finance ministry was cautiously upbeat .
the figures " show without a doubt the risks of the economy have not receded , " the ministry said in a statement .
" at the same time there are chances that the forces of growth will gain the upper hand in the course of this year .
" we expect that the economy - alongside slowing inflation pressure - will gradually gain pace . "
slowing , not slumping the german economy , europe 's largest , has slowed this year .
although the government is still officially sticking to its forecast of 2 % gdp growth in 2001 , chancellor gerhard schroeder has said the eventual figure could be lower .
he is keen to stimulate the economy - and especially to boost employment - ahead of next year 's elections .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- putting the ball in the net categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 23 august , 2001 , 07:09 gmt 08:09 uk putting the ball in the net arsenal reportedly considering charging £ 13 per quarter by bbc news online technology correspondent mark ward premiership football clubs will soon be broadcasting entire league games on websites and via their own tv channels .
top clubs such as liverpool and middlesbrough are taking advantage of new rules governing the re-broadcast of premier league games to give fans greater access to match footage .
the domestic web audience for the broadcasts is likely to be small , but many fans overseas do have access to broadband net connections and are eager to watch matches they would otherwise only read about .
but the ambitions of the top clubs may come to nothing as a study shows that most of their websites are sluggish , and take far too long to serve up basic information let alone video streams .
football focus this year sees a big change to the rights premier league football clubs have to tv footage of their matches .
before now the broadcast rights have rested solely with tv companies .
" the rights to show matches that the clubs are involved in revert to the club after an exclusive period of time , " said a spokesman for the fa premier league .
celtic one of the first to put its matches on the web for games that take place on saturday or sunday the exclusive period runs out at midnight on the following monday .
for games on week nights the exclusive period expires at midnight the same day .
the change has led to many of the 20 premier league clubs signing deals to start rebroadcasting entire games or highlights via their own websites .
the few clubs that run their own tv channels , such as middlesbrough , chelsea and manchester united could soon be reshowing games shortly after they were first aired .
before now football clubs have been limited to showing post-match and archive material on websites , now many are planning to use the footage to cash in on their fans ' almost insatiable desire to see their team in action .
paying and playing arsenal are reportedly planning to charge £ 13 per quarter to view goals , highlights and key footage .
charges for similar schemes by manchester united and liverpool have yet to be revealed .
a spokesman for middlesbrough fc , which has run its own tv channel with the help of ntl since 1998 , said it will levy a small charge every month to give fans access to six hours of programming every night which will include league matches , interviews , and other exclusive material .
liverpool 's michael owen lifts the uefa cup this week liverpool unveiled a deal with web broadcasting company servecast to develop material for up to seven channels showing matches , audio and video news interviews , premiership specials and access to archive material from the last 40 years .
eoin brophy from servecast said the uk audience for high quality video broadcasts via the web is small , but there are many other countries where many more fans have access to highspeed connections .
he said many of top british clubs have huge overseas followings and broadcasting via the web is a good way of reaching these far-flung fans .
" if you live in asia or japan and do not have access to tv coverage this is great because its completely location and time independent , " he said .
almost 30,000 overseas fans tuned in to a recent webcast of a liverpool friendly match said mr brophy .
in may celtic , another servecast signing , became the first british club to broadcast tv quality footage of a game across the internet .
the match was the tommy boyd testimonial against manchester united .
response times response times derby county - 343.8 seconds arsenal - 45.3 seconds middlesbrough - 33.9 seconds manchester united - 12.2 seconds liverpool - 11.9 seconds chelsea - 1.1 seconds but even before top clubs start experimenting with video broadcasts many have much more to do to get basic information to their fans .
a study carried out over the first weekend of the premiership season by net testing company segue systems revealed that only three of the websites of the 20 premier league teams managed to serve up information in a reasonable time .
research has established that consumers will wait up to eight seconds for a website to appear onscreen once they have typed the address into their browser .
any longer and they give up and go elsewhere .
segue queried the sites every 10 minutes to see how well they were coping with the peaks and troughs of traffic over the opening weekend .
only the pages of ipswich , chelsea and sunderland had finished loading in under eight seconds .
most of the rest took far longer , and derby county took a shocking six minutes to appear .

women buy more books than men and the publishing world is falling over itself to sell them what 's become known as " chick-lit " .
but a literary row is brewing .
the novelist beryl bainbridge has dismissed chick-lit as " a waste of time , this froth sort of thing " .
beryl bainbridge is one of the most influential writers of her generation , and is favourite to win this year 's booker prize .
on friday she will be speaking at the edinburgh book festival , discussing her new novel according to queeney , about the last years of dr johnson .
she despairs of literary dumbing down .
" as people spend so little time reading it 's a pity they perhaps ca n't read something a bit deeper , a bit more profound , something with a bit of bite to it , " she says .
the writer and feminist icon doris lessing agrees .
and she can not understand why women want to write what she calls instantly forgettable , poor literature .
" it 's a pity that so many young women are trying to write that , " she says .
" i wonder if they 're just writing like this because they think they 're going to get published ?
" it would be better perhaps if they wrote books about their lives as they really saw them , and not these helpless girls , drunk and worrying about their weight . "
the godmother of the genre is arguably helen fielding , who created bridget jones 's diary - about a single girl 's struggles with sex and slimming .
it has sold more than 1.5 million copies .
it 's all the muck in the middle i mind - i hate anything that 's middle brow jeanette winterson helen fielding thinks critics of bridget jones have missed the point : the book is not meant to be taken seriously .
" it 's good for women to be able to be funny about women and not to be afraid to be funny , " she says .
" sometimes i 've had people getting their knickers in a twist about bridget jones being a disgrace to feminism and so on .
" but the point is , it 's good to be able to represent women as they actually are in the age you 're living when you 're a writer . "
but if bridget jones , and the hundreds of pale imitiations she has spawned , merely hold a mirror up to women 's lives , they will never expand horizons or stretch intellects in the way serious literary fiction can .
surprisingly perhaps , the writer and feminist jeannette winterson , does not think that matters .
" look , i 'm unashamedly high art , there is such a thing and we need it in our lives , " she says .
" but i also like entertainment .
i have no problem with chick lit , i love bridget jones 's diary , it 's just great .
" it 's all the muck in the middle i mind .
i hate anything that 's middle brow .
let 's have art or let 's have entertainment . "
and pat barker , a former winner of the booker prize says that type of entertainment is just a phase - ultimately it is something readers should grow out of .
" i think chick lit and lad lit are to do with age , " she says .
" i think young people , because they have an insecure sense of their own identity love reading books which confirm that identity , which mirror their lifestyle choices back to them .
" i think as people get older they need that from their reading less and less - most of us end up much broader-minded about what it is we 're prepared to read . "

the german composer began writing the overture to an opera based on shakespeare 's macbeth in 1810 - but it was abandoned and left unperformed .
but a dutch composer and computer programmer has pieced together parts from collections across europe to create the eight-minute piece .
it was very exciting when the piece sprang together for the first time willem holsbergen it will be performed for the first time by the national symphony orchestra on 20 september .
" the opportunity to give the world premiere of a beethoven composition - even a small portion of it - is astonishing , " said national symphony orchestra music director leonard slatkin .
" aside from the intrinsic interest in anything beethoven wrote , the story of how this performing version came to exist would probably be viewed as too far-fetched if it were to appear in fiction . "
ludwig van beethoven began writing the overture with austrian librettist joachim von collin - but abandoned the work when von collin pulled out , complaining the music was " too gloomy " .
slatkin : opportunity is " astonishing " sketches of the overture were broken up by souvenir hunters after beethoven 's death in 1827 , and ended up in bonn , berlin and london .
dutchman willem holsbergen decided to let the work see the light of day after hearing of its existence from another fan on a website .
holsbergen typed notes from the sketches into a special computer programme , which helped him stitch the three parts of the work together .
" it was very exciting when the piece sprang together for the first time , when it came to life , " holsbergen said .
' great honour ' the work is " pretty dark music most of the time " , holsbergen said , but there are " points of light in it as you would expect from beethoven " .
it had not been difficult to put the pieces together , he said , and described it as " great fun and a great honour " to construct the work .
the overture was intended to accompany the first part of the macbeth story , where the three witches are talking .
holsbergen 's score will use two flutes , two oboes , two clarinets , two bassoons , four horns , two trumpets , timpani and strings .

the winner should be known on 12 september as their battle for the votes of the conservative party membership hots up , bbc news online looks at major players who have so far declared for kenneth clarke or iain duncan smith to be next party leader .
backers for ken clarke former tory prime minister john major : " i think ken clarke is the best option for ensuring that we win elections . "
shadow home secretary ann widdecombe signed a statement saying : " ken is the leader labour most fear " .
former conservative deputy prime minister lord -lrb- michael -rrb- heseltine : " unquestionably ken clarke is the man " to help tories win back power .
sir clive thompson , chief executive of rentokil and former cbi president : mr clarke is " not a single issue " candidate .
chris patten , former hong kong governor , called for a " moderate " voice to take the party back to the middle ground .
conservative vice-chairman steve norris : " ken can help the tories present a much more intelligent position on europe . "
former foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind : " without wishing to ignore the difficulties , i am convinced that kenneth clarke is , by far , the right person . "
other supporters include former agriculture minister john gummer ; former party chairman sir norman fowler ; former foreign secretary douglas hurd ; former armed forces minister nicholas soames : former health secretary stephen dorrell ; former education and employment secretary gillian shephard ; former transport secretary sir george young ; former treasury minister john maples ; shadow northern ireland secretary andrew mackay ; mp and political journalist boris johnson .
backers for iain duncan smith former prime minister lady thatcher : iain duncan smith would restore the tories ' " faith and fortunes " , while ken clarke would be a " disaster " .
departing party leader william hague : " i fear the alternative to his election would be for our party to slide back into the divisions over europe we have done so much to move away from . "
michael ancram , who was eliminated from the leadership contest : " i believe him to be the candidate who can best unite our party , who can best reassert our core conservative principles and who is best likely to deliver the changes which can create the springboard to victory at the next election . "
shadow health secretary liam fox , along with fellow mps david heathcoat-amory and oliver letwin , wrote a letter to the times supporting mr duncan smith " because of his opposition to the euro and the extension of the powers of brussels " .
stalwart of the tory right lord tebbit : mr duncan smith is " a remarkably normal family man with children " .
former home secretary michael howard : " he should not be underestimated " .
mp for wokingham john redwood , who stood for party leadership in 1995 and 1997 : iain duncan smith because he is " opposing more european government . "
