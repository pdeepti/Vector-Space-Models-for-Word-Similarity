what will ariel sharon do next ?
he is under pressure from two fronts .
he has to form a government within 45 days or face early presidential and parliamentary elections .
he must also deal with an escalation of violence in the palestinian territories .
this unrest struck at the heart of israel on wednesday with a bus attack on a group of soldiers and civilians .
mr sharon has dispatched envoys to washington to present his stance on a potential resumption of negotiations with the palestinians .
he says palestinian leader yasser arafat must act to stop violence if talks are to resume .
sharon 's peace line jerusalem will remain undivided no peace talks as long as violence persists no more west bank land - of which the palestinians control 42 % - will be transferred ehud barak will remain prime minister in a caretaker role until a new government is formed .
who are his allies ?
mainly the right wing , religious and russian immigrant parties .
these include israel 's prominent ultra-orthodox party shas , which propped up mr barak 's minority government but often clashed with secular cabinet colleagues .
however , these parties do n't command a majority in the knesset , israel 's parliament .
what are his options ?
mr sharon is conducting talks with the opposition labour party in an attempt to form a national unity coalition .
this would give the government its best chance of surviving the rest of the knesset 's term , which ends in 2003 .
if this fails , he could form a narrow right-wing and religious coalition , which would only have a small majority in parliament .
where does this leave the labour party ?
a unity government may cause divisions within the ranks of labour .
mr barak 's decision to refuse the offer of the post of minister of defence and resign from his party may make coalition talks between likud and labour easier .
mr barak 's image among his own party colleagues is severely tarnished .
it has already been reported that the party was planning to exclude mr barak from its list of suggested ministers when it votes on whether or not to join the government .
a number of senior labour politicians , such as yossi beilin , have said they will not join a coalition .
but shimon peres , a contender to replace mr barak at the head of the party and the architect of the oslo peace accords , favours a unity government .
one possible route into a national unity government for labour would be to hand the leadership to shimon peres temporarily , until a new party leader is elected .
what next for the peace process ?
although the israeli public voted in protest against mr barak 's handling of negotiations with the palestinians , they did not explicitly vote against the peace process .
mr sharon 's campaign promises included bringing both security and peace , but he insists he will not talk to the palestinians until their uprising - or intifada - ends .
palestinian groups , however , insist the violence will continue .
he has , however , reached broad outlines with labour about how to proceed with the peace process if a national unity government is formed .
the draft document talks of honouring previous peace agreements reached with the palestinians provided they were ratified by parliament .
there is no mention of an eventual palestinian state , but no new jewish settlements will be established in the west bank and gaza strip .

a survey by the marine conservation society has found beaches are generally getting cleaner , but the amount of plastic rubbish is causing particular concern .
nearly 1,400 volunteers collected rubbish from 150 beaches around the uk for this latest snapshot of the state of our seashores , called beachwatch 2000 .
the total volume of litter has fallen for two years running , but the society says the amount of plastic deposited on beaches is a major concern .
protecting the environment nearly 10,000 small plastic items were found , many of them industrial pellets which fish and seabirds can mistake for food , putting themselves at risk of being poisoned by chemicals which attach themselves to the plastic .
beach visitors are the largest source of rubbish , but the litter also comes from fishing boats , cargo ships and items such as cotton buds flushed down the toilet .
the director of conservation at the marine conservation society , sam pollard , said : " we are pleased to see that the levels of litter have decreased for a second consecutive year and we hope that this trend continues .
" but we as individuals must safeguard the environment and wildlife by taking care with our litter . "
among the litter picked up in this survey were a fridge door , a number 49 lottery ball , and a shampoo sachet dating from before the introduction of decimal coinage 30 years ago .

the deal includes a pledge to fund community-reading schemes , as requested by potter author jk rowling , and is thought to be one of the largest ever marketing link-ups with a film .
coca cola will fund community reading initiatives under the terms of the deal the face of the young wizard will not be shown on cans or bottles of coca-cola but " harry potter-related images " will appear .

it also stars john cleese , alan rickman , robbie coltrane , dame maggie smith and zoe wanamaker and is due to be released on 16 november .
a spokesman for coca-cola said : " this is going to be about the harry potter ethos as opposed to a buy-one-get-one-free type of thing . "
" it was tremendously important that we create a partnership that would have the ability to globally support the power and magic of harry potter , " brad ball , president of domestic marketing at warner brothers said .
' one on one ' " the key to our plan will be about relationships , local communities , connecting with people one-on-one and looking at the things we traditionally do in a whole new way , " said tom long , coca-cola 's uk division president .
the marketing deal will see coke ditch traditional marketing strategies for films such as giveaways at fast food outlets .
filming on the potter movie has run behind schedule and film bosses have had to ask school authorities for permission to keep daniel radcliffe , who will play the young wizard , out of school for longer than was planned .
radcliffe and his young co-stars emma watson , 10 , and rupert grint , 12 , have been receiving lessons from tutors while on set .

for years , the traditional diamond and lion motif of pringle of scotland was associated with golf enthusiasts rather than trend-setters .
but the brand is now more likely to be sported by robbie williams and david beckham than the likes of nick faldo .
we are really working with all the right retailers that have the right environment to promote luxurious brands kim winser , pringle that is all part of the company 's efforts to rebrand itself as a " high fashion " product .
the sale of pringle to hong kong-based fang brothers knitting ltd in a £ 10m deal last february led to 140 job losses at its hawick and galashiels factories .
but the workforce at the hawick plant is expanding for the first time in years as it stages its comeback .
kim winser is the woman responsible for turning around the brand .
" we have walked away from over 100 retailers in the last year that we did not feel represented the new vision for the brand , " she explained .
job losses " we are really working with all the right retailers that have the right environment to promote luxurious brands .
" we have definitely moved to being a more luxurious business . "
that strategy is also being followed by other companies within the scottish textile industry , which has been ravaged by job cuts in recent years .
in the four years to 1999 , there were 6000 textile jobs lost in scotland .
the textile industry has faced job cuts and scottish enterprise borders chief executive jim mcfarlane said firms could no longer to make hundreds and hundreds of the same garment .
" it is important that our companies understand the competitive pressures that they are facing , " he said .
" they operate in high value markets where price is not the determining factor .
" they are offering an absolute specialism that is not available elsewhere . "
he said cashmere was the largest employer in the textile industry .
royal visit " the whole emphasis of the work we have been doing with that sector has been to move more of them into high value , high fashion areas so that scottish cashmere has a cachet in much the same way as swiss watches and french champagne . "
the princess royal will be in the borders on wednesday to see at first hand how pringle has been transformed since it was sold by dawson international .
during her visit , she will open a new learning centre which is intended to improve the skills of the company 's 250 employees .

the controversy began when the national academy of recording arts and sciences nominated the 28-year-old for four grammys .
gay and women 's rights groups immediately protested although gay singer sir elton john , who will duet with eminem at the los angeles ceremony , has defended the rapper .
now lynne cheney , wife of us vice-president dick cheney , has joined the attacks on eminem .
insult she told cnn : " elton john has been so good in the past speaking out on issues of equality for gay people , on issues of being against violent language against gay people .
" i am quite amazed and dismayed that he would choose to perform with eminem . "
she added : " this is a man who talks about murdering his own mother , he talks about murdering women generally .
" he talks about killing them slowly so you can hear them scream for a long time . "
prominent los angeles gay activist robin tyler said john 's decision was " an insult to every lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender person and every woman who has suffered violence " .
" i do n't care if elton john kisses eminem , " he added .
" it would be like barbara streisand kissing -lsb- hitler 's mistress -rsb- eva braun . "
activists complain that eminem 's grammy-nominated album , the marshall mathers lp , which has sold 10 million copies worldwide , contains 18 uses of the word " faggot " .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- connolly wins web name battle low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : entertainment front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 21 february , 2001 , 10:56 gmt connolly wins web name battle connolly : domain name victory scottish comedian and actor billy connolly has won control of the internet domain name billyconnolly.com from a golden labrador stud dog and its owner .
dogs have as much of a right to advertise their services on the world wide web as banjo-playing ex-shipyard welders mr stewart 's website statement the comedian and actor was awarded ownership of the web address -lrb- url -rrb- after he complained against its registered owner anthony stewart to the un 's world intellectual property organisation -lrb- wipo -rrb- in geneva .
mr stewart , of gourock in scotland , claimed he had a right to register the site to advertise the mating services of his dog rougemar billyconnolly .
however , the wipo agreed with the comedian that he had common law rights to a name established over a 30-year career .
rougemar billyconnolly : at the centre of the row it also ruled that mr stewart had intended to " tarnish and damage " that name .
' bad faith ' connolly , 58 , claimed mr stewart originally offered to hand over the domain name in return for a five-year supply of his tickety-boo tea and a press announcement about the agreement .
connolly said that mr stewart rejected an offer of £ 202.80 - the commercial cost of the tea bags .
connolly also claimed he offered mr stewart £ 750 for the name , but that stewart upped the price to £ 7,500 , plus legal expenses .
julia roberts was a web name winner a message on the dog 's website claimed to have as much right to the site as the comedian .
" i know it 's a dog 's life but is there no justice in this world ? , " it read .
" dogs have as much of a right to advertise their services on the world wide web as banjo-playing ex-shipyard welders , " it said , referring to the glaswegian comedian 's early working years in his hometown .
however , wipo panellist david perkins rejected mr stewart 's right of ownership .
he dismissed the claim that the website could be named for the dog , especially as the dog had been called rougemar pindar to begin with .
mr perkins also ruled that stewart was using the name in bad faith and was in the business of buying and selling celebrity domain names .
anyone can register a domain name for a few dollars , which has led so-called " cybersquatters " registering famous names in order to sell them back for a large sum .
connolly is the latest of a number of celebrities from around the world who have taken similar action over the use of their name on the internet .
hollywood actress julia roberts and pop star madonna are two who , like connolly , have won their cases .
others such as the singer sting , however , have been overruled .
