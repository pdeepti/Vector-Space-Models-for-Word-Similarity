" holloway is not being treated any differently to any other establishment , in fact it is being treated more favourably in some respects . "
anger management mr clifford said that recruiting nurses for the prison 's health centre was a problem and that Â£ 40,000 a month was being spent on agency personnel .
inmate gillian bryant , who was convicted of robbing a petrol station , said : " they definitely need new doctors .

she said that with the help of staff she had gained qualifications and certificates in several subjects including anger management and assertiveness .

industrial production figures , too , proved disappointing , with a rise in output well short of expectations as companies continued to run down their inventories .
the data demonstrates that well before the economic shock administered by the attacks on the us , japan was already in dire straits .
" the figures show how severe economic conditions were before 11 september , and it is difficult to assess how much shock the events since then have caused to the economy , " said heizo takenaka , the country 's economics minister .
no more jobs for life for the fifth month in a row the number of people out of work in japan climbed , with august 2001 showing a 260,000 rise over the year before .
the total of 3.36m is now over 5 % of the workforce .
to make matters worse , the number of jobs on offer is shrinking , with august 's figure of 583,510 down 3.6 % year on year .
seasonally adjusted figures for august show 59 jobs for every hundred applicants , down from 60 in july .
debt crisis and with bad debts still crippling corporate japan , economists say things are certain to get worse before they get better .
the banks alone have bad debts estimated at about 150trn yen -lrb- $ 1,250bn -rrb- , over 30 % of gross domestic product .
the government has still to announce exactly how it will tackle the problem , and has launched a private sector experts ' panel to advise on the issue .
but whatever happens , prime minister junichiro koizumi 's promise to sort out the issue - which has depressed japan for a decade - within three years will mean hundreds of thousands more job losses .
consumer gloom , industrial stagnation the rest of the economic news was little better .
industrial production in august rose 0.8 % month on month , but the rise fell well short of the consensus forecast by economists of 2.8-3 % .
september 's figures are forecast by the ministry of finance to drop 1.9 % .
" the results were extremely poor , " said shinichi sato , who manages investment strategy at tokyo mitsubishi securities .
comparing this august with a year ago , he said , production had fallen 11.7 % .
" a year-on-year fall of more than 10 % had happened only once before in the last 20 years , which was in 1998 . "
and japanese consumers are still staying away from the shops , according to the wage earners ' households ' spending survey .
august 's figure showed a 0.8 % drop in real terms from the year before , to 326,938 yen -lrb- $ 2,733 -rrb- - again a five-month straight decline .
intervention continues the government is trying to help export businesses by intervening in the money markets seven times in two weeks .
the move has seen the yen drop back towards a rate of 120 to the dollar , having nudged higher earlier in the week .
the finance minister , masajuro shiokawa , refused to rule out further activism .
" given the state of the current economy , which is in a recessionary phase , and given the problem of prices , i have been thinking that a weaker yen would be favourable , " he said .
negative outlook the figures offer a bleak confirmation of the gloomy outlook presented earlier in september by the government 's quarterly economic report .
the report , prepared before the attack on new york and washington dc , warns that the global slowdown means more pain ahead .
" the economy continues to deteriorate , " the report said , in words almost unchanged from the last survey three months earlier .
" the outlook presents worrisome factors , such as a further slowdown in the global economy and the high level of the inventories-to-shipments ratio . "

the monument was dismantled after storms destroyed the roadside at torcross , south devon , where thousands of us troops trained in secret for the d-day landings in 1944 .
now villagers say they want it restored .
devon county council says finding a new site has proved difficult .
the elderly people , the older grandads and grandmas whose life was the village , who never left it , for them it was traumatic villager the monument was given by the american forces in 1954 to thank people who were forced out of eight villages around slapton sands .
in order to keep the invasion plans secret 3,500 people moved out just before christmas 1943 .
they were given just six weeks to leave , with no explanation .
the monument was donated in 1954 - but two flagpoles and a plinth are all that currently stands on the site .
village ' insult ' in january 2001 , storms tore apart the coast road at torcross .
council officials moved it because of fears that it would be lost .
but it has remained in the corner of a car-park at a council waste depot ever since .
people say it is an insult to villagers , and the americans who presented it .
storms made the roads collapse one said : " the elderly people , the older grandads and grandmas whose life was the village , who never left it , for them it was traumatic .
" there were heart attacks , premature deaths and suicides - those who could n't face coming back to the homes they were forced out of for nearly a year .
" apart from the farmers , they received no compensation . "
devon county council says finding a new site for the monument has been a drawn-out process .
spokesman david andrew said : " it has taken longer than the county council expected , but be very clear - it is going back . "

arnolfini will take over bush house in 2003 a design team will begin work to convert the three lower floors .

the announcement came hours after un secretary-general kofi annan called for the international community to provide $ 584m for the projected needs of up to 7.5m afghans over the next six months .
the international community must do more to help not only with the immediate refugee situation but also to ensure that poor and vulnerable communities in pakistan are adequately protected clare short international development secretary clare short said : " pakistan has hosted refugees for many years through a period of conflict and , more recently , drought .
" the current crisis is placing new pressures on an already difficult economic situation .
" the international community must do more to help not only with the immediate refugee situation but also to ensure that poor and vulnerable communities in pakistan are adequately protected . "
the extra money will be targeted mainly at supporting public health services , including the supply of drugs , health equipment , water and sanitation .
ms short told bbc one 's breakfast programme that she wanted to see the borders between afghanistan and pakistan and iran to be open , but added that those countries would need more international help to cope with the millions of afghan refugees .
there was a need for " equal weight and leadership " to be given to tackling the humanitarian crisis as there was to tackling the terrorists .
escaping kabul on thursday prime minister tony blair urged the international community to form a " humanitarian coalition " to help ordinary afghans caught up in the crisis .
he said : " our fight is not with islam or with the people of afghanistan .
our fight is with those who planned these terrible atrocities and those who harbour them . "
estimates suggest there are already 2.2m afghan refugees in pakistan , and a further 1m are expected to arrive in the next few weeks .
there are reports of chaos inside afghanistan as people rush to escape the capital , kabul , and other areas they believe might be a target for a us-led military response to the 11 september terrorist attacks .
pakistan has closed its borders to new afghan refugees , saying it can not cope with any more .
but refugee minister abbas sarfraz khan said the authorities would consider reopening the border if there was a humanitarian crisis .
long-term plan afghans are also fleeing a food crisis caused by aid workers being pulled out of afghanistan , amid fears of us and uk reprisals against the ruling taleban regime for harbouring prime suspect osama bin laden .
an estimated one in four afghans was dependent on aid before the attacks .
ms short said measures to get food into the country were being discussed " as a matter of urgency " .
ms short said the uk 's aid strategy in pakistan was meant to help in both the short and long term .
she said : " the uk has been helping pakistan and iran with the costs of refugees for many years .
" the strain is increasing and we are therefore increasing our effort .
it is important that the refugees are well cared for but we also provide support to poor pakistanis otherwise tensions grow between locals and refugees .
" recovering from this current crisis will take time - the uk is firmly committed to working with pakistan for the long term to reduce poverty . "
the aid package brings the total amount given to pakistan by the uk since the atrocities to Â£ 36m , and is in addition to the current Â£ 15m annual programme for poverty reduction there .
the assistance will focus mainly on the most affected areas - north west frontier province and balochistan , which are closest to afghanistan .

according to the environment agency , welsh water is the second most prosecuted water and sewage business in wales and england .
each year , agency officials report on the performance of businesses in wales and england .
in investigating welsh water , it emerged that the utility company had been prosecuted ten times and fined Â£ 27,000 .
while welsh water was criticised in the report , seven other welsh businesses were praised for their environmental performance .
four of these seven firms are located in barry , south wales , including dow corning , zeon chemicals and borden chemicals , all of which form part of the barry chemical complex .
meanwhile , bp chemicals at baglan bay near port talbot was singled out after reducing sulphur dioxide emissions by 80 % .
in response to the report 's findings the agency is now calling on welsh water to evaluate its pollution-control methods to prevent future problems .
there is no room for complacency .
businesses must understand they have a responsibility to protect the environment .
roger thomas , director of environment agency wales on one occasion last year the company was fined Â£ 5,000 for discharging sewage into a stream next to a children 's playing field , which left a trail of faeces and paper according to a consumer magazine investigation .
although the environment agency had already asked welsh water to repair the pumping station that was causing the problem , which ? magazine said the company had failed to act .
but a spokesman for welsh water said : " which ? misleads its readers by presenting a totally one-sided view .
" it ignores the vast amount of work we have done to clean up the environment resulting in record numbers of blue flag beaches and the best quality river water in england and wales .
" we operate a vast network , and there have been several incidents which we , of course , regret .
" maintaining our reputation as an environmentally responsible company is what motivates us . "
overall the agency says current regulations are having an impact and welsh companies are far more aware of the consequences of polluting .
however environmental campaigners argue that they should be tighter still .
roger thomas , director of environment agency wales , said : " there is no room for complacency .
" businesses must understand they have a responsibility to protect the environment and we will continue to take a tough line against those who are environmentally irresponsible " .
