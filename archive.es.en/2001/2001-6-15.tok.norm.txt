angus msp andrew welsh is visiting the plant to meet management following the company 's decision to sell off the site as part of a uk-wide rationalisation .

the majority of the job losses will go in england , where three sites will be closed .
andrew welsh : " need to ensure factory 's future " despite plans to sell off the montrose site , which employs 720 staff , management said they were upbeat about the factory 's future .
they said that whoever bought the site would be awarded a full contract of work to supply glaxosmithkline with eight of their products .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- paris set for air show low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 15 june , 2001 , 07:21 gmt 08:21 uk paris set for air show boeing is under pressure to explain how the sonic cruiser will fly the biannual paris air show kicks off on 16 june and as is traditional , it will provide companies the chance to boast about orders , lambast each others planes , show off the latest designs and sell a few weapons systems .
hundreds of planes are on display at le bourget airport the rivalry between airbus and boeing will probably dominate the eight day show at le bourget outside paris , just as it does as its sister show in farnborough .
but there are also plenty of side shows including the expected launch of the politically-fuelled airbus a400m military transport , the return to the skies of the world 's largest plane and a possible announcement of the future of concorde .
paris is the most important air show this year and provides aerospace companies the chance to showcase their products to customers , investors and the public .
boeing v airbus paris is the chance for boeing to provide more details about its high-speed ' sonic cruiser ' and prove its critics wrong .
last year airbus proved it could take the a380 super jumbo from the drawing board to commercial reality at farnborough .
boeing had derided airbus ' a380 saying there was no market for a plane of its size .
airbus secured enough orders to launch the a380 earlier this year , boeing said it would offer up the radically designed ' sonic cruiser ' as a high-speed alternative .
the plane is designed to fly just below the speed of sound , not as fast as concorde , and will cut an hour off the regular flight time between london and new york .
but sceptics claim the figures do not add up and doubt the cruiser will ever get off the ground .
they have calculated that the amount of fuel it will need to travel at just below the speed of sound , the size of the plane and the number of passengers does not equal lift-off .
boasting orders boeing and airbus , in which the european aeronautic defence and space -lrb- eads -rrb- and bae systems are shareholders , are expected to again announce massive aircraft orders .
but analysts warn the levels this year will not match previous air shows , as falling profits and fears of over the global economic slowdown has made airlines more cautious .
both boeing and airbus have healthy order backlogs , which will help offset the effects of a possible slowdown this year .
orders are expected to be strong in the regional and executive jet market , which is considered the hot spot of the industry .
all major manufacturers such as bombardier , embraer , fairchild dornier and bae systems , are expected to debut new aircraft models and announce new orders .
military manoeuvres the future of the airbus a400m is likely to take centre stage in the military aviation arena .
the future of the a400m rests in german hands eight countries have signed up to receive the plan , including the uk .
however , germany , which is making defence cuts , may not deliver the big order needed to get the plane in the air .
german chancellor gerhard schroeder has said he hopes to sign a deal at the air show but it is unlikely to be for the original 73 planes at a cost of $ 8.7bn.

the rivalry between airbus and boeing will probably dominate the eight day show at le bourget outside paris , just as it does as its sister show in farnborough .
but there are also plenty of side shows including the expected launch of the politically-fuelled airbus a400m military transport , the return to the skies of the world 's largest plane and a possible announcement of the future of concorde .
paris is the most important air show this year and provides aerospace companies the chance to showcase their products to customers , investors and the public .
boeing v airbus paris is the chance for boeing to provide more details about its high-speed ' sonic cruiser ' and prove its critics wrong .
last year airbus proved it could take the a380 super jumbo from the drawing board to commercial reality at farnborough .
boeing had derided airbus ' a380 saying there was no market for a plane of its size .
earlier this year , boeing said it would offer up the radically designed ' sonic cruiser ' as a high-speed alternative .
the plane is designed to fly just below the speed of sound , not as fast as concorde , and will cut an hour off the regular flight time between london and new york .
but sceptics claim the figures do not add up and doubt the cruiser will ever get off the ground .
they have calculated that the amount of fuel it will need to travel at just below the speed of sound , the size of the plane and the number of passengers does not equal lift-off .
boasting orders boeing and airbus , in which the european aeronautic defence and space -lrb- eads -rrb- and bae systems are shareholders , are expected to again announce massive aircraft orders .
but analysts warn the levels this year will not match previous air shows , as falling profits and fears of over the global economic slowdown has made airlines more cautious .
both boeing and airbus have healthy order backlogs , which will help offset the effects of a possible slowdown this year .
orders are expected to be strong in the regional and executive jet market , which is considered the hot spot of the industry .
all major manufacturers such as bombardier , embraer , fairchild dornier and bae systems , are expected to debut new aircraft models and announce new orders .
military manoeuvres the future of the airbus a400m is likely to take centre stage in the military aviation arena .
eight countries have signed up to receive the plan , including the uk .
however , germany , which is making defence cuts , may not deliver the big order needed to get the plane in the air .
german chancellor gerhard schroeder has said he hopes to sign a deal at the air show but it is unlikely to be for the original 73 planes at a cost of $ 8.7bn.
the total order from european countries was expected to be for 223 a400ms worth about $ 26.6bn to airbus .
the big birds another announcement that will be closely watch will be on the return of concorde after the accident last july when one of air france 's supersonic jets crashed after take-off from paris killing 113 people .

the planned mini-series will combine mcveigh 's story with those of heroes and victims of the 1995 bombing , in which 168 people died .
producers say the series will be similar to traffic it will be based on the book american terrorist : timothy mcveigh and the oklahoma city bombing , written by lou michel and dan herbeck after 75 hours of interviews with the bomber .
a cbs spokesman confirmed its plans with bbc news online , saying : " we have optioned the book on mcveigh and it is in development at cbs . "
mcveigh was killed by lethal injection on monday , the first execution by the federal government in almost 40 years .
producer gerry abrams told variety magazine that the series would not just be about mcveigh , but also about the others affected by the bombing of the alfred p murrah federal building .
" when i read the book , i was left feeling that because so much attention had been devoted to mcveigh , that the public was unaware of so many individual acts of heroism from people involved , " he said .
168 people died in the 1995 bombing it will have a similar feel to the film traffic , which starred catherine zeta-jones and michael douglas , he said .
" the mini-series we want to make will follow the template of traffic , where seemingly unrelated people are involved in a common crisis . "
the heroes include the policeman who arrested mcveigh an hour after the bombing for the minor offence of not having a registration plate on his car .
he was 20 minutes from releasing him when he made the connection to the oklahoma atrocity .
mr abrams said the last thing he wanted to do was to " further mcveigh 's legacy " .
but the story of mcveigh 's transition from an all-american boy to a mass-terrorist will be covered .
mcveigh 's attack was the worst-ever peacetime attack on us soil , leaving more than 800 people injured .

mechanised beach cleaning has been criticised for removing ecologically important seaweed as well as rubbish .
seaweed often removed by mechanised beach cleaning is an important food resourse for small creatures which in turn are eaten by birds .
in swansea , they have returned to a low-tech solution - human litter pickers .
the positive aim of the clean ups is to create blue flag award winners , with welsh recipients of the european benchmark due to receive their awards on friday in porthcawl .
the resort is one of south wales 's most popular seaside destinations .
millions of pounds have been spent making welsh beaches the rival of the best in europe .
the keep wales tidy group - which administers the blue flag awards in wales - has said a balance should be struck between the needs of wildlife and beach users .
tough standards earlier this month , five welsh beaches have lost the prestigious blue flag award , given for clean water and good environmental management .
but 18 sites around wales 's coastline still meet the tough european standards - including penmaenmawr in conwy , north wales , which has achieved blue flag status for the first time .
marinas are also included in the survey , and like beaches , the number of welsh sites achieving blue flag status has dropped from seven to four .
blue flag awards are given by the tidy britain group to resort beaches that meet european commision guidelines on water quality and environmental management .
both aberystwyth north and borth in ceredigion failed to retain the status they won last year .
but local environmental managers say they are not disturbed by the news as both areas suffered exceptional problems with flooding at the time the testing was carried out .
and they say considerable work has been done to remedy the condition of the beaches since the blue flag tests were carried out .
dog-walkers environmental campaigners believe that the foot-and-mouth crisis may also have had an impact on the cleanliness of the coastline .
with large stretches of land marked off-limits , it is thought many people have been turning to beaches to walk their dogs .
the tidy britain group are encouraging dog owners to exercise their pets away from resort beaches .
earlier this year , research revealed that beaches in wales are the most litter-strewn in the uk .
a marine conservation society study also shows that wales has the biggest amount of fishing and shipping debris .

for a start , where was the melody ?
in fact , there had been antecedents : the radical black verse of the last poets , the almost tuneless heavy funk of james brown , and jamaican " toasting " -lrb- spoken lyrics over reggae rhythms -rrb- .
james brown 's rhythm 's were a huge influence all of the above had seeped into the consciousness of a young new yorker who called himself kool herc , who during the 1970s began reciting rhymes over the instrumental parts of the records he was spinning .
' scratching ' with two turntables going and two copies of each record he could play the break over and over while he rapped .
many feel kool herc was the true originator of rap .
grandmaster flash 's adventures on the wheels of steel in 1981 added a new element - the exhilarating collage effect of " scratching " different records together to create a new whole .
with disco and rock 's new wave starting to sound tired , rap 's directness and apparent street authenticity were invigorating .
like punk before it , rap polarised music fans - but even its proponents would not have predicted that rap would become a 20 year-old fixture on the music scene .
mythology this year , rap even overtook country music as americas ' second favourite style - after rock .
like other styles of pop music , rap had its own dances - breakdancing and bodypopping - its own clothes , and its own mythology .
the mythology of rap became increasingly important , repelling and attracting fans in equal measure .
rap was proud of its origins in the black ghettos of north america , and spoke of poverty , police brutality and defiance .
it also , some said , celebrated a violent machismo and mindless materialism .
certainly , once the first wave of rap artists had come and gone - including afrika bambaataa , run dmc and roxanne - the was a something of a lyrical vacuum in which " gangsta " rap found it easy to get attention .
nihilism it was on the west coast of the us in the late 1980s - far away from rap 's origins in new york - that gangsta rap took hold , notably in the work of ice-t and the group niggas with attitude .
coolio : gangsta rap with a conscience as if in response to such nihilism , the group public enemy promoted a serious black separatist political agenda - to find themselves with a huge number of white european fans .
at the same time , de la soul expressed a wry , witty side of rap which many fans found much more user-friendly .
but rap 's bad image would not go away - or could not , given the behaviour of some rap artists .
in september 1996 snoop doggy dogg was acquitted on a murder charge , just before another rapper , tupac shakur was murdered in a shooting .
in 1997 rap label boss suge knight was sentenced to nine years in prison for a range of offences , and in march of that year the notorious big -lrb- aka biggie smalls -rrb- was murdered .
more positively , rap was becoming a medium for the world 's youth to express themselves , not only in anglophone countries but in france -lrb- notably with mc solaar -rrb- , germany -lrb- rammstein -rrb- , finland -lrb- bomfunk mcs -rrb- , japan -lrb- muro -rrb- and the czech republic -lrb- chaozz -rrb- .
established even communist cuba was not immune : the orishas , based in paris , took their brand of salsa rap to havana earlier this year .
towards the end of the century rap was clearly established as a force in its own right , no longer a sub-section of black music or dance music .
at the same time it was also noticeable that the lines between rap and other forms of pop music were becoming blurred - who could say where , exactly , rap stopped and rnb or dancehall began ?
the music had also matured to the point where a white rapper , eminem , could combine authenticity with crossover appeal and become one of the world 's major music stars .
the protégée of producer dr dre , eminem has aroused just the same shock and controversy that rap artists have always done in the last two decades .
congress but there are now serious shadows on rap 's horizon .
members of the us congress are talking about legislation to penalise record companies who market obscene records to minors .
and opposition to the imagery of violence and misogyny that characterises at least some rap has widened to include black organisations like the national political congress of black women .
so it is a sober atmosphere in which this week 's hip hop summit has taken place .
and it is not surprising that some speakers have used words rarely heard in the rap world - words like " responsibility " .
it remains to be seen whether fine words at the summit are heard where rap and hip hop are actually made - on the street .

nihilism it was on the west coast of the us in the late 1980s - far away from rap 's origins in new york - that gangsta rap took hold , notably in the work of ice-t and the group niggas with attitude .
as if in response to such nihilism , the group public enemy promoted a serious black separatist political agenda - to find themselves with a huge number of white european fans .
at the same time , de la soul expressed a wry , witty side of rap which many fans found much more user-friendly .
but rap 's bad image would not go away - or could not , given the behaviour of some rap artists .
in september 1996 snoop doggy dogg was acquitted on a murder charge , just before another rapper , tupac shakur was murdered in a shooting .
in 1997 rap label boss suge knight was sentenced to nine years in prison for a range of offences , and in march of that year the notorious big -lrb- aka biggie smalls -rrb- was murdered .
more positively , rap was becoming a medium for the world 's youth to express themselves , not only in anglophone countries but in france -lrb- notably with mc solaar -rrb- , germany -lrb- rammstein -rrb- , finland -lrb- bomfunk mcs -rrb- , japan -lrb- muro -rrb- and the czech republic -lrb- chaozz -rrb- .
established even communist cuba was not immune : the orishas , based in paris , took their brand of salsa rap to havana earlier this year .
towards the end of the century rap was clearly established as a force in its own right , no longer a sub-section of black music or dance music .
at the same time it was also noticeable that the lines between rap and other forms of pop music were becoming blurred - who could say where , exactly , rap stopped and rnb or dancehall began ?
the music had also matured to the point where a white rapper , eminem , could combine authenticity with crossover appeal and become one of the world 's major music stars .
the protégée of producer dr dre , eminem has aroused just the same shock and controversy that rap artists have always done in the last two decades .
congress but there are now serious shadows on rap 's horizon .
members of the us congress are talking about legislation to penalise record companies who market obscene records to minors .
and opposition to the imagery of violence and misogyny that characterises at least some rap has widened to include black organisations like the national political congress of black women .
so it is a sober atmosphere in which this week 's hip hop summit has taken place .
and it is not surprising that some speakers have used words rarely heard in the rap world - words like " responsibility " .
it remains to be seen whether fine words at the summit are heard where rap and hip hop are actually made - on the street .

but those at the summit vowed to protect rap artists ' freedom of speech by fighting us congressional efforts to censor the music .
hip hop is more powerful than any american cultural movement we 've ever had russell simmons , def jam records the three-day summit , which brought together more than 200 rappers , industry executives and black politicians , has tried to clean up the music 's image and stop its sometimes murderous fueds .
the summit also had a political agenda , pushing for a stronger relationship between the industry and the national association for the advancement of colored people -lrb- naacp -rrb- , the southern christian leadership conference , the million family movement , the nation of islam and rap the vote .
power hip hop is big business : americans spent nearly $ 2bn -lrb- £ 1.42bn -rrb- on rap music last year .
russell simmons , one of its leading impresarios , said it was time that performers recognised their power .
" hip hop is more powerful than any american cultural movement we 've ever had , " he said .
" the success that they 've created and the industry that they built and the influence that they have - i 'm hopeful that they 'll take more responsibility about whatever it is that they do . "
louis farrakhan of the nation of islam was one of the political activists who attended the summit , telling rappers : " you 've now got to accept the responsibility you 've never accepted .
" you are the leaders of the youth of the world . "
code one of the intentions of the summit was to co-ordinate the diverse political agendas of the music .
besides pushing for greater co-operation with existing black political organisations , there was a call for the formation of " hip hop think tanks " with the initial think tank at columbia university , new york .
but many american parents will be most interested in the voluntary code which appears to have been reached on how to market albums .
in a move welcomed by hilary rosen , president of the recording industry association of america -lrb- riaa -rrb- , those present agreed on a uniform standard for the " parental advisory " label .
the standard states that labels should be plainly displayed - and be unable to be removed - on the cover art for all necessary albums at one set size .
this also applies to all advertisements including the products , including online advertising .
leading rap label def jam also unveiled what it called its " hip hop mentoring programme " , which would attempt to help with the career development of rap artists who sometimes lead chaotic personal and professional lives .
rapper and producer sean combs - also known as " puff daddy " - spoke of his satisfaction at the agreements reached .
" i am very proud , so proud to be a part of this summit , " he said .
" the things i have seen in the last three days have touched me in such a positive way and i think it gave me true representation to what hip hop is and what hip hop is about . "

the latest trend is the introduction of in-flight internet access , a technology that was tentatively launched earlier this year , but which now looks likely to become ubiquitous .
on 13 june , us aircraft manufacturer boeing , together with airlines delta , united and american , unveiled connexion , a project to roll out online services on 1,500 of their planes by the middle of next year .
one day later , airbus , boeing 's european rival , announced a joint venture with tenzing , an in-flight web access provider .
tenzing has already signed up a handful of carriers , including virgin atlantic and singapore airlines , to run trials of its service .
new revenue streams although connexion and tenzing use different wireless techniques to get online data onboard , both will offer passengers a pretty full range of web access and e-mail services-for a price .
the real luxury is getting there quickly daniel solon of aviation consultancy avmark an hour 's online time on connexion , for example , will cost the passenger around $ 20 -lrb- £ 14 -rrb- , which will be shared between the airline and the service provider .
according to the most optimistic estimates , the in-flight internet services market could be worth as much as $ 50bn over the next ten years .
margins under pressure airlines would love to get a piece of that action : aviation statistics conflict hugely , but most point to a sharp slowdown in profits from traditional economy-class passengers , as tourists increasingly opt for budget airlines such as ireland 's ryanair and go , owned by british airways -lrb- ba -rrb- .
pierre jeanniot , director general of the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , told an industry conference earlier this year that , despite a brisk 6.8 % annual increase in passenger traffic in 2001 , profits per passenger were on course to fall for the second year in succession .
the overall net profit of iata members , which include almost all major airlines , could be just $ 1.5bn this year , down from $ 2.4bn in 1999 , jeanniot said .
coming soon in business class adding perks like internet access will help airlines cash in on the more lucrative business-travel and first-class market , analysts say .
" the average business-class passenger is worth ten times as much as one in economy class , so the airlines plainly need to cater for them " says morten herholdt , an analyst at barclays stockbrokers in london .
a host of airlines are getting in on the act : virgin atlantic is examining plans to launch a business-class-only airline , jetset , to serve a number of transatlantic routes .
ba , which introduced the first flat beds last year , is spending £ 200m to install them throughout its network .
concorde , which looked certain to be scrapped after its crash in paris last july , is being reintroduced this year jointly by ba and air france .
most major carriers are investing heavily in business-class facilities , including expanding passenger space , and bolting on perks such as effortless check-in , in-flight massage and chauffeur-driven cars to and from the airport .
time is money however , many companies are reining in the corporate expense accounts that pay for almost every business-class and first-class seat : a recent survey by the association of corporate travel executives found that budgets are being trimmed by around 6-10 % this year .
but some observers reckon that careful business-class investments will pay off .
busy executives may not care much about chauffeurs and vintage champagne , says daniel solon , of aviation consultancy avmark , but they are still willing to pay high fares in order to save time by working or sleeping on the move .
" the real luxury is getting there quickly on something like concorde , " says mr solon .
" and what really counts is sleep . "
quality in-flight time and while the airline business is increasingly polarised between cheap-and-cheerful airlines on the one hand , and the luxury flat beds of ba club class on the other , the once-massive middle market is in danger of being squeezed out of existence .
" economy class passengers pay plenty of money for their tickets , but are wedged in , fed bad food and herded around like cattle , " says mr solon .
" they are the real victims . "

concorde , which looked certain to be scrapped after its crash in paris last july , is being reintroduced this year jointly by ba and air france .
most major carriers are investing heavily in business-class facilities , including expanding passenger space , and bolting on perks such as effortless check-in , in-flight massage and chauffeur-driven cars to and from the airport .
time is money however , many companies are reining in the corporate expense accounts that pay for almost every business-class and first-class seat : a recent survey by the association of corporate travel executives found that budgets are being trimmed by around 6-10 % this year .
but some observers reckon that careful business-class investments will pay off .
busy executives may not care much about chauffeurs and vintage champagne , says daniel solon , of aviation consultancy avmark , but they are still willing to pay high fares in order to save time by working or sleeping on the move .
" the real luxury is getting there quickly on something like concorde , " says mr solon .
" and what really counts is sleep . "
and while the airline business is increasingly polarised between cheap-and-cheerful airlines on the one hand , and the luxury flat beds of ba club class on the other , the once-massive middle market is in danger of being squeezed out of existence .
" economy class passengers pay plenty of money for their tickets , but are wedged in , fed bad food and herded around like cattle , " says mr solon .
" they are the real victims . "

none of the 36 passengers and crew on the glasgow to leeds-bradford airport flight were injured but many said it was a terrifying experience .
all of a sudden a bolt of lightning hit the right wing - there was a large bang and a flash deborah stephens passenger six fire crews were waiting for the plane as it landed at leeds-bradford airport just before 1700bst on thursday .
it is believed the pilot realised the lightning strike meant he would not be able to control the steering of the plane when it landed .
distress call a west yorkshire fire service spokeswoman said : " we had reports of a large aircraft in distress . "
" there was believed to be some problem with the hydraulics - i think it was the lightning which caused that . "
passenger deborah stephens , 31 , a pr accounts director from leeds , said it was terrifying .
" it was a normal flight until the descent and all of a sudden a bolt of lightning hit the right wing , " she said .
" there was a large bang and a flash . "
