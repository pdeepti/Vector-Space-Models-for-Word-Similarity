e-mail services from personal computers failed to reach handsets for 18 hours because of a technical problem at a server .
a further software glitch has meant that the much-vaunted videophones will not be available for at least another month .
japan 's leading mobile phone firm , ntt docomo , hopes to roll out a full service from october onwards , having already pushed back the launch date by six months .
third-generation mobile phones promise users fast and " always on " access to the internet , e-mail and video streams .
depending on network capacity , they can be up to 40 times faster than current mobile phones .
gadget fans eager for 3g during the trial , there will be no more than 3,300 users at first , and the service will only be available in tokyo and some districts of neighbouring yokohama and kawasaki .
more than 147,000 people applied to take part in the 3g trial , but just 3,330 were chosen to test the handsets .
despite the spate of technical problems , first impressions were favourable .
" it 's great , it 's so fast " , said shintaro yanagisawa , a 24-year old employee of a marketing company .
and docomo 's president , keiji tachikawa , was bullish about 3g 's prospects : " this system turns a new page in mobile communications of the 21st century . "
docomo has dubbed the new service " foma " , or freedom of mobile multimedia access .
free handsets participants in the trial were given the handsets for free , but have to pay a fee for the amount of data they send or receive .
three minutes of data transmission will cost them between 100 and 150 yen -lrb- $ 0.83-1.25 , £ 0.60-0.88 -rrb- .
but while the test phones are free , the real thing will cost consumers dearly .
i-mode phones , the japanese predecessor of 3g , cost about 30,000 yen -lrb- $ 250 , £ 175 -rrb- , and 3g handsets are expected to be more expensive .
one of the testers , yoshihiro fujita , thinks the new phones are " cool " , but is sceptical whether he would fork out extra for a 3g phone .
unfreeze that phone docomo hopes the trial will help it to purge the complex system of software and hardware bugs .
users have been warned that the technology is not quite there yet .
the screens of the 3g phones on trial are likely to freeze , for example , and " re-booting " the phone by switching it off and on again is the only remedy .
the network itself is limited as well .
so far , the telecoms ministry has not yet guaranteed the technical quality of the 3g service , which in japan is a precondition for running a commercial network .
the full roll-out of 3g services will only cover tokyo , other centres such as osaka and nagoya may have access in december .
a nationwide service could come in about a year 's time .
i-mode money spinner docomo hopes to repeat the success of its i-mode service , a high-speed , always-on phone service that has set benchmarks for the global telecoms industry .
in just a few years , i-mode has gained 23 million subscribers , and its usability has beaten rival systems such as the wap services available in europe hands-down .
with japanese mobile phone users furiously emailing each other , swapping pictures , reading horoscopes and playing games , i-mode earned docomo more than $ 3bn in one year alone .
the company , however , is cautious in its estimates for 3g uptake .
it expects not more than 150,000 people to subscribe to the service during the first year , although one reason for the slow roll-out will be the scarcity of 3g handsets .

nkosi johnson , who collapsed with aids-related brain damage in december , had been praised by nelson mandela as an icon in the struggle against hiv / aids .
a johnson family spokesman said that nkosi died after a desperate final battle against the disease .
nkosi will be remembered for a speech he made at the world aids conference in durban last july .
" you ca n't get aids by hugging , kissing , holding hands .
we are normal human beings , we can walk , we can talk , " he told delegates .
nkosi was born with hiv and was the longest surviving child born with the virus in the country .
his mother has since died of aids , and he was adopted when he was two by a foster mother , gail johnson .
speaking before his death ms johnson said : " we chatted about death ...
he had strong feelings about letting me down , " she said .
" i told him i would miss him and no one could take his place . "

residents and businesses are paying the price for a crisis which stems from the deregulation of the state 's electricity industry .
attempts to change the way people here are supplied with electricity have gone horribly wrong .
for months , california 's 34 million residents have lived with sudden rolling blackouts .
if that was not bad enough , they have now been told their bills are about to rise dramatically .
hi-tech heaven turned hell it would be embarrassing enough if this was the third world , but it is arguably the most technologically advanced place on earth , home to silicon valley - the birthplace of the new economy .
the state has had to step in to guarantee power some high-tech companies have already indicated they are considering moving elsewhere .
the problems stem from the deregulation of the energy supply industry five years ago , when power companies were prevented by law from passing price increases onto the consumer .
as demand soared , so did wholesale prices , and it was not long before the utilities went bankrupt and the state was forced to bail them out .
officials are predicting at least another 30 days of blackouts this summer .
without power to supply fans and air conditioners , this looks like being a long and extremely hot californian summer .
