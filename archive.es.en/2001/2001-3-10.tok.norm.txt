the court held that the woman , ana margarita martinez , had been used as an unwilling pawn by her ex-husband , juan pablo roque , and that as a consequence , their sexual relations constituted rape .
i feel ... it has been confirmed that what the cuban government did and what juan pablo roque did was a crime ana margarita martinez the couple met at a church in 1995 , shortly after mr roque arrived in miami from cuba claiming political asylum .
he had swum to the us navy base in guantanamo bay , cuba , and said he was a disillusioned air force major .
mrs martinez 's lawyers argued that he used the marriage as a cover to pursue his spying activities for the cuban government .
return to cuba several months after their wedding , he abruptly returned to havana and appeared on national television , denouncing what he said were the " terrorist activities " of cuban exiles in south florida .
the cuban government did not send representatives to the trial , nor has it confirmed that mr roque was a spy .
miami-dade circuit judge alan postman accepted mrs martinez 's argument that mr roque 's sexual relations with her were part of the deception , and that every time they had sex it therefore constituted rape .
he ordered the cuban government to pay her $ 175,000 a year for 41 years in compensation for pain and suffering .
mrs martinez said the betrayal had caused her severe emotional and physical trauma .
" i feel much better , " reuters news agency quoted her as saying after the award was announced .
" i feel that in a court of law it has been confirmed that what the cuban government did and what juan pablo roque did was a crime . "
mrs martinez 's lawyers said they would try to collect the money from cuban government assets frozen by the us authorities .
spy ring mr roque was among 14 people accused in a us indictment of operating a cuban spy ring that sought to destabilise miami 's cuban exile community .
five defendants are currently on trial in miami on the charges .
they were arrested in 1998 in florida , and are alleged to have belonged to the biggest ever cuban spy ring in the united states .
in february , the us government authorised the transfer of $ 90m in frozen cuban assets to compensate the families of three volunteer pilots from the cuban exile community .
the slain pilots were members of brothers to the rescue , a group that searches for cuban refugees at sea .

the shuttle is delivering a three-person relief crew and carrying out yet more construction work on the evolving platform .
the docking took place about 380km -lrb- 235 miles -rrb- above the south pacific at 0638gmt , about an hour behind schedule .
the delay occurred because one of the space station 's two giant electricity-producing solar wings would not lock into place after being repositioned for the docking .
the international space station viewed from the shuttle until the problem was fixed , discovery had to sit at least 120 metres -lrb- 400 feet -rrb- from the station for fear that its thrusters might damage the fragile wing if it was loose .
but after repeatedly opening and closing the latches , flight controllers managed to lock the wing and discovery was cleared to dock .
the new iss crew , referred to as expedition two , includes two americans , susan helms and james voss , and their russian commander yury usachev .
they are taking over from expedition one - american bill shepherd and russians yuri gidzenko and sergei krikalev - who have been living on the platform for nearly five months .
two spacewalks outside the iss will be performed during the course of the discovery mission , as astronauts work to equip a recently installed us research laboratory called destiny .
the leonardo multi-purpose logistics module , an aluminium canister loaded with almost five tonnes of equipment , systems and science racks for transfer to destiny , will be attached to the iss early next week .
other work will prepare way for the april installation of a giant robotic arm on the platform .

today 's mps , whether they be the fresh-faced labour class of ' 97 or the more care-worn conservative fortysomethings , have yet to prove themselves in the cut-and-thrust of the commons chamber .
to be sure , both the conservative leader william hague and the fiery socialist dennis skinner are counted among a select group of those with the power to light up the house with their oratorical skills .
but westminster currently lacks any of the real greats : the nye bevans , churchills , michael foots or , dare one say , enoch powells who are all now part of history .
soon tony benn , with his innate connection to a socialist tradition rooted in dissenting ideologies as diverse as methodism , marx and the levellers , will join them .
benn 's links to the labour movement run deep .
he was born in 1925 at 40 millbank , westminster .
his next-door neighbours were sidney and beatrice webb , who wrote clause iv of the labour party constitution , the commitment to nationalisation once at the party 's very soul .
with supreme historical irony , the same spot is now occupied by millbank tower , the headquarters and nerve-centre of a new labour party which has seemingly rejected everything tony benn and the webbs stood for , including clause iv .
name change tony benn 's life story has been well documented : born as anthony neil wedgwood-benn , the son of viscount stansgate , westminster school and oxford , bbc producer and mp at 25 .
following his father 's death in 1960 , tony benn fought a long , hard , and ultimately victorious , battle to relinquish his peerage and remain an mp .
he was a cabinet minister under harold wilson , who commented waspishly that benn " immatured with age " .
he has remained one of the country 's highest profile politicians for two generations .
an infinitely polite and courteous man who always argues about issues and not personalities , tony benn has been hailed as a messiah by the left while being vilified by the right as the most dangerous man in britain .
strange , then , that this living symbol of the parliamentary ideal has decided to leave the commons to , as he cuttingly puts it , " spend more time with politics " .
globalisation " i 'll be 76 on election day , " he adds , " and i realise that there 's a lot of work to be done outside parliament .
" the big question today is ' will globalisation allow democracy to survive ? '
on one side we have the multinationals , the international monetary fund and the european union .
i want to help to redress the balance on the other side . "

" the system is becoming american " and voters are losing their power to choose .
his critics of whom , as ever , there are many , say that tony benn is a first-class conspiracy theorist , looking for villains who just do not exist .

as tony benn prepares to leave the commons , he still has great hopes for the future .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- unlocking the brain 's potential low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo saturday , 10 march , 2001 , 08:31 gmt unlocking the brain 's potential dustin hoffman and real life savant stephen wiltshire scientists think they have identified the part of the brain , which if switched off , can stimulate artistic genius , a bbc documentary shows .
the discovery was made after studying people with autism and dementia , but an australian scientist believes ordinary people may one day be able to " tap in " and allow them at least a moment of genius .
and in recent tests , five volunteers found their abilities were improved after the particular area of the brain was temporarily " switched off " .
fragments of genius explores the amazing talents of people like stephen wiltshire , an autistic man who has an incredible ability to draw buildings in specific and accurate detail after seeing them just once in the 1988 film rain man , dustin hoffman portrayed raymond , an autistic savant with brilliant maths skills .
front temporal lobe is the key area , says a scientist both stephen and derek paravicini , an autistic man who is a superb jazz pianist , are savants - people with profound intellectual disabilities who have a " fragment of genius " - of whom there are thought to be no more than 25 in the world .
experts have been unable to explain why people have these talents .
but now two scientists have identified an area of the brain which they think may hold the key .
dr bruce miller , a dementia specialist at the university of california in san francisco , found some of his patients were developing artistic talents .
after scanning them , he found they had all had problems in the same part of the brain - the left arterial temporal lobe .
he found the same part of the brain was damaged in an american savant , dane bottino , an 11-year-old with artistic talents .
allan snyder , professor of science at the australian national university , university of sydney and director of centre for the mind , has also been looking at why savants have such amazing talents , when they are so severely disabled in other ways .
he says that everyone may be able to tap into the area of the brain that gives savants these abilities .
his theory is that because a specific part of the brain does not work properly , abilities in another area may be unlocked .
brain malfunction and he says the savants have their gifts , because of this " malfunction " of the brain , not in spite of it .
snyder : everyone has the potential to be an artistic genius he said savants were able to access certain parts of the brain most people could not .
" they are exceptional in that they can tap in and somehow we ca n't .
they have privileged access . "
and he said if ordinary people could also find a way to get access : " each of us could draw like a professional , do lightning fast arithmetic . "
this malfunctioning may , he believes , enable them to access certain " primitive " parts of the brain which process sound , vision and numbers .
in the bbc programme , stephen wiltshire is taken up in a helicopter over london .

the discovery was made after studying people with autism and dementia , but an australian scientist believes ordinary people may one day be able to " tap in " and allow them at least a moment of genius .
and in recent tests , five volunteers found their abilities were improved after the particular area of the brain was temporarily " switched off " .
fragments of genius explores the amazing talents of people like stephen wiltshire , an autistic man who has an incredible ability to draw buildings in specific and accurate detail after seeing them just once in the 1988 film rain man , dustin hoffman portrayed raymond , an autistic savant with brilliant maths skills .
both stephen and derek paravicini , an autistic man who is a superb jazz pianist , are savants - people with profound intellectual disabilities who have a " fragment of genius " - of whom there are thought to be no more than 25 in the world .
experts have been unable to explain why people have these talents .
but now two scientists have identified an area of the brain which they think may hold the key .
dr bruce miller , a dementia specialist at the university of california in san francisco , found some of his patients were developing artistic talents .
after scanning them , he found they had all had problems in the same part of the brain - the left arterial temporal lobe .
he found the same part of the brain was damaged in an american savant , dane bottino , an 11-year-old with artistic talents .
allan snyder , professor of science at the australian national university , university of sydney and director of centre for the mind , has also been looking at why savants have such amazing talents , when they are so severely disabled in other ways .
he says that everyone may be able to tap into the area of the brain that gives savants these abilities .
his theory is that because a specific part of the brain does not work properly , abilities in another area may be unlocked .
brain malfunction and he says the savants have their gifts , because of this " malfunction " of the brain , not in spite of it .
he said savants were able to access certain parts of the brain most people could not .
" they are exceptional in that they can tap in and somehow we ca n't .
they have privileged access . "
and he said if ordinary people could also find a way to get access : " each of us could draw like a professional , do lightning fast arithmetic . "
this malfunctioning may , he believes , enable them to access certain " primitive " parts of the brain which process sound , vision and numbers .
in the bbc programme , stephen wiltshire is taken up in a helicopter over london .
hours later , he produces a detailed and accurate drawing of a four-square mile area of the city .
the scientists believe this is possible because instead of his brain processing details of information , such as identifying a building or recognising it , he can tune in to all the complex mental processes that lie behind that recognition , and copy them .
a team from flinders university in adelaide , australia , recently used the findings of miller and snyder to run their own tests which found " savant skills " - memory , maths and art - improved in five out of 17 volunteers , supporting professor snyder 's theory .

the recording industry association of america was due to send the list to napster electronically on friday night .
you will still be able to share music that we have n't been asked to block napster statement napster has three working days to block access to the songs , under the terms of an injunction issued earlier this week by a us judge .
but late on friday , a napster spokeswoman said the company had not yet received the list of songs from the riaa .
the record companies are seeking to shut napster down , accusing it of facilitating copyright infringement .
the list , compiled from music owned by the big five record labels , arranges the songs by artist name , song title and album name .
it also includes the names under which the songs are stored .
staying alive napster has said it has already received some notices about copyrighted music but is determined to stay alive .
" you will still be able to share music that we have n't been asked to block , " it said in a statement .
" the napster file-sharing service is and will continue to be up and running . "
it is not clear how many files have already been blocked , but a wide range of files still remain available .
napster , set up in 1999 , makes it easy for people to locate and trade songs stored as computer files in the mp3 format , which compresses digital recordings without much sacrifice of quality .
napster does not store music files on its servers .
instead , the servers contain the names of songs and where to find the music among its users ' hard drives .
but the five largest record labels - sony , warner , bmg , emi and universal - say napster enables over 60 million fans to swap songs for free , thus robbing them of billions in profits .

tavish scott , deputy parliament minister and liberal democrat msp , resigned from the scottish executive in protest over its decision to push ahead with long-term aid for the industry despite being defeated in the scottish parliament .
in a letter to his party leader jim wallace , the shetland msp said his position as a minister in the lib dem / labour coalition executive had become " untenable " .
he said his commitment to his constituents and to one of shetland 's main industries was his first priority .
he stated : " the decision to resign has not been made lightly but the scottish executive fisheries policy has made my position as a minister untenable .
" i have therefore decided that , in order to carry out my duties to my shetlands constituents , i have no alternative but to resign . "
the compensation row overshadowed the visit of prime minister tony blair on friday to the scottish labour party conference in inverness .
mr blair , who was jeered by fishermen , made only a passing reference to the fishing industry in his speech to the party faithful .
as he left the conference centre a group of around 20 fishermen carrying protest banners booed his departure .
their banners carried slogans such as " save our stocks " , " save our fishing industry " and some derogatory remarks about fisheries minister rhona brankin .
fishing leaders and opposition politicians have called on the executive to fund a short-term tie-up of boats by skippers .
fishermen have tied up their boats voluntarily because they say the eu cod recovery plan , closing large areas of the north sea , forced them to fish for undersized stock , threatening future catches .
the executive said it was introducing a long-term decommissioning scheme worth Â£ 25m , but msps rejected the plan .
total disarray despite the vote , the executive said it would push ahead with the scheme .
snp leader john swinney said of the deputy minister 's departure : " this extraordinary development leaves the lab lib government in a state of total disarray .
" tavish scott 's resignation as tom mccabe 's deputy proves that the government 's refusal to abide by the will of scotland 's parliament , and the united voice of the scottish fishing industry , is utterly untenable .
" the government 's position has completely unravelled , which is why they must immediately back down and implement a compensated tie-up scheme for the fishing industry . "
turmoil scottish tory leader david mcletchie msp claimed the collapse of the coalition was now inevitable .
he said : " the resignation of tavish scott underlines the turmoil and within the executive coalition .
the lib dems are a schizophrenic party , who for the best part of two years have tried to be both a party of government and a party of opposition at one and the same time . "
meanwhile , mr wallace expressed his " profound regret " at mr scott 's decision to resign and expressed gratitude for his personal support .
