candidate no more : beijing is now a winner more than 200,000 people packed into tiananmen square to celebrate the news - the largest spontaneous demonstrations since the democracy movement of 1989 .
" smiles everywhere , joy ignites , " read the headline in the beijing morning post .
even top political leaders , including president jiang zemin , joined the crowds , grinning broadly and hugging ecstatic revellers .
" comrades , we express our deep thanks to all our friends around the world and to the ioc for helping to make beijing successful in its olympic bid , " said the president .
welcomed in taipei china 's nationalist rival taiwan welcomed the olympic decision , with many believing that it could reduce the military and political tensions between the two countries .
" only by maintaining regional peace and stability can the olympic spirit be truly realised , " said a taiwanese government spokesman .
the united daily news said the olympics would bring " new rules of engagement and new thinking designed to create a win-win situation " .
beijing has threatened to attack taiwan if the island declares independence or drags its feet on unification talks .
since the communists came to power in beijing in 1949 , they have regarded taiwan as a breakaway province .
economic boost some in beijing predict the olympics will bring an investment bonanza which will transform the city .
long faces for the osaka delegation at a bar in the city , real estate agent shi li , 26 , said the decision had hugely improved his job prospects .
" i believe i will be running my own real estate agency by 2008 , " he said .
but 22-year-old student sun rongrong expressed a widespread fear that billions of dollars in olympic-related construction projects will end up filling the pockets of corrupt officials .
" i 'm a bit worried because such a huge opportunity will introduce a lot of chances for corruption , " she said .
fears that china 's human rights record would again block beijing 's bid evaporated after the city received 56 votes in the second round of voting , well ahead of main rivals toronto -lrb- 22 votes -rrb- and paris -lrb- 18 votes -rrb- .
richard bunting of amnesty international said china 's human rights abuses would now be in the global spotlight in the run-up to and during the 2008 games .
" it is a terrible irony that as the chinese authorities have campaigned to host the 2008 olympics , repression and injustice have escalated in the country .

tibet 's government-in-exile in new delhi , india , condemned the decision to award the games to beijing , saying the move gave an " international stamp of approval " to china 's human rights violations .
but many ioc members embraced the position that the olympics would promote positive change in china .
disappointed runners-up many regarded toronto as the strongest runner-up in the bid to host the games .
paul henderson , head of the bidding team for the canadian city , said : " we did a great job but the odds were against us .
now they -lsb- the ioc -rsb- have to live with their decision . "
a bbc correspondent in paris says the french capital 's olympic bid team are bitterly disappointed at faring much worse in the voting than they thought they would .
our correspondent adds that they feel they have lost to a political decision rather than being judged on the strength of their bid .

but white house officials say that will go to talks in germany with no alternative to the kyoto protocol that president bush withdrew from earlier this year .
mr bush called the agreement " fatally flawed " and said that it would harm the us economy .
but he is facing pressure from both parties in congress to address climate change .
new initiatives the bush administration 's new climate change initiatives include a $ 120m investment in nasa research of the natural carbon cycle , climate modelling and links between atmospheric chemistry and the climate .
mr bush said the studies would help to " reduce uncertainties " about global warming .
other initiatives would study forestry and land use policies in brazil and belize and a $ 14m " debt-for-forest " deal el salvador conserve its rain forests .
the announcements come as the us prepares to attend climate talks in bonn .
in a surprise move early this year , mr bush announced that the us would pull put out of the kyoto protocol on global climate change .
in addition his concern that the pact would harm the us economy , he also criticised the pact for exempting developing countries including china and india from emissions cuts .
when he announced the united states ' exit from the pact , he promised to develop an alternative plan that would not harm the economies of the us or other signatories .
however , us officials said that they would not be presenting an alternative to the kyoto protocol in upcoming climate talks in bonn .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said the administration is carrying out a cabinet-level review on ways to reduce greenhouse gases .
praise and criticism conservatives have praised mr bush for rejecting the pact , but environmental groups , angered at the rejection of the treaty , are calling on the president to come forward with his alternatives .
charli coon , an energy policy analyst at the heritage foundation , praised mr bush for rejecting the treaty and said that it would have driven up petrol prices by 30 % and electricity costs by at least 50 % .
she said that mr bush was right to reject a treaty that would have wreaked economic chaos in the united states , and she bristles at the portrayal of the us as unconcerned about pollution .
she pointed out that the us passed the clean air act in 1970 and that while energy consumption in the us increased by 42 % since then , emissions decreased by 31 % .
and she said that the us should not commit itself to any international agreement until the science is settled .
but environmental groups are calling on mr bush to act and offer concrete measures to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" president bush says he takes global warming seriously , but he is stalling instead of acting to cut global warming pollution , " said david hawkins , director of the national resources defence council 's climate centre .
and mr hawkins condemned the administration 's energy plan for its reliance on fossil fuels , which he said would accelerate global warming .
pressure from congress the pressure for president bush address climate change is not coming solely from environmental groups but also from members of both parties in congress .
senator jim jeffords , who defected from the republican party and tipped the balance of power in the senate to the democrats , has said that he will make global warming his first priority as the chairman of the senate environment and public works committee .
mr jeffords also said that he wants mr bush to rejoin negotiations on the kyoto protocol .
and republican senator john mccain , who challenged mr bush for the presidential nomination , joined democratic senator john kerry in challenging mr bush to help congress craft legislation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions , one of the gases blamed for climate change .
mr kerry blasted the administration in its assertion that it is studying the issue and said president bush had blocked several domestic and international initiatives to curb greenhouse gas emissions .
" we 're in fact being misled .
the president is not just studying the issue , " kerry said .
outrage from europe but the most vocal criticism of mr bush 's withdrawal from the kyoto protocol has come from europe .
the anger stems from the perception that mr bush brushed aside 10 years of negotiations without seeming to be informed , said michael grubb , professor of climate change and energy policy , imperial college .
supporters of mr bush have countered that attacks by europeans are disingenuous because only one european country had ratified the pact .
but mr grubb said that american president is being seen as deliberately misleading the american public .
negotiations on rules and implementation still need to be completed before countries were expected to ratify the pact , and those negotiations are still ongoing , he said .
and he added , " that is very inflammatory thing to say to governments that had begun to fight some very important battles domestically . "
he pointed to the difficulty that prime minister blair had in pursuing the climate levy during his first term .
and as for an alternative , he said , " we 've heard no squeak as to what the alternatives are comprised of . "

it is the latest in a number of recent incidents in which journalists in angola have been stopped in the course of their duties .
rafael marques and myself were stopped by the police while interviewing people in the resettlement camp at viana , some 30 km -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the angolan capital .
the people who live there have all been forcibly removed from the inner city neighbourhood of boavista , which the government says is unsafe for habitation , but which appears to have been earmarked for commercial development .
living in tents the people in the camp , who used to have houses in boavista are now living in tents , with minimum facilities .
many of them said they can not afford the transport fares to get to work in the city .
we had been visiting the camp with a group of angolan members of parliament and the lawyer acting on behalf of the boavista community .
mr marques and i had become separated from the rest of the group and were talking to residents when we were stopped by two officers carrying automatic weapons .
driven away they escorted mr marques to a police truck , in which he was driven away .
he was released after about an hour , after the lawyer persuaded the local government official to request that the police let him go .
he said he had been threatened by the police and accused of being an agitator .
this was the third occasion in less than a week that mr marques and myself had been stopped by the authorities while covering the story of the removals from boavista .
detained without trial mr marques , who had previously been detained without trial for several months because of his writing , now works for the open society foundation , an international body which campaigns for human rights and freedom of expression .
recently , he has argued that the media situation in angola has been deteriorating , citing the murder of one journalist , the interrogation by police of another and government pressure on an independent catholic radio station .
but also in luanda today , norberto dos santos , the information secretary of the ruling mpla party , insisted that the press in angola remained free .
he said though that journalists needed to seek permission from the authorities when covering certain stories .

the two craft linked up early on saturday above south america .
us space agency nasa said that the docking was 15 minutes later than planned but otherwise smooth and uneventful .
it will take a total of three spacewalks to bolt the new airlock , and the gas tanks needed to operate it , on to the iss .
when , fitted , the new airlock will simplify the currently complex depressurisation process .
as shuttle commander steven lindsey guided the shuttle in , astronaut jim voss aboard the iss told its crew to smile for the space station cameras .
" you look beautiful , " lindsey said as he caught sight of the iss .
" well thanks , just wait until you get real close , " voss replied .
universal connections up until now , whenever astronauts on the iss have needed to go outside the platform , they have had to go through a docked space shuttle .
unlike the orbiter , the station does not have a proper airlock to allow astronauts to safely make the transition from a pressurised environment to the vacuum of space .
airlock spec material - aluminium length - 5.5 metres diameter - 4 metres weight - 6,064 kilograms volume - 34 cubic metres cost - $ 164 million , including gas tanks the joint airlock module -lrb- jam -rrb- will make the presence of a shuttle unnecessary .
what is more , its universal fittings mean it will not discriminate among spacesuits .
unlike the shuttle 's airlock , where the communications system and connections for oxygen and coolant will only accept american suits , the $ 164m jam will eventually accept russian connections as well .
three-bedroom house " once the airlock is installed , the hatches between a visiting space shuttle and the space station can remain open , " said mike hawes , nasa deputy associate administrator for the space station .
" this is important because in previous missions we 've had to open and close the hatches several times to maintain correct pressure during spacewalks .
now , we 'll be able to keep those doors open , providing greater efficiency during joint orbital activities . "
the jam , which measures four metres -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- across and 5.5 metres -lrb- 18 feet -rrb- in length , will be anchored to the iss with the help of the station 's advanced canadarm2 , which was added to the platform in april .
the airlock 's installation will complete phase two of the space station 's construction , which began in 1998 with the arrival of the russian-built zarya base block in orbit .
once the jam is in place , the platform will represent 424 cubic metres of living space - a greater volume than a conventional three-bedroom house .

the minister said : " we promised to keep the terms of the scheme under review and , in recognition of the on-going effect on businesses from foot-and-mouth , we have now decided to extend the scheme .
" the 17 rural councils covered by this scheme will continue to receive the additional support from the executive in providing hardship relief to businesses in their area . "
foot-and-mouth has compounded the problems of falling farm incomes in some areas of scotland .
dumfries and galloway was the worst hit region during the outbreak , with the borders also badly affected .
since the first scottish case at lockerbie on 1 march there have been 187 confirmed cases across the two regions .
in total about 1,500 farms have lost 750,000 animals .
tourism and other small businesses have suffered through the restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the disease .
it was feared tourists would be put off from booking holidays in scotland because of the outbreak .

we think it 's a peaceful treaty that highlights a quest for co-operation , peace and prosperity chinese foreign ministry official after many months of negotiations the two sides will sign a major treaty , putting some flesh on the bones of the " strategic partnership " that has been talked about at least since a visit to beijing by ex-president boris yeltsin in 1996 .
it 's said that the document - the first of its kind since 1949 - will set the framework for this partnership over the next 10 years .
although officials stress that it is not directed against any third party , few analysts doubt that a major stimulus has been the desire , on both sides , to stand up to us global dominance .
multi-polar world nato 's bombing of serbia during the kosovo crisis is said to have acted as a wake-up call in both moscow and beijing , and the two capitals are now just as united - at least on the surface - in their opposition to us plans for a missile defence shield .
behind the smiles , anxieties remain if russia and china work together - the thinking goes in moscow - they can show the us that the old bi-polar world has given way to a multi-polar , not a uni-polar one .
the two countries also have a range of other shared interests and concerns .
one of the most important is their fear of separatism and islamic fundamentalism from xinjiang , in north-west china , to chechnya in the caucasus , which threatens to destabilise the states of central asia .
both seek to restrict us and turkish influence in this region .
and both countries would also dearly like to raise trade turnover from a disappointing $ 8bn in 2000 - less than half the target of $ 20bn .
us trade china is already russia 's biggest customer for arms , accounting for more than half of all russian defence sales in 2000 , yet both sides see this as a promising area for further growth .
trade in 2000 russia-china : $ 8bn arms deals : about $ 2bn us-china : $ 75bn there are also ambitious -lrb- some say unrealistic -rrb- plans for mammoth pipelines to carry russian oil and gas to china 's energy-hungry cities .
but despite all this common ground , the interests of the two sides still clearly differ in important respects , and their smiles mask serious anxieties .
crucially , while keen to challenge us dominance in world affairs , both are still eager to maintain good relations with washington .
putin-jiang meetings in 2001 shanghai : june moscow : july shanghai : october economically , china does not want to jeopardise its trade with the us - which last year was worth nearly 10 times as much as its trade with russia - while russia sees the west as its primary source of trade and investment .
militarily , the two countries ' joint opposition to president bush 's plans for missile defence , can not disguise the fact that russia has offered to work with the us on a system of limited or " theatre " missile defence - but china is bitterly opposed to such a system , because of its potential application in japan and taiwan .
westward-leaning russia beijing must also be aware of the widely held view that russia will drive a hard bargain with the us on missile defence , but will eventually capitulate - because its own nuclear deterrent , unlike china 's , will not be seriously undermined .
will they do a deal on missile defence ?
moscow , meanwhile , knows that china will not be seriously disturbed if nato moves into the baltic states , in defiance of all russian objections , and is unlikely to provide moscow with much support .
there is also the question of russia 's spiritual sense of belonging .
the country spans both europe and asia , but under the st petersburger , vladimir putin , it is looking increasingly west .
in his state of the nation speech earlier this year , it was widely noted that mr putin emphasised the importance of relations with europe without once mentioning the us .
but he also failed to mention china .
russian analysts who take a long view of the future frequently argue that arming china now with sophisticated weapons , though lucrative in the short term , is a risky strategy .
they see , on the one hand , russia 's run-down and sparsely populated far eastern territories , and , on the other , an overpopulated and economically vigorous china - and they ask how long a " strategic partnership " with this budding superpower is sustainable .
