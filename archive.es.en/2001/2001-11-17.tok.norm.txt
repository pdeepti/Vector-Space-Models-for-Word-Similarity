the convention on international trade in endangered species -lrb- cites -rrb- said traders had exploited loopholes in local law to deal in the caspian sea sturgeon , whose eggs , the agency said , make it " perhaps the single most valuable wildlife resource anywhere in the world . "
following months of monitoring caviar movements from the united arab emirates , cites discovered that much of the caviar worth $ 25 million worth that left the uae during the first 10 months of this year appeared to be of unlawful origin .
the agency said organised crime groups , based mainly in dubai , had been co-ordinating the caviar smuggling by forging documents and making false declarations to customs officials to obtain re-export certificates from local authorities .
the caviar was then shipped to asia , europe and north america and sold as being of lawful origin .
mounting problems during its investigations , the agency said it was helped by law-enforcement agencies in several countries , and especially by the russian federation , where the caviar is thought to have been harvested .
problems with caviar smuggling have mounted since the 1991 collapse of the soviet union as poachers have moved in on the market which had formally been dominated by the ussr and iran .
but the convention warned that although it had clamped down on the illegal trade and would continue to monitor the uae , such substantial profits had clearly already been made that it was highly likely that those engaged in the illegal trade would simply move their operations elsewhere .

the united nations world food programme says secure conditions are imperative to deliver aid to six million people across the country .
its director , catherine bertini , has welcomed the deployment of international troops .
she said the agency had met its monthly target for food convoys into the country for the first time .
but medecins sans frontieres has said a military presence could compromise the independent reputation of the agencies .
msf 's operations director in afghanistan , christopher stokes , also said that the arrival of french troops currently on their way to the northern town of mazar-e sharif had aroused suspicions among the local population .
to date only a limited number of soldiers have been deployed in afghanistan , but more british troops are expected in the coming days and france has announced that it is to send troops and planes to help humanitarian operations .
earlier , the aid agency oxfam called for an immediate airlift of food into afghanistan because of the continuing insecurity of land routes .
un aid agencies say they have begun sending international staff back into the country for the first time since the american-led air strikes on afghanistan began .
but the breakdown in law and order and reports of looting in some areas has meant that un food convoys have not left from pakistan in the past three days .
mr stokes says the looting in mazar has targeted ethnic pashtuns , the largest ethnic group in the country but in a minority in the north .
getting supplies to certain north-west provinces , such as badghis and ghor , is almost impossible .
military help oxfam said it wanted airlifts of food to be carried out as soon as possible .
and as a last resort , the military could even be involved .
the spokesman said the announcement that british troops had arrived at bagram to look at turning the airport into a hub for humanitarian relief flights was encouraging , but the project could take weeks .
a spokeswoman for the world food programme said supplies were coming in from other countries including uzbekistan , and they already had some stocks .
she said they would assess the situation next week and discuss other options including airlifts .

argentine confidence on the edge of the meeting one of the countries most heavily in debt , argentina , has expressed optimism that it can find a way out of its economic difficulties .
argentine economy minister domingo cavallo emerged from a meeting with top us officials in ottawa , expressing confidence that he will receive support for his plan to reduce his struggling country 's debt payments .

mr cavallo met us treasury secretary paul o 'neill , federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and undersecretary of international affairs john taylor .

the picturesque county has some of the finest wildlife habitats in scotland , in addition to some new high-tech industries .
but local labour msp john home robertson says changes in planning priorities could lead to much of the county being " up for grabs " by open-cast mining companies .
john home robertson has voiced fears " originally just a small area of derelict land outside musselburgh was earmarked for opencast , " said mr robertson .
" but i think civil servants gave in to last-minute lobbying by the mining companies and now the structure plan includes the whole lothian coalfield - a vast area . "
local councillors are also furious that the mining firms have been able to put their case while the government turned a deaf ear to the lobbying of east lothian council .
provost pat o 'brien said he was very concerned about the situation .
" the decision could lead opencast operators to think they can move in and have a field day , " he said .
' planning blight ' mining companies are already targeting the area .
one site , at harry 's burn near tranent , is currently the subject of a public inquiry - after three previous applications for opencast on the site were turned down .
mr home robertson thinks this is an early sign of the planning blight which will affect the whole county .
i am not against all open-cast mining , but what is being proposed is not tolerable john home robertson " the firms keep coming back and this new structure plan can only encourage them , " he said .
but is this opposition simply a case of ' not in my back yard ' ?
the coal companies certainly think so and point out that the mining operations will bring new jobs to the area .
however , mr home robertson remains unconvinced - and says that the local economy is already thriving .
" we have a number of bio-science and high-tech companies here and that is an area of employment we want to expand , " he said .
planning policies he believes these industries will be put off east lothian by the pollution from the mining operations - even though they would bring far more jobs than the mines .
the msp is to raise the issue in the scottish parliament and plans to meet ministers in an attempt to get the planning policies amended .
" we have to bear in mind that this area was one of the first in the country to be mined for coal , hundreds of years ago , " he said .
" there is a tradition here , and i am not against all open-cast mining , but what is being proposed is not tolerable . "

jim wallace , of the scottish liberal democrats , has travelled to bodmin to address this weekend 's annual meeting of the cornish constitutional convention .
liberal democrats in cornwall have backed the call for an assembly - " senedh kernow " - but the county 's labour party has decided against .
euro mp caroline jackson and st ives mp andrew george are also addressing the gathering in bodmin .
the convention 's website says its call for an assembly fits the government 's commitment to devolution - " not only for scotland , wales and northern ireland but also the regions of ' england ' . "
convention chairman bert biscoe is claiming popular support , with a petition of 50,000 signatures .
" this exceptionally high level of support springs partly from cornwall 's historic and cultural distinctiveness , but also from the heightened desire to reverse the continuing decline of the cornish economy . "
cornwall 's heritage as a celtic nation has long been in resurgence .
it has its own language , flag and patron saint , st piran .
cornish tartan the campaign for an assembly was launched on st piran 's day 2000 .
cornwall already has an " unofficial " national assembly in the form of the gorsedd , its own order of celtic bards .
some cornish nationalists resent english influence in the county .
they won a victory this week over " english " tourist signs .
paint has been daubed on the familiar brown signs throughout the county , blotting out the tudor rose symbol used throughout england .
now cornwall county council is asking people to come up with an alternative symbol .
councillor mike gillbard , chairman of the county 's community life committee , said he deplored the vandalism - but it could result in an image boost for cornwall .
