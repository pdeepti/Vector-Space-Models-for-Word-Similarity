us troops will play a leading role in information gathering and logistics - a contribution that experts say reflects washington 's reluctance to get heavily involved .

most of the troops will be flown in from outside the balkans , following a decision by nato defence ministers in may to maintain troops in kosovo at their current level .

experts say one risk the task force will face is from rebels who have not heard about the ceasefire , mistaking the nato troops for macedonians .
another is from mines and booby traps laid along mountain paths .
bbc defence correspondent jonathan marcus says one fear is that once the rebels are disarmed the pressure on the skopje government will be relieved .
it may then be very hard to gather the necessary impetus for fundamental political reforms .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- wpp launches bid battle for tempus categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 20 august , 2001 , 06:34 gmt 07:34 uk wpp launches bid battle for tempus wpp chief sir martin sorrell is expanding his business marketing and advertising giant wpp has launched the bid battle for tempus , an agency that plans and organises how and where to run ad campaigns , with a 555p per share offer .
the counter bid - valuing the firm at £ 437m - was widely expected and rivals an agreed offer from france 's havas .
the french company is prepared to pay 541p per share .
wpp , which already owns 22 % of tempus , made the bid as it released first half results , reporting a rise in pre-tax profit to £ 247.6m from £ 137.7m last time .
the tempus board on monday withdrew its recommendation to shareholders to accept the havas bid after wpp 's offer .
the haves and havas nots havas , the world 's fifth largest advertising agency , wants to build up its media buying business and its offer is already considered by analysts to be over the odds at £ 425m .
without tempus , havas will lack the clout to compete with larger players in the media buying world as its customers look for global agencies .
havas is thought to be mulling a renewed bid of about 570p .
tempus shares closed at 582.5p on friday , after rising during the week in anticipation of a bid battle .
tempus is not a must buy for wpp , but it would consolidate its position as the world 's leading media buyer with its two existing firms , media edge and mindshare .
wpp will also make a handsome profit on its 22 % stake , which it bought for an average of 200p per share , if it loses .
it 's tempus shares will have more than doubled in value . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's julian bailey " tempus ' main business is deciding where and when ads should be placed " wpp chief executive sir martin sorrell " it was n't a hostile bid ... it was a bid for neutrality . "
