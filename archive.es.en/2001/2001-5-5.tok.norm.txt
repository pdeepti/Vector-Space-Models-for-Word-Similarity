residents of capaya , a village in the andes nearly 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south-east of the capital lima , found the remains of up to 80 bodies while building a new church .
the local authorities said the graves were on the site of a former military base , but would not speculate as to whether the army or the guerrillas - such as the far-left shining path -lrb- sendero luminoso -rrb- - were responsible for the deaths .
the area has now been cordoned off and officials have launched a full inquiry .

dna experts are now investigating ways to stop the insect 's decline .
they are using genetic technology to build up the first accurate picture of the diversity and health of remaining bee populations .
three of the 19 uk species are already extinct and a further nine are on the critically endangered list .
if bumblebees were to die out , it would be a tragedy and an environmental disaster dr dave goulson their numbers have been falling in recent years , largely due to intensive farming practices .
dr dave goulson , a senior lecturer at the university of southampton , says the picture is serious .
" the last 50 years have seen hedgerows ripped up , and most of the flower-rich grasslands once used for grazing have been reseeded with rye grass .
" if bumblebees were to die out , it would be a tragedy and an environmental disaster .
they are major pollinators of wild flowers .
" if the bees disappear , the plants will set fewer seeds and may themselves vanish . "
economic impact in chichester , less than 80 kilometres -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- from southampton , gerry hayman inspects a vast glasshouse of tomato plants .
bees are used to pollinate commercially-grown tomatoes over a site covering nine hectares -lrb- 23 acres -rrb- more than 1,000 tonnes of the fruit are growing here at any one time .
the humble bumblebee plays a critical role .
in all , 8,000 buzz around - pollinating the whole crop .
" none of our bees are taken from the wild , they 're bred and imported from holland .
we use them to pollinate the plants , " says mr hayman , chief scientific officer for the british tomato growers ' association .
" years ago , the job was done by hand - growers would tap each plant individually to loosen the pollen .
it was a laborious and time-consuming job .
" if numbers were to decline it could have a serious economic impact on the industry . "
genetic fingerprint because the insects ' colonies are largely underground and hard to find , conservationists have problems assessing the state of the various species .
dr goulson has developed a technique to catch the bees and conduct a dna analysis .
can genetic technology save the bumblebee ?
they are trapped in nets and a miniature hypodermic needle is used to remove a tiny amount of the bee 's equivalent of blood , which carries a genetic fingerprint .
' ' individuals from different nests are not visually distinguishable , but the dna analysis allows us to tell them apart , " says dr goulson .
" by identifying which bees are sisters - and therefore from the same nest - it should be possible to determine just how many separate nests there are in an area .
" if we know in which parts of the country they still have strongholds , we can determine what types of land-use suit them best . "
the future of a whole host of crops from oil seed rape , strawberries and apples as well as wild flowers could depend on the research and the plight of the bumblebee .

the draft report by the commission , headed by the former american senator george mitchell , has not yet been published .
but it is understood to warn that it will be hard to stop the violence unless all settlement building in the west bank and gaza strip is frozen .
israeli sources say the document also criticises the palestinians .
according to the leaked details , it speaks of a worrying lack of control over palestinian leader yasser arafat 's security forces and other armed palestinian elements .
israel and the palestinians have been given two weeks to examine the report , during which they have been asked not to make any public comment .
but as they absorb the details , violence continues on the west bank .
israeli soldiers shot dead an islamic jihad militant near the west bank town of bethlehem on saturday , according to witnesses .
they said israeli special forces hit ahmed khalil issa ismail , 35 , with more than 20 bullets in an early morning attack in the village of ertass , close to bethlehem .
the israel army said it had " no record " of an operation or disturbances in the area .
islamic jihad activists have been behind attacks in the past that have killed scores of israelis .
sharon visit the mitchell commission reportedly does not blame either side for starting the fighting which has raged for some seven months .
the palestinians say the violence was triggered by ariel sharon 's controversial visit to holy sites in jerusalem when he was still the israeli opposition leader .
mr sharon - who became prime minister in february - has gone so far as to describe the mitchell commission report as an " historic mistake " .
he says no one has the right to put israel on trial .
his stated policy is that there will be no halt to settlement expansion unless it is part of a comprehensive peace deal .
difficulties the commission was set up at an arab-israeli summit last october , but it has been dogged by difficulties ever since .
its other recommendations are believed to include an end to the use by israeli forces of rubber-coated metal bullets against unarmed palestinian demonstrators .
israel may however take comfort from the commission 's apparent failure to back palestinian calls for an international force to be deployed .
at least 500 people have died since palestinians began a widespread uprising against israeli occupation in september , including about 420 palestinians and 75 israelis jews .

bobby sands from west belfast died on 5 may that year after refusing food for 66 days .
he was elected as mp for fermanagh and south tyrone in a by-election while he was on hunger strike .
sinn fein 's jim gibney was a key figure in the sands election campaign .
he believes the roots of the current peace process can be traced back to that period .
" republicans got more confidence about opening up a new front , ie , the elections , " said mr gibney .
" many republicans then were trying to argue for the building of a political party ; let 's get involved in elections and 1981 , tragic year that it was , encouraged republicans to take that step . "
one of the key demands of republican prisoners was the right to wear their own clothes .
when this was refused they started a blanket protest where they abandoned the prison uniform in favour of blankets .
two years later the protest escalated with prisoners smearing their cells with their own excrement , which became known as the dirty protest .
' we were shattered ' the ira 's commander in the maze prison in 1981 was brendan " bic " mcfarlane .
he heard the news of bobby sands ' death through bbc radio on a smuggled handset hidden in his cell .
" i distinctly remember it was david capper who was the newscaster , " he said .
" he said that at 17 minutes past one , bobby sands had died .
" not just me but everybody else , we were shattered .
" the british had chosen a battleground to defeat the republican struggle , " said mr mcfarlane .
he added : " the prisoners took it up with the blanket protest right through to the hunger strike period and the hunger strikers took up the challenge as well .
" it was the only means that they felt they could attempt to defeat the british policy and they did .
" criminalisation was nailed to the ground by the hunger strikers beyond a shadow of a doubt and as a direct consequence of that we have had the political development that has brought us to where we are today . "
david ervine of the progressive unionist party , which has links to the loyalist paramilitary ulster volunteer force , said some loyalists had a grudging respect for the hunger strikers .
but mr ervine , a former uvf prisoner , accused the republican leadership of cynically using the events of that period to launch sinn fein .
" i have no doubt that the hunger strike was sinn fein 's launching pad , an act of serious cynicism , " said mr ervine .
" i do believe that it was avoidable .
" the british government i believe were to blame for the policy at the time . "

bobby sands from west belfast died on 5 may that year after refusing food for 66 days .
he was elected as mp for fermanagh and south tyrone in a by-election while he was on hunger strike .
sinn fein 's jim gibney was a key figure in the sands election campaign .
he believes the roots of the current peace process can be traced back to that period .
bobby sands : first hunger striker to die " republicans got more confidence about opening up a new front , ie , the elections , " said mr gibney .
" many republicans then were trying to argue for the building of a political party ; let 's get involved in elections and 1981 , tragic year that it was , encouraged republicans to take that step . "
one of the key demands of republican prisoners was the right to wear their own clothes .
when this was refused they started a blanket protest where they abandoned the prison uniform in favour of blankets .
two years later the protest escalated with prisoners smearing their cells with their own excrement , which became known as the dirty protest .
' we were shattered ' the ira 's commander in the maze prison in 1981 was brendan " bic " mcfarlane .
he heard the news of bobby sands ' death through bbc radio on a smuggled handset hidden in his cell .
" i distinctly remember it was david capper who was the newscaster , " he said .
" he said that at 17 minutes past one , bobby sands had died .
" not just me but everybody else , we were shattered .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- prescott accused of tube u-turn low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk politics front page world uk uk politics interviews business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's simon montague " striking a deal is still looking like being an uphill challenge " real 56k deputy prime minister , john prescott " this deal is still the public private partnership " real 28k saturday , 5 may , 2001 , 08:37 gmt 09:37 uk prescott accused of tube u-turn the deal follows months of negotiations the government 's decision to give london transport commissioner bob kiley overall control of the underground has been attacked as an " astonishing and dramatic u-turn " .
in a surprise move , ministers have put him in charge of negotiations for a public private partnership -lrb- ppp -rrb- - despite the fact that he is strongly opposed to the policy .
shadow transport minister bernard jenkin said the announcement was " the most astonishing and dramatic u-turn in government policy and was done on friday to try and minimise the embarassment " .
it is like the french government putting the duke of wellington in charge of the french army in the middle of the battle of waterloo tony travers , london school of economics the announcement by deputy prime minister john prescott reportedly came after the intervention of tony blair but the government denies suggestions that it is an attempt to end the dispute before the election .
mr jenkin added : " the government can not possibly say that mr kiley has capitulated .
" we always said that bob kiley should be in charge of the contracts to bring in private capital and private management expertise . "
preferred bidders mr kiley , who has long opposed ppp for the tube and still plans to take the government to court over it later this month , said the deal was " by no means a solution to the problem " .
he insisted : " i ca n't say that i am optimistic and i ca n't say that i am pessimistic . "
under the deal , mr kiley will control both the publicly-run trains and negotiations with companies chosen as preferred bidders to refurbish and run the tracks and signals .
mr kiley will oversee ppp negotiations he also becomes chairman of london transport , the umbrella organisation which controls london underground .
mr kiley had opposed the ppp , fearing that splitting the system between three companies will hamper safety .
mr prescott said he was " delighted to come to this agreement " .
he denied suggestions the move was deliberately timed close to the upcoming election .
" what i have done today is what i have offered in february , when no one knew when the election would be , " he told bbc news .
mr prescott said the real issue was to try to get the necessary long-term finance for the tube .
' new beginning ' and prime minister tony blair said : " i 've met with bob kiley , heard his concerns and have confidence in his ability to deliver a ppp which meets those concerns and ours and will be good for london . "
mr kiley described the deal as a " new beginning " but added : " it 's no secret that i have not been a fan of the so-called ppp .
this is a total climbdown by the government and a humiliation for john prescott , who has wasted so many years on his wretched ppp bernard jenkin , tory transport spokesman " but i have agreed that working within that very broad framework , we can come to a solution here . "
the agreement comes on the first anniversary of ken livingstone 's election as mayor of london on an anti-ppp ticket .
mr livingstone said : " mr kiley will be directly leading the negotiations on the london underground with the goal of achieving the unified management control which he has always said is essential for safety and efficiency . "
mr kiley , an american , was brought in to run transport in the capital after being credited with making big improvements to the subway systems in new york and boston .
susan kramer , who is chairing the liberal democrats london general election campaign , said mr kiley 's appointment was an improvement on the government 's original plans .
" bob kiley must have genuine freedom to negotiate any aspect of the transaction and even to say no if necessary , " said ms kramer , who is a member of the transport for london board .
