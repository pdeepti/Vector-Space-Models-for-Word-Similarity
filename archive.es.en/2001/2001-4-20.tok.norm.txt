several ministers visited historic sites across the country in a bid to restore public confidence before the peak summer period .
the purpose of the visits was to publicise next weekend 's initiative by historic scotland to open all its properties to the public for free .

his deputy jim wallace travelled to scara brae in orkney , while communities minister jackie baillie went to dumbarton castle .
finance minister peter peacock also travelled to fort george to encourage members of the public to visit their local historic attractions for free next weekend .

the offensive comes one day after the appointment of new visitscotland chief executive rod lynch was announced .
during a news conference to reveal his stewardship of the tourist body , mr lynch admitted that he would be using a business trip to the united states for leisure purposes .
he also told assembled media that the job of rebuilding the industry would take several years before it could once again enjoy the type of success seen in the post-braveheart period .
the 51-year-old has spent most of his career in the airline industry , but has also held posts at forte hotels and the bbc .

the city council has decided that this years party will last four days instead of the traditional five .
but it plans to increase the financial benefits to the capital by combining the new year party with christmas celebrations to create the world 's largest winter festival .
councillors believe that two weeks of festive celebrations could rival the annual arts festival and generate around £ 40m for the city .
plans to scale down the hogmanay celebrations were mooted last year amid concerns over rising costs and safety for revellers .
organisers were worried that future events would fail to attract the level of commercial sponsorship needed to pay for the five days of events .
police were also worried that people with forged passes could pose a danger to the safety of revellers .
but last year 's event passed without any major hitches and the five days of celebration reached a climax with 100,000 people taking part in the new year 's eve street party .
huge crowds edinburgh city council said that this year 's revised four day event is likely to cost around £ 1.5m and that one third of the cash had already been secured .
it is hoping that a winter festival could grow in stature to rival the city 's main arts festival , which already attracts huge crowds .
this would lessen the problem of ' seasonality ' and give the capital a more even spread of tourism cash throughout the year .
it is also being viewed as a vehicle to kick-start the scottish tourist industry which is still under performing amid the current foot-and-mouth crisis .
details of the new winter festival will be announced later this year .

badrul amin baharom , a senior official in the national justice party , keadilan , was arrested at his home at 0200 local time , party sources said .
anwar still symbolises simmering political discontent he is reported to have been detained under the internal security act , which allows indefinite detention without trial .
police were strongly criticised by local and international human rights groups for the arrest of seven anwar supporters on 10 and 11 april .
the move was designed to pre-empt violence at mass demonstrations by anwar supporters .
legal costs anwar ibrahim is currently serving 15 years on corruption and sodomy charges , which his suppporters say were politically motivated .
dr mahathir accuses his former protege of being immoral on wednesday he was ordered to pay mr mahathir more than $ 22,000 in legal costs after losing a suit for libel .
in february , the federal court , the country 's top court , threw out anwar 's $ 26m defamation suit , upholding an appeal from a lower court that the claim was " frivolous " .
the court ruled that anwar - the former deputy prime minister - had no case against his one-time mentor dr mahathir and should pay defence costs .
anwar was for years the heir apparent for the top post , but in september 1998 , he was sacked by dr mahathir on grounds of immorality .
supporters say anwar was framed he was detained later that month , and was then sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on sex and corruption convictions which he says were fabricated .
dr mahathir , who has ruled malaysia for nearly 20 years , has maintained that his former protégé was immoral and unfit to succeed him .
the issue remains a thorn in the premier 's side however , having caused deep divisions within his ethnic malay community and ruling party .

a spokesman for the sri lankan defence ministry said four tiger vessels had been sunk in the encounter off the coast of chalai in the north-east , very near to the site of an earlier clash which the navy lost on monday .
there were six ltte personnel bobbing in the water and we rescued them defence ministry spokesman brigadier sanath karunaratne said a flotilla of rebel boats had been detected in the early hours of friday morning , and intercepted .
four of the rebel craft , thought to be cargo vessels ferrying supplies to the mullaitivu base in tiger-held territory in northern sri lanka , were sunk by naval gunfire .
of the three remaining vessels , brigadier karunaratne said one had been disabled by air force attacks , another was missing and a third had made it to shore .
air force planes had gone to attack the beached vessel , he said , but held their fire because they believed civilians were being used to unload it .
" we detected another tiger boat that landed at pudhumathalan fishing village , but the pilots did not engage the target because they believed the tigers had forced civilians to unload the craft , " brigadier karunaratne said .
the brigadier said several rebels had been killed and four naval personnel wounded .
the bbc 's daniel lak in the sri lankan capital , colombo , says the navy will view the battle as a considerable victory , particularly after monday 's clash which left several naval vessels damaged .
he says the navy will also see it as revenge for the sinking of one of its gunboats last month in a rebel attack which killed four sailors .
truce the latest fighting comes despite ceasefires from both sides .
since christmas eve , the tigers have been observing a unilateral truce which they have extended every month .
it is due to expire on 24 april , but the rebels say they plan to extend it again to help norwegian attempts to broker peace .
they are demanding the lifting of a ban on their organisation and a longer truce before peace talks can begin .
the government announced a short ceasefire for the sri lanka new year but this was not renewed .
more than 63,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the 17-year conflict since the rebels began their fight for an independent homeland in the north and east of sri lanka .

prison officials said guzman , who is serving a life sentence , begun fasting on monday , while rebels at three other jails joined in on wednesday .
fujimori virtually wiped out peru 's rebel groups rebels from shining path and the tupac amaru revolutionary movement -lrb- mrta -rrb- are demanding new civilian and prisoner rights .
the authorities have stepped up security measures at prisons across peru , rejecting " any type of pressure or blackmail " from the inmates .
but a prisoner who identified himself as " hugo " called afp news agency to say hundreds more would join the hunger strike in solidarity with guzman .
there are some 2,800 imprisoned rebels in peru , most of them captured during disgraced former president alberto fujimori 's 10-year rule .
' unfair trial ' many of them were tried by hooded judges in military courts .
guzman , who is only taking liquids , says he did not receive a fair trial when he was sentenced to life in 1992 for treason and terrorism .
he launched a nine-day hunger strike in january , ending it after peru 's ombudsman said his demands would be presented to interim president valentin paniagua .
the mrta is best-known for the japanese embassy siege on thursday , the ombudsman , walter alban , urged the inmates to maintain the peace .
mr alban said prison conditions for those convicted of terrorism had been improved to respect inmates ' human rights .
under guzman 's leadership , the maoist shining path movement began its campaign to install a communist state in 1980 .
the mrta is best known for the 126-day siege of the japanese ambassador 's residence in lima in 1996 .
the guerrilla conflict left some 30,000 dead and caused more than $ 25bn in damage .
both rebel groups were mostly destroyed under mr fujimori 's rule , and have only been blamed for sporadic attacks in the past few years .

bbc news -pipe- reviews -pipe- ' evil ' link satisfies low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : entertainment : reviews front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 20 april , 2001 , 08:03 gmt 09:03 uk ' evil ' link satisfies celebrities have queued up to play in the uk by francine jacome in the us first it was the beatles , then the brothers gallagher , and now the weakest link , with its caustic host , anne robinson .
a new british us invasion has begun .
since the über-success of reality game shows such as who wants to be a millionaire and survivor , american audiences have been hungry for more .
sadly , the latest crop of shows have been all hype and little substance , leaving viewers disappointed .
she is a refreshing change from the overly saccharine wit of millionaire 's regis philbin though us network nbc has put a lot of effort into promoting the weakest link , there was doubt that with its millionaire-inspired set and survivor-style format of voting players off it would be anything other than another weak carbon copy .
but one taste of robinson and you get the sense that there is more to it .
listening to her attacking the contestants is akin to a horrible car wreck - you do n't want to look , but you ca n't help slipping a peek as you drive by .
there is something evilly satisfying about watching someone else get a verbal beating .
lord knows we get enough of it ourselves from our bosses .
the popularity of tv personalities such as jerry springer is proof that american audiences enjoy watching others be subjected to tough - sometimes cruel - remarks .
americans also like to be challenged , and the fact that the show throws out tough questions without the benefit of hints or lifelines makes it much more entertaining .
zingers they 're not just competing against themselves but a whole group of players who are trigger-happy about voting them off as soon as they fail .
during wednesday night 's show i found myself yelling the answers at the television and using some of the same insults that robinson threw at the contestants .
she is a refreshing change from the overly saccharine wit of millionaire 's regis philbin .
but that said , american audiences - and network programmers in particular - are extremely fickle .
time will tell if viewers grow tired of robinson 's zingers and settle back in to the comfort of their sitcoms .
i for one am always rooting for something refreshing on television and i hope the weakest link gets a fair chance .
and maybe one day if i am lucky i will find myself face to face with robinson , my knees shaking as she throws one of those juicy insults my way .
