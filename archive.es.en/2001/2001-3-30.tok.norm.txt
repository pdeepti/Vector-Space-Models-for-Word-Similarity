in its annual report on friday , entitled parades , protest and policing , the northern ireland human rights commission made the assessment after examining guidance drawn from international standards in the parades issue .
the report said that freedom of assembly included the right to parade , but that it had to be balanced against the rights and freedom of others .
the report added there were few simple answers in the marching question , and that on occasion case law generated by the european convention on human rights " appears contradictory " .
the report said : " human rights legislation will not provide easy solutions to political and community relations problems .
" however , it should make a contribution to providing structures within which disputes can be justly resolved . "
continuing disagreement the report was published as efforts continue to try to find agreement on controversial annual parades by the protestant orange order .
there has as yet been little progress in attempts to find a resolution to the portadown dispute between residents and orangemen over the annual drumcree parade .
report co-author dominic bryan said that unless more tolerance was developed on each side of parades disputes , there was little hope the issue could be resolved .
he said : " unless we develop a toleration of each other 's political beliefs there will remain a significant public order problem at many events and this will threaten the rights to freedom of assembly for all communities in northern ireland .
" inevitably this will make political developments more difficult . "
' responsibilities ' brice dickson , head of the human rights commission warned people against " cherry-picking " from the report .
he said : " i hope people will use this report to increase awareness of the rights and responsibilities that surround these complex issues .
" such understanding is important in our efforts to develop a bill of rights for northern ireland . "
explaining the difficulty in trying to apply european legislation to the marching issue the report said the right to assembly included the right to : peaceful protest annoy and give offence to opponents parade counter demonstrate a degree of protection from the state to exercise the right to assembly peaceful protest even if a counter protest threatens disorder impede vehicular traffic and pedestrians however it said the right to assembly did not include the right to : assemble for an indefinite length of time assemble for purely social reasons provoke others to violence hold a parade or protest if ' hangers on ' threaten disorder offend religious sensibilities offend public morality .
the report also said assembly could be reasonably restricted if there was a fear of public disorder - whether by those demonstrating or opponents - if there was a recent history of violence at the location or the state felt it could not control disorder .
it could also be restricted if the event could take place in an alternative manner or location or if a ban was for a limited time or defined geographical area .
the report said courts could help make decisions , but could not solve all problems .
" a long-term resolution of the parades issue will depend on a greater understanding of rights and responsibilities , improved community relations and political accommodation , " it added .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- boeing dumps plans for super jumbo low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's simon montague " for boeing it is time to turn eleswhere " real 56k robert hewson , aerospace consultant " boeing have missed the boat " real 56k emirates group manager , maurice flannigan " the aircraft would probably shave one hour off an eight or nine hour sector " real 28k friday , 30 march , 2001 , 06:11 gmt 07:11 uk boeing dumps plans for super jumbo boeing hopes speed will beat size in the future boeing will build a near supersonic flying wing after ditching plans to build a super jumbo to rival airbus industrie 's a380 super jumbo jet .
the proposed " sonic cruiser " would fly just under the speed of sound , shaving an hour off coast-to-coast , about two hours off trans-atlantic and three hours off flights to asia from the us .
in shifting its focus from size to speed , boeing is shelving plans for a larger 747 , which was being designed to compete head-on with the a380 .
this is the airplane our customers have asked us to concentrate on .
alan mulally chairman and ceo boeing commercial airplanes while airbus has received 66 orders for its 555-seat jet , no customers have ordered the 747x , which would have carried 525 passengers .
drawings of the sonic cruiser show an aircraft unlike any other existing commercial jet , with delta wings near its tail , two smaller wings near the nose , and a pair of engines blended into the wing .
" this is the airplane our customers have asked us to concentrate on , " alan mulally , chairman and chief executive of boeing commercial airplanes said in a news release .
" they share our view that this new airplane could change the way the world flies as dramatically as did the introduction of the jet age . "
boeing says the new plane will be capable of travelling at high altitudes and meeting tough noise control measures .
airbus victory the decision leaves the way clear for the 550 seat airbus a380 to replace the 747 as the world 's largest commercial passenger jet when it enters service in 2004 .
thursday 's announcement is the end of an 11-year project by boeing to build the plane of the future for which it last year claimed it had secured £ 3bn of orders .
it is not as big but it is faster and it means airbus will have no competition in a market which is widely expected to revolutionise air travel in the same way as boeing 's 747 did when it was introduced 31 years ago .
under boeing 's plan , the current 747 jumbo jet will be modified to allow it to fly more than 8,000 miles without refuelling , and the plans for a super jumbo will be kept on the drawing board .
" in our conversations , we have received clear direction from our customers that , with continued improvements , the 747-400 family will satisfy the majority of their large airplane needs , " mr mulally said .
" we also will continue to protect the ability to do a larger 747 if and when our customers tell us they need one . "
delta-wing boeing recently said it was discussing with airline customers a triangle-shaped " delta-wing " plane that would carry about 250 passengers and cut transatlantic travel by 90 minutes compared to current subsonic flights .
boeing is experimenting with delta-wing aircraft the delta-wing plane is one of several designs included in a long-range program dubbed 20xx , which would fly farther than the current 200-seat boeing 757 and the 250-seat 767 and at higher altitude , meaning it could avoid slower-flying jets .
according to one wall street analyst , the cost of developing a delta wing plane would be $ 9bn , making it more difficult for boeing to simultaneously fund the $ 4bn 747x .
boeing may prefer to distribute its research and development spending more broadly across its defence and space product lines , analysts have said .
boeing last week announced plans to move its corporate headquarters out of seattle , where it has built airplanes for 85 years , in a move aimed at switching the focus away from its commercial aeroplane unit .
