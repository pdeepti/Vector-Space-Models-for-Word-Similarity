of women who had been clear of breast cancer for average of nine years , 42 % believed stress had been one of the key reasons for them developing the disease .
two thirds said having a " positive attitude " had helped keep them free of the disease , with 26 % saying prayer had helped them .
having some control over their condition also helps , with 58 % saying they would want to have more of a say over how they were treated .
causes identified stress - 42 % genetics - 27 % environmental factors - 26 % hormones - 24 % diet - 16 % tamoxifen , a key treatment for breast cancer patients , was identified as having helped prevent a further occurrence of breast cancer by just 4 % .
researchers from the university health network and the university of toronto carried out a study of almost 400 women , asking why they thought the breast cancer had developed , and what had prevented its recurrence .
women who believed stress was to blame , were more likely to use complementary therapies and anti-depressants , though less likely to smoke .
despite the high profile of families with a genetic link in recent years , only 27 % thought genetics was a factor , with almost the same number suggesting environmental factors had played a part in causing their cancer .
hormones and diet were also highlighted by 24 % and 16 % of the women .
but the researchers said there was less evidence to support stress as a cause than for all the other factors suggested .
positive attitude in the study , published in the journal psycho-oncology , the researchers also looked at what the women felt had helped prevent the breast cancer from returning .
in addition to the 60 % who said a positive attitude had helped , 50 % felt diet had benefited them , and 40 % praised a healthy lifestyle and exercise .
what women felt helped prevent the cancer returning positive attitude - 60 % diet - 50 % healthy lifestyle - 40 % exercise - 40 % prayer - 26 % complementary therapies - 11 % luck - 4 % tamoxifen - 4 % a third identified stress reduction , 11 % complementary therapy and 4 % luck .
half said the advice to newly-diagnosed patients would be to " have hope , have courage and be positive " .
dr donna stewart , who led the study , said the belief that stress had caused their disease , and lifestyle changes following it could help women feel they had control over the condition .
but she said it could backfire if the disease returned , with women potentially seeing it as a " personal failure " .
she added those treating women with breast cancer should take their views of how the treatment should develop into account .
" that may assist in understanding how she perceives her condition , in encouraging lifestyle changes , and in framing disease management in meaningful ways that give a greater sense of personal control . "
pamela goldberg , chief executive of breast cancer campaign , a breast cancer research charity , said : " this was a survey of just asking for people 's feelings .
" there 's no evidence to say this or that does or does n't cause breast cancer . "
and she said she knew of no research linking stress with breast cancer .
ms goldberg added women often felt breast cancer treatment - surgery , chemotherapy , radiotherapy - was something that was " done " to them .
" you feel completely hopeless and do n't really understand when you are diagnosed with breast cancer . "
and she said women placed importance on diet and lifestyle because that was something they could organise .
recommending a healthy diet , including lots of fresh fruit and vegetables , and the positive benefits of exercise , she added : " there are things you can do to reduce the risk , but there are no guarantees . "

that may not be such a bad thing , though .
here is another chance to tell the general public what his party is doing for them and how he is going to woo them ahead of a general election .
the emphasis of budgets has slowly changed since gordon brown was put in charge of the red box , believes elspeth orcharton , a tax partner with ernst and young .
she says there is less focus on business measures in the actual speech .
instead elspeth believes mr brown makes broad sweeping statements aimed at the general public and " the minutiae is contained in detailed press releases just after he sits down " .
the chancellor has around Â£ 4bn to play with this time round .
it may be enough to persuade dithering voters but the question is whether he can deliver a pre-election budget and keep his social democratic credentials intact .
the underlying strategy , believes professor wyn grant of the university of warwick , is to " give assistance to what are sometimes called the working poor . the group is essentially made up of people with families " .
with those people in mind , gordon brown is expected to increase a tax break for poorer families called the working families tax credit , and introduce a children 's tax credit at a higher rate than originally planned .
but some remain sceptical about the benefits of such a move for poorer households since many do not pay tax .
if they do , elspeth orcharton says people are often put off claiming the tax credits because the process is " a nightmare of complexity " .
minimum wage increase she says this " is restricting the effectiveness of what it 's trying to do " .
the scottish low pay unit favours measures which are handed out to the lower paid workers with no questions asked .
the government announced this week the national minimum wage would rise in october to Â£ 4.10 .
peter kelly of the low pay unit welcomes the increase but would like to see more .
he says that if the unemployed are to be encouraged back into the labour market " then there must be true incentives for lower paid workers " .
a widening of the lower 10p income tax band may help and that is one of the measures widely tipped .
he may hail it as a tax cut for all , but it would help those on lower incomes most .
among the main beneficiaries of the budget are expected to be mothers , who are an important group for labour but who have become disillusioned with the government during its first term , according to many political observers .
mr brown is expected to raise the flat rate of maternity benefit and extend maternity leave , and he may even hand out a baby bonus worth several hundred pounds for the parents of newborn children .
pre-election surprise much of the suspense has been removed from the budget with measures already announced to calm the more vociferous voices .
in november it was announced pensions were to rise and fuel duty was to be cut .
but there will of course be some rabbit pulled out of the hat .
in the pre-budget statement it was a rise in the cold weather payment for pensioners ; last year it was the cut in the basic rate of tax .
as this is a pre-election budget , the rabbit is likely to be a thumper .
given the fidgety nature of gordon brown 's budgets it could be well past the general election before any of us work out whether we really are better off .

he has enough cash to offer significant tax cuts as well as giving help to his target groups - pensioners and families .
and he knows that whatever he does could set the seal on the government 's chances at the next election , which is still expected on 3 may .
too much spending will attract accusations of pre-vote bribery and could stack up problems during a second labour term .
but a failure to help those groups who have felt most let down by new labour could spread disillusion and - the thing that alarms prime minister tony blair most - voter apathy .
so the chancellor will have to pull off a careful balancing trick if he is to boost a pre-election feelgood factor without appearing profligate .
big winners what is already certain is that pensioners and families will be big winners .
he promised to help them in his pre-budget statement with single pensioners getting an extra Â£ 5 a week with an extra Â£ 3 coming in april 2002 .
similarly , he has already announced the creation of the child tax credit which will replace the married couples allowance next month .
it will give families at least Â£ 8.50 a week and the chancellor has already indicated he might increase it in the budget .
and it is highly likely there will be more for pensioners and families in his package .
what few expect him to do , however , is to offer across-the-board tax cuts or to reduce fuel tax duty beyond the one-off cut already announced .
he has plenty of scope to reduce the 22p basic rate of income tax , but has already insisted there will be no such cuts .
it is far more likely he will offer targeted tax cuts to reassure middle england while helping the worst-off .
some are speculating that he will extend the lower 10p tax band in a bid to help lowest earners .
baby bonus mr brown is said to be planning a series of measures to help the family , including a " baby bonus " worth several hundred pounds for the parents of new-born children .
mr brown has also emphasised his desire to encourage enterprise and investment and he has been looking at measures such as extending tax breaks for research and development to larger firms .
among other measures to have featured in pre-budget speculation is the abolition of betting tax , to be replaced by a levy on the profits of bookmaking firms - many of which have located their betting operations overseas .
motorists are expected to do well out of the budget , with confirmation of a two pence cut in duty on low-sulphur petrol and cheaper tax discs for more small cars .
the opposition parties have already mapped out their likely ground for attack .
shadow chancellor michael portillo has claimed that , whatever tax cuts mr brown offers , they will be tiny compared to the " stealth taxes " he has already imposed .
" after taxes and inflation , the money that households have left to spend grew each year by just under 3 % under the last conservative government , " mr portillo said .
" under this government , it has shrunk to just over 2 % .
mr brown 's stealth taxes are robbing people of their own hard-earned income .
the chancellor can make cuts in taxes now , but only because he has overtaxed us michael portillo " the chancellor can make cuts in taxes now , but only because he has overtaxed us , " mr portillo said .
treasury chief secretary andrew smith hit back , saying : " everyone knows michael portillo 's economic policy has no credibility and no-one one will trust anything he says on tax , spending or the economy .
" when michael portillo was at the treasury the tories broke their promises on tax 22 times . "
the liberal democrats have also urged the chancellor not to cut taxes when essential services , particularly education , are in need of massive investment .
a tory think tank has accused the chancellor of imposing 45 new " stealth " taxes , raising a net Â£ 36bn over the past four years .
the financial times reports the centre for policy studies as saying labour had raised a net Â£ 28bn in extra taxes from individuals over four years and Â£ 8bn from business .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- zero interest rates back on agenda low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 7 march , 2001 , 06:40 gmt zero interest rates back on agenda governor masaru hayami : " pessimism seems to overwhelm japan 's economic outlook " the bank of japan may readopt the controversial zero interest rate policy in an effort to boost the country 's ailing economy , governor masaru hayami has said .
in a speech to journalists , mr hayami hinted that evidence that the country 's economic recovery is failing may prompt the bank to readopt a policy which saw the country operate with an interest rate of 0 % for 18 months .
" to decide whether to take such steps , we would like to watch price and economic conditions for a while , " mr hayami said .
the comments follow a series of data revealing that the economy , which in the autumn had looked set to begin recovering from its worst slump in 50 year , was hovering on the verge of recession .
the country has reported its first trade deficit in four years , and consumer demand is sliding , while unemployment is at its highest level since the second world war .
" the economic recovery is slowing further and uncertainty over economic prospects is growing , " mr hayami said .
" accordingly we are becoming increasingly cautious .
" at present pessimism seems to overwhelm japan 's economic outlook . "
but he defended the bank 's decision last august to raise interest rates to 0.25 % , the first increase in 10 years , a move critics say is implicated in the country 's economic slowdown .
the bank last month cut the headline rate back to 0.15 % , as tokyo stocks slid to a 15-year low .
" the reason the pace of recovery has slowed is not because of the end of the zero interest rate policy , but because of a sudden cooling in the us economy , " mr hayami said .
her also raised the prospect of allowing the country 's currency to depreciate , in an effort to boost exports and restore the trade balance .
" intervening in the markets and driving down the yen is another policy idea . "
but the bank would need to consider the downsides of depreciation , " such as higher import prices and the negative impact on asian economies " .

judge mackie pierce , sitting in arkansas on tuesday , asked that the girls - who are currently in the care of flintshire social services should be sent back to the us .
he said that the international custody case should be decided in missouri where the girls were born last june .
it follows a case last thursday when another judge in st louis , missouri , ruled that the eight-month-old girls should be returned there from the uk .
alan and judith kilshaw , from buckley in flintshire , and californian couple richard and vickie allen were both claiming custody of the children .
but judge pierce said the kilshaws has not met residency requirements in arkansa and the allens had not had the children long enough for a legal claim .
the babies , who were born in st louis last june to tranda and aaron wecker , were put up for adoption through an internet agency after the couple separated .
they were adopted first by the allens , then two months later taken by tranda wecker and the kilshaws to arkansa where the couple adopted them under the state 's lenient adoption laws .
both natural parents , who live apart , are fighting for custody of the twins .
on monday tranda wecker had been due to appear before a judge , accused of breach of probation .
but the hearing was cancelled , and the court decided she would remain on probation , escaping a possible prison sentence .
ms wecker faced charges that she violated the terms of a probation order by driving while her licence was revoked .
meanwhile , the natural father of the twins has said that he consented to giving up the children because he thought it would be " best for them " .
aaron wecker told cbs news ' " the early show " that he had left it up to his estranged wife to arrange the transfer and did not meet any of the other parties involved in the case .
mr wecker acknowledged he had agreed to have the girls put up for adoption after their birth in june .
" tranda and i were separated , " he said .
" i thought at the time that was best for the girls , to join a family that are together . "
in the interview , aaron wecker claimed he wanted his daughters back , and could take care of them well .
" i have a steady job , i have a house , a lot of room , a very nice , rural setting .
i 'd just like my girls back home with me .
i think that 's the best for them , " he said .
lyn lisk , the arkansas lawyer for the american couple richard and vickie allen - who claimed they were promised the children - have withdrawn from the case after mr allen was accused of molesting two teenage babysitters .
richard allen , 49 , was charged last week with three counts of lewd acts on a child under 14 and one count of indecent exposure .
he pleaded not guilty to all charges .
last month police questioned mrs kilshaw from buckley , north wales , on suspicion of theft of travellers ' cheques .
she was released without charges .
