he told them they would receive the world 's help in building a better future once the taleban were overthrown and osama bin laden brought to justice .
the aim of the speech was not intended to encourage ordinary afghans to rise up against the taleban , but to assure them that britain did not see them as the enemy , said the foreign office .
mr straw said : " this is not a fight against islam , it is a fight against terror .
we have no quarrel with the people of afghanistan jack straw , foreign secretary " all religions value life , justice , compassion .
terrorists do not .
" we have no quarrel with the people of afghanistan .
" but foreign extremists are abusing the traditional hospitality of the afghan people .
" the taleban regime harms afghanistan and its people by protecting osama bin laden and his colleagues from justice . "
promise of help the broadcast , in pashto and other regional languages , was made on the bbc 's world service and transmitted at 0230 -lrb- bst -rrb- on friday .
mr straw said britain wanted to help build a better future for the people of afghanistan .
he promised help from the west once the terrorists were rooted out , saying britain would help provide schools , clinics , roads and secure jobs for afghans .
he said : " we want to work with all responsible afghans to bring peace to the country and to help it on the path of stable development .
" afghanistan 's friends will be generous in their help .
" our commitment to the afghan people is simple and sincere .
" you have been ill-served by those who have made your country a haven for terrorists across the world . "
his message came as prime minister tony blair and us defence secretary donald rumsfeld continued what is thought to be a final round of shuttle diplomacy before the start of military action .
mr blair spent several hours in talks with the russian president vladimir putin on thursday night .
on friday he is expected to continue to pakistan , although his office has yet to confirm this .

it will be , as all elections are , a very important election for the future of the nation and the australian people john howard earlier on friday he had visited governor-general peter hollingworth to seek approval for the date , and ask that parliament be dissolved .
the conservative prime minister will be seeking a third consecutive term in office .
mr howard has seen his popularity rise considerably since he took a tough stand over a group of afghan immigrants seeking to claim asylum in australia .
mr howard had until 12 january to call an election .
re-election hopes mr howard - who heads a coalition of his liberal party and the rural-based national party - had been under pressure from the opposition labor party earlier in the year .
labor leader kim beazley had gained ground on issues such as taxation and high fuel prices .
but when mr howard refused to allow a boatload of afghan asylum-seekers land on the australian outpost of christmas island , he saw his ratings rise dramatically .
a subsequent deal saw the group taken to nauru and new zealand , with australia paying the costs of processing their asylum applications .
australia also gave nauru about $ 10m in aid .
mr howard now has a double-digit lead over labor in opinion polls .
security issues as well as immigration , mr howard said he would campaign on his clear support for the united states ' response to the 11 september terrorist attacks .
" i think stability and strength and predictability in the face of great economic and security challenges to the whole country " will the major issues , he said .
up to 1,000 australian military personnel have been committed to the us effort against terrorism , and mr howard has warned that there could be casualties in the coming months .
" you ca n't roll over to this kind of assault on the way we go about our daily lives and we ca n't leave the americans on their own , " said mr howard .
labor is expected to press its domestic agenda , on which it believes it has the best chance of defeating mr howard .
labor needs a swing of just 0.8 % to oust mr howard 's government .
