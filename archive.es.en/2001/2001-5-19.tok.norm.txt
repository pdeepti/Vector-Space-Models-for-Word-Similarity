on friday night rescue teams had to delay their efforts to bring out the potholers after water-pumps were unable to cope with the volume of water in the flooded caves and broke down .
a spokesman said the five men and three women were all safe and they were still confident of freeing them .
divers found the group of seven students and their instructor in an air pocket 36 hours after they were first reported missing in the cave near the town of gaumois on wednesday .
the group became trapped by rising underground floodwaters following heavy rain .
the potholers are about 100 metres from the entrance to the caves , and are being given food , water and medical attention .
all are said to be tired but safe and dry .
rescuers had hoped they would be able to free the cavers by mid-afternoon on friday .
new attempt several hundred rescue experts from switzerland and france are at the site in goumois , 20km -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- from the french-swiss border .
in a bid to lower the water level , the rescuers have deployed several powerful pumps , so that divers can get further inside the cave .
but the pumps apparently could not cope with an unexpected surge in underground water levels .
" our pumps are getting flooded out ...
only three out of 12 are working at the moment , " said eric zipper , one of the rescue workers .
rescue workers were trying to dry a section of the caves in order to bring the group back to the surface .
mr zipper said a new attempt to bring them up would be made around midnight -lrb- 2200 gmt -rrb- .
warnings ' ignored ' rescuers began arriving at midnight on wednesday after the alert was given .
experts say the cavers should be brought out the way they came , although rescuers are also digging a hole into the tunnels from above .
the potholers are all in their 20s , seven of them are student social workers from a zurich college , while one is a teacher .
they had gone on the trip to help develop their ability to face challenges in their careers .
french television reported that the group had ignored poor weather conditions and warnings from locals not to venture down the cave .

israeli bomber aircraft attacked palestinian targets in the west bank and gaza , killing at least 12 people , in retaliation for a suicide attack in a crowded shopping centre which killed six israelis .
unless there is an unconditional cessation ... it is hard to get back on a satisfactory negotiation track colin powell as palestinian leader yasser arafat prepared for saturday 's meeting of the arab league , mr powell urged leaders in the middle east and elsewhere to condemn the violence and " do everything they can to control passions " in the region .
in further violence on saturday , a palestinian policeman was shot dead at a checkpoint near the west bank town of jenin by assailants in a passing car , according to palestinian officials .
international pressure un secretary general kofi annan called israel 's military response to the palestinian suicide bombing " disproportionate " .
it was the first time the israelis had used fighter bombers against palestinian towns since 1967 .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana , uk foreign secretary robin cook and french foreign ministry spokesman bernard valero were also among those voicing concern at the escalation in the fighting .
israeli f16 warplanes carried out two waves of attacks on palestinian security and government offices in the west bank and gaza strip on friday evening after a suicide bomb attack earlier in the day on an israeli shopping centre .
the israeli prime minister 's spokesman said the use of f16 aircraft was justified by the " seriousness " of the bomb attack on the coastal town of netanya .
bomber 's town hit in nablus , the governor 's office , police headquarters and a prison were hit , causing substantial damage .
tulkarm - the home town of the young palestinian suicide bomber - was also hit .
israeli f16s also bombed the headquarters of the small palestinian naval force in beit lahia , in the north of the gaza strip .
as the violence escalated , a jewish settler was shot dead and two others were injured when the car they were travelling in came under fire near ramallah .
palestinian radio has reported that five children were wounded when israeli soldiers fired on them as they played football near an israeli guard post in the gaza strip .
israeli government spokesmen blamed palestinian leader yasser arafat 's palestinian authority for the bomb attack .
raanan gissin said the bombing was " the fruit of a new wave of incitations to hatred " by mr arafat and official palestinian media .
a spokesman for the palestinian authority condemned " the murder of innocent palestinian or israeli civilians " .
' justified by koran ' the palestinian militant group , hamas , said it carried out the attack in netanya , and has suggested that more will follow .
hamas spokesman mahmoud al-zahhar told the bbc that the deaths of the israeli citizens was " justified by the koran and justified by international law " .
sequence of events 0830 gmt : suicide bomber hits netanya shopping centre jewish settler shot dead in the west bank nablus and ramallah hit by warplanes , helicopter gunships and artillery israeli strikes against palestinian targets in gaza when asked if hamas would carry out more attacks he said : " we are expecting more aggression from the israeli side and more resistance from the palestinian side " .
the bbc 's stephen gibbs in jerusalem said that despite the calls for peace , the atmosphere is hardly conducive to a ceasefire , let alone negotiated peace .
the sixteen people , palestinian and israeli , who died in friday 's violence are all expected to be buried later on saturday .
far from being united in grief , the two sides have rarely been further apart .

it has approved a deal under which domain registrar verisign will keep control of internet addresses ending in .com , but it will have to give up control of the .org domain .
the agreement follows concerns by the us justice department about verisign 's dominance in the market and is intended to allow greater competition in the business of registering internet addresses .
although who runs the suffix will not directly affect how people navigate the internet , it could affect such things as prices for domain names .
concerns about competition the general terms of the deal were originally hammered out between the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- and verisign in april .
but is was subject to us approval , as the commerce department has the power to veto icann decisions .
domain names are key to finding websites and sending e-mail , and verisign runs databases for the three most popular domain name suffixes : .com , .net and .org , controlling 50 % of the market .
verisign and its predecessor , network solutions , have been running the domain name databases for the government since 1992 .
following this deal , verisign will keep control of the popular .com domain until 2007 and can renew its control at that point .
it earns $ 6 for each name registered .
rights to the .org domain and $ 5 million will be given to a nonprofit organization in 2002 .
competitive bidding for the .net domain will be moved up to june 2005 , six months earlier than originally planned .
antitrust clause verisign agreed that approval of the deal did not exempt it from antitrust laws .
it also agreed to undergo annual audits to ensure that it is keeping separate the business of signing up customers for the internet addresses from the business of maintaining those domains .
" it certainly provides us clarity to move forward in our business and gives us the focus we 've been seeking , " said company spokesman brian o 'shaughnessy .
critics had termed the icann deal a windfall for a large company and complained that it was negotiated in secret with almost no community input .
" i thought it would be a rubber-stamp , but it looks like it was slightly less than rubber-stamp , " said larry elrich , president of competing registry domainregistry.com.
" the only ray of hope is the fact that they agreed that they do n't have the immunity to antitrust . "

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- tram plans are discussed low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo saturday , 19 may , 2001 , 09:22 gmt 10:22 uk tram plans are discussed trams have proved to be a success in manchester a plan to bring trams back to the streets of glasgow has been discussed at a conference in the city .
the clydemetro campaign is seeking to bring ' light rail ' services to the city 's streets and existing rail lines .
the conference at the kelvingrove art gallery , organised by the scottish association for public transport , heared that light rail provides a realistic alternative to car use and can help regenerate socially excluded areas .
the £ 300m strategic plan to reduce traffic jams and ease rail bottlenecks , seeks to highlight opportunities and programmes for urban public transport to be considered by transport minister sarah boyack .
sarah boyack wants to see more trams ms boyack has stated that she will welcome light rail proposals and the scottish executive is preparing a five-year-plan for city transport strategies .
the clydemetro plan envisages a high frequency " turn up and go " network over the next five years , which would double rail usage in glasgow .
