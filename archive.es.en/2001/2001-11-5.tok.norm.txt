" this is one of the biggest orders in aviation history , " an emirates spokesman told bbc news online .
this provides confirmation of the engineering work in our facilities in the uk and later when production comes , there will be more manufacturing jobs in 2004/5 .
noel forgeard airbus chief executive the orders come as the airline industry faces a major downturn - with an estimated 200,000 jobs lost - due to the global economic slowdown and the 11 september attacks on the us .
" the timing of this order , hard on the heels of recent events , is no coincidence .
we are determined not to allow present difficulties to deflect our resolve , " emirates chairman sheik ahmed bin saeed al maktoum said in a statement .
the airline had previously said it planned to increase its fleet from about 34 to 100 aircraft by 2010 .
the order includes 25 boeing 777s worth $ 6.6bn , while15 more airbus a380 super jumbos and confirmation of an existing seven , eight a340-600s and three a330s is valued at $ 8.4bn.
" while boeing have signed only a letter of intent , for airbus these are firm contracts for the a380s .
it 's a very important deal , " said an airbus spokeswoman .
powered by rolls-royce aero engine maker rolls-royce will be a major beneficiary with the announcement of a $ 50m order for the airbus 330 engines with another $ 250m due imminently .
the emirates fleet currently uses mainly rolls royce engines but also some from pratt and whitney , a subsidiary of united technologies .
a rolls-royce spokesman said he was " delighted " by the confirmation of the orders but said they would not change the 5,000 job cuts made in october .
british benefits the deal is also a big boost for bae systems , a 20 % stake holder in airbus , and european aeronautic defence & space -lrb- eads -rrb- , which owns the other 80 % of airbus .
it -lrb- dubai -rrb- is going to be a boom city over the next 10 or 12 years in which ways that will generate air traffic maurice flanagan , emirates airline managing director wings for airbus planes are built in britain before being flown to toulouse in france for assembly .
" this provides confirmation of the engineering work in our facilities in the uk and later when production comes , there will be more manufacturing jobs in 2004/5 , " airbus chief executive noel forgeard said .
he told the bbc 's world business report : " we are in a period in which each year our world market share increases .
i think we are relatively weathering the storm . "
airbus has now collected signed orders for 70 of the 555-seat a380s , with a target of 100 by the end of the first quarter next year .
last month , airbus said they were freezing investment rather than cutting jobs .
the news is unlikely to make any difference to boeing 's decision to cut 30,000 jobs in the wake of the 11 september attacks .
" as you know , these airplanes do n't deliver until 2004 .
the workforce reduction we have announced is really to respond to the drop in production next year and in 2003 .
" unfortunately , i ca n't say that this order has an impact in the immediate future , " a boeing spokesman said .
' boom city ' emirates managing director maurice flanagan said the airline needed to increase capacity to cope with the growth of dubai as a businesss and tourist destination .
" it -lsb- dubai -rsb- is going to be a boom city over the next 10 or 12 years in which ways that will generate air traffic , through tourism and commerce , in quite a massive way , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
although traffic had dropped off in the immediate aftermath of 11 september , he added , it had now returned to normal .
" i think there has been quite a lot of over-reaction from some airlines although is easy for me to say that because we do n't have capacity on the atlantic , " mr flanagan added .
he said the company would begin flying atlantic routes in 2003 .

several species of farmland birds such as the linnet , yellowhammer and tree sparrow have seen a severe decline in numbers over the past 25 years .
one reason is thought to be the shortage of seeds for them to eat over the winter , due to the earlier sowing of crops by farmers , according to a three-year government-funded research project published on monday .
farmers ' grants the research , carried out by the game conservancy trust and the allerton research and educational trust , was based at the gct 's allerton project in leicestershire .
it indicated that many different birds feed on plants grown to encourage pheasants reared for shooting .
it found that a wide variety of farmland birds fed on seeds from just two crops : the health-food plant quinoa and kale used in livestock fodder .
dr nigel boatman , from the allerton project , said : " this work shows the value of game crops in feeding farmland birds through the winter .
it provides guidelines for developing the same principles in the form of a new ' wildlife seed mixture ' prescription which will hopefully soon be available through the countryside stewardship scheme . "

tory mp nicholas soames makes the comments in new documentary the tories : the curse of the mummy , to be screened on bbc two at 1900 gmt on saturday .
the whole hague thing was never taken seriously nicholas soames the film uncovers in detail the in-fighting in the conservative party during the hague years , especially between the rival camps of the then tory leader and michael portillo .
mr soames says mr hague got off to a wrong start : " that 's the problem with the hague fresh start , the whole hague thing was never taken seriously . "
the mp identifies the handling of a keynote speech by then deputy party leader peter lilley as a key example of what went wrong .
' cock-up ' mr lilley admits the 1998 speech , which saw him trying to bury the thatcherite legacy at the same time that mr hague was celebrating the 20th anniversary of mrs thatcher 's first election victory , as a " cock-up " .
mr soames argues : " what followed was a classic example of this not being a serious operation ...
" peter lilley stepped down ... because he 'd made a thoughtful , sensible speech which broke new ground .
" but by that stage william and his people were caught like rabbits in the headlights of a car and the whole thing went tits up . "
the documentary also records the horror felt by senior conservative figures when mr hague famously appeared at a theme park wearing a baseball cap .
' going spare ' the then tory chairman , lord parkinson , says : " i went absolutely spare .
they just seemed to me to be so juvenile . "
the intervention of lady thatcher in the election campaign later horrified senior mps .
shadow culture secretary tim yeo recalls : " we were using her like a dose of political viagra to try and excite some of our ageing supporters . "
the skirmishes between hague spin doctor amanda platell and michael portillo 's supporters are also detailed , with former shadow foreign secretary francis maude accusing her of briefing against him - a charge denied by ms platell .
mr maude says he " stamped his foot " but the programme goes further , telling how he and mr portillo confronted mr hague over dinner and threatened to resign if ms platell was not fired .
the conservative leader said if that happened , he too would resign , triggering a crisis , and ms platell kept her job .
in-fighting former shadow home secretary ann widdecombe also renews her criticism of " backbiting " by supporters of mr portillo , but the effect of ms platell 's influence is attacked by former party chairman and now european commissioner , chris patten .
mr patten tells the programme : " i 'm sure amanda platell is tremendous at public relations , but nobody would regard her as one of the great intellectual driving forces of modern politics .
" everything , it seems to me , was conducted at the sort of platell level . "
mr patten says it was " bananas " for the party to concentrate on election issues that appealed to its core vote .
loyalty warning in a warning to iain duncan smith , he says it would be " extraordinarily rich " for the new leader to expect loyalty because he was one of the maastricht rebels who " plotted " against john major 's europe policy .
" it 's a bit tricky for people like that to give emotive lectures on the subject of party loyalty , " says mr patten .
but shadow foreign secretary michael ancram says he is optimistic about tory prospects , arguing the new team has the " spark " needed to engage the public .
he argues the hague years changed the mood of a " shell-shocked " party .

in october , qatar 's oil minister , abdullah al-attiyah said there was a " strong movement " within opec to cut output to stabilise dropping oil prices .
now mr rodriguez has said a cut of 1 million barrels is " a possibility " , though he stressed that " any firm decision will be decided on november 14 . "
" opec is facing several problems : the economic downturn , oversupply and high stocks , not only for oil but also products , which has had a negative impact on price , " said mr rodriguez .
if at first you do n't succeed ...
if opec cuts output at its november meeting it will be the fourth cut this year in a bid to stem the slide in oil prices , which are down about 30 % since mid-september .
global demand for oil is predicted to shrink sharply this winter , according to the international energy agency .
but a cut in output could be politically sensitive as the world 's major economies are struggling to stave off recession .
opec 's target price is about $ 25 a barrel .
december brent crude was trading in london at about $ 19.10 a barrel early on 5 november but swiftly rose on prospects of an output cut .

paul marsden , mp for shrewsbury and atcham , is to spend a week touring refugee camps in pakistan 's border areas with afghanistan and speaking to government officials and aid agencies .
time is running out for the innocent civilians , the hundreds and thousands who are starving to death labour mp paul marsden mr marsden , who hit the headlines last month over a row with party chief whip hilary armstrong , told the bbc he was very concerned that a massive humanitarian crisis was developing .
he said he wanted to see the situation for himself - in particular , to establish whether the war was preventing aid getting through to civilians who needed it .
mr marsden is worried that war means aid is not getting through speaking from islamabad , he said he would be happy if his visit embarrassed the british and american governments into stepping up their aid efforts .
" these are innocent civilians who are caught up in this terrible conflict and then they are paying the price for september 11 .
" it is n't right and it is about time we got the food in . "
" time is running out for the innocent civilians , the hundreds and thousands who are starving to death . "
he said that aid agencies were saying that not enough food was getting through to those in need .
ahead of his trip , he warned that if he found this to be the case , he would tell ministers that they have to change their policies .
' healthy debate ' mr marsden described himself as a " critical friend " of the government and said it was " very disappointing " that there had still been no proper parliamentary debate over the campaign .
marsden : there should be more room for dissenting voices and he said it was time for the party to make room for more dissenting voices over the coalition response to the us terrorist attacks .
" we have too many politicians who simply follow the party line , come what may , it does n't matter what their conscience tells them ...
" there 's nothing wrong with a healthy debate , and questioning and so on , and getting to the root of what people really want , and representing people 's interests - that is what i 'm trying to do . "
he added that instead of the current bombing campaign , he would like to see military action governed by un rules and more strictly targeting terrorists .
" that means that you do not carpet bomb .
you send in special forces , you use the military availability but you do it under the control of the united nations as outlined in their articles ... and particularly you need to get more muslim states involved . "
clash with whip mr marsden caused a furore last month when he took the unusual step of putting on record the conversation he had had with ms armstrong .
he said the chief whip had told him war was not a matter of conscience , and had compared labour opponents of the bombing campaign with people who tried to appease hitler in the 1930s .
prime minister tony blair has since said mps are entitled to hold their own opinions on the campaign .
on friday mr marsden said he had informed his party of the trip , which is unofficial and paid for by himself , but had had no reply .

the technique was tested by a team from the center for motor behaviour in down syndrome at the university of michigan .
they found that practicing with a parent eight minutes a day , five days a week , on a slow treadmill resulted in children beginning to walk three-and-a-half months sooner than those who did not receive the therapy .
typically , babies with down 's syndrome walk about one year later than other children .
this delay can have a significant impact on their development , as they are less able to explore their environment .
treadmill practice was found to help children develop leg strength and postural control , both of which are needed to walk .
encouragement lead researcher dr dale ulrich said he hoped the study would encourage paediatricians and parents to work with children with down 's syndrome to help them learn to walk .
many care-givers are reluctant to encourage walking skills until a child masters crawling .
but dr ulrich said that is was important to work on walking as soon as possible with a child with down 's syndrome .
he said improving walking skills might help counter another problem associated with down 's syndrome children - because of lack of physical activity they tend to enter school carrying excess body weight .
the research is published in the journal pediatrics .

backyard troubles many south east asian countries do have what they call terrorist problems but they can rarely agree on how to deal with them .
both burma and laos are unhappy about thailand 's reluctance to crack down on rebel movements operating along their common border .
the pro-independence insurgents in the indonesian province of aceh - often labelled terrorists by jakarta - enjoy the sympathy of many people in neighbouring malaysia .
