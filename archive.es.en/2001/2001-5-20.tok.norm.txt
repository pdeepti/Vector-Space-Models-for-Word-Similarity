train companies are starting their full summer timetables and are promising to run four out of five services on time .
the improved service does depend on work being carried out successfully this weekend , but when it is finished passengers should face less disruption .
however , there are still problems on key intercity routes , which are not performing as well as they did before the accident .
milestone the introduction of summer timetables is an important milestone for the rail industry .
every train operator now has a full service rather than the emergency services that were brought in when the network was crippled by more than a thousand speed restrictions .
even so it does not mean an end to late trains .
the latest statistics , not yet published by train companies , show that last weekend nearly half of all intercity services were at least 10 minutes late .
railtrack says the hatfield episode has been humbling , but the whole industry now recognises the need to rebuild its image in the mind of frazzled passengers .
this has not been helped by fare rises introduced by some operators in an attempt to recoup the revenue lost following last october 's crash .
fare rises virgin trains was roundly condemned for increasing the price of its standard tickets by up to 9.8 % recently .
since then , the company has negotiated an extra £ 15m in compensation from railtrack for the disruption caused by the repair programme following hatfield .
even so , the fare increases remain in place , though virgin is offering cheaper book-in-advance fares to make amends .
other companies , such as midland mainline , are increasing fares by up to 5 % .
only virgin has so far admitted that it is passing the cost of the chaos during the past six months onto the passengers .

in turn mr toledo attacked mr garcia 's presidential legacy .
his 1985-90 term ended with the country in economic ruin .
a cocaine consumer can not be the leader of a country alan garcia " mr garcia , it is inconceivable that you speak of human rights , the struggle against corruption , against narcotics trafficking , when you have unresolved charges , " mr toledo said .
mr garcia hit back , repeating allegations that mr toledo tested positive for cocaine use after a hotel tryst with three women in 1998 .
" drugged and kidnapped " mr toledo has said that he was drugged by agents of former president alberto fujimori and possibly filmed in a sexually compromising situation .
the televised slanging match is unlikely to alleviate disillusionment among the voters .
polls suggest mr toledo is narrowly ahead of mr garcia , but both candidates are neck and neck with a blank ballot paper .
more than 30 % of the country 's nearly 15 million voters say they plan to cast their votes for nobody .
in other highlights , mr garcia pledged to cut utility rates and create more than 1 million new jobs , with economic growth of 5 % .
mr toledo , a former shoe-shine boy turned world bank economist. promised economic growth of 6-7 % by the end of a five-year term .
he also said he would double teachers ' salaries .
mr garcia only returned to peru in january after nearly nine years in exile for allegedly taking kickbacks .
the first round of elections ended inconclusively in april when mr toledo narrowly won but fell short of the required 50 % mark .
the run-off vote will take place on june 3 .
the election is peru 's first since former president fujimori was ousted for corruption last november .

the government 's position is that the citizens of israel must be defended while efforts are being made to put an end to terrorism ariel sharon ariel sharon repeated his pledge that the security of israelis was his top priority .
" we will do everything necessary and use everything we have to protect israeli citizens , " mr sharon was quoted as saying in an interview with the yediot aharonot newspaper .
mr sharon also told israel radio he would be willing to enter into political negotiations only if what he described as " palestinian terrorism " was halted .
bbc jerusalem correspondent hilary andersson says there have been rumblings of disapproval within mr sharon 's cabinet about the decision to use f16 fighter planes to bomb palestinian areas .
shimon peres , israel 's foreign minister , has been quoted as saying that this was the worst situation since the 1948 war of independence .
arab reaction the air raids - in response to a hamas suicide bomb attack on israeli shoppers - prompted the arab league to take its strongest practical measures against israel since the start of the intifada .
foreign ministers meeting in cairo recommended breaking off political contacts with israel because of the way it retaliated against the suicide bombing .
secretary-general of the arab league , amr moussa , said peace proposals put forward by egypt and jordan could not be discussed while israel continued its attacks against the palestinians .
and he called for international action against israel which on friday used bomber aircraft for the first time since 1967 against palestinian towns .
the bombings followed a suicide attack by a palestinian on a crowded israeli shopping centre at netanya earlier on friday .
only the palestinian authority is to be exempted from the recommended ban on contacts with israel , but egypt and jordan , which have peace treaties with the jewish state , would no longer be able to receive israeli envoys , nor will they be sending their ambassadors back to tel aviv in the near future .
former egyptian foreign minister mr moussa , who has been active in negotiating with israel , said : " our intention is not to talk or fall into the trap of talking about peace proposals while we see that the israeli government does not really mean it . "
strong language a spokesman for israeli prime minister ariel sharon condemned the arab league foreign ministers ' statement as " a nonsense , " the french news agency afp reported .
and in some of the strongest language used in this most recent conflict , israel 's communication minister , reuven rivlin , said his country was at war .
the arab league ministers , meeting in cairo , also adopted a resolution calling for an emergency meeting at the united nations in order to secure some form of international protection for the palestinians .
the united states has already vetoed an earlier proposal to send an international protection force to the palestinian territories .
bomber attacks on saturday , israeli helicopter gunships carried out further attacks on palestinian security offices in the west bank , despite international calls for restraint .
buildings were rocketed in the towns of tulkarm and jenin , wounding at least 30 people , and in separate incidents , three palestinians were shot dead by israeli troops .
israeli bomber aircraft attacked palestinian targets in the west bank and gaza on friday , killing at least 12 people .
six israelis had been killed by the suicide bomber at a crowded shopping centre in the coastal israeli town of netanya a few hours before .

icelandic singer bjork is said to be in talks about staging a concert at the covent garden venue in september , the sunday times reported .
a whole range of pop stars could soon be appearing on sunday nights , which is traditionally the night ballet and opera companies rest .
the opera house , which reopened in december 1999 after a £ 200m refurbishment , has been under pressure to recoup its finances and is frequently criticised for being too elitist .
broader remit its new executive director tony hall , former head of news at the bbc , is believed to be intent on broadening the remit of the venue , which is home to both the royal opera and royal ballet .
one of hall 's predecessor 's , sir john tooley , told the sunday times : " the opera house is not a sacred temple to be opened only to those who know the magic words .
" it makes sense to throw it open to a broader audience and to make money in the process . "
stars who would be welcome to perform at the opera house might include sir elton john , celine dion and barbra streisand , the newspaper said , citing informed sources .

in an editorial marking the seizure of parliament by businessman george speight and a group of armed supporters , the fiji times said that key questions about the events of a year ago remained unanswered .
the identities of those faceless cowards who instigated the hostage-taking and supported speight throughout are still a mystery fiji times " everyone , it seems , is still in the dark and deliberately kept there either by the bureaucracy or the very people who , in a moment of madness , set this nation back by decades economically and socially , " the paper said .
" the identities of those faceless cowards who instigated the hostage-taking and supported speight throughout are still a mystery . "
government mps were held captive for 56 days following the seizure of parliament .
during that time the military declared martial law and the constitution was suspended .
a military-backed caretaker government currently holds power , until the conclusion of general elections .
speight , who continues to claim that his actions were in the interests of fijian indigenous rights , is being held in custody awaiting trial on treason charges .
cheated and outraged ousted prime minister mahendra chaudhry , speaking on the coup anniversary , told the french news agency afp that he continued to feel cheated and outraged by what had happened .
it 's what they did to the ordinary people of fiji that matters .
they are the main victims of the coup mahendra chaudhry mr chaudhry , the country 's first leader from the large minority indian population , condemned the " forces of racism at work backed by unscrupulous businessmen and some chiefs " .
" of course , i feel cheated ... the promise that fiji had is now shattered .
it 's what they did to the ordinary people of fiji that matters .
they are the main victims of the coup , " he said .
he also expressed concern that one year on no-one had yet been convicted for the crime .
' not ready for democracy ' underlining the continuing fragility of the political situation , caretaker prime minister laisenia qarase said that fiji was still not ready for western-style democracy .
" western democracy believes in individual freedom , individual rights , one man one vote .
so it 's quite different from our community way of life .
so all the time you will have a conflict between the two , " he said .
mr qarase said he believed that only an indigenous fijian should be prime minister at this stage of fiji 's history .
he is hoping to become the legitimate holder of the job after the elections .
but his party will be one of 20 competing for the indigenous fijian vote .
