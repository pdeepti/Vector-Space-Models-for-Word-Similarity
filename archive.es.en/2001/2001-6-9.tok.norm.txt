the case could determine the extent to which international business can be conducted on the internet .
this case presents novel legal issues arising from the global nature of the internet judge jeremy fogel it stems from a dispute over a french court ordering the california-based yahoo to remove local access to an auction site selling nazi memorabilia .
yahoo was faced with fines of up to $ 13,000 a day under french anti-hate laws after being sued by two french civil rights groups .
it withdrew the items from all its websites since it could not prevent french users from accessing the material from other country sites .
but it also filed an appeal with a district court in san jose , california , to consider whether french laws could be enforced in the us , arguing that they violated us free speech laws .
landmark ruling judge jeremy fogel ruled that because the french groups had attacked yahoo in the us , they would also be subject to counter legal measures by the internet company .
this situation is unprecedented ronald katz , lawyer for french groups " this case presents novel legal issues arising from the global nature of the internet , " judge fogel said in his ruling .
" many nations , including france , limit freedom of expression on the internet based upon their respective legal , cultural or political standards .
" yet because of the global nature of the internet , virtually any public website can be accessed by end-users anywhere in the world , " he added .
french reaction the bbc 's peter bowes in los angeles says that by agreeing to hear the case , the judge has set the stage for a legal showdown with broad implications for free speech on the internet .
the french groups - the international league against racism and anti-semitism -lrb- licra -rrb- and the french union of jewish students -lrb- uejf -rrb- , have appealed against judge fogel 's decision .
" this situation is unprecedented , " ronald katz , a lawyer representing the french groups , said .
" it cries for appellate review . "

" governors-in-charge are generally of the view that the removal of additional days and loss of remission will not have any significant operational or management consequences for the scottish prison system . "
she added that current punishments other than adas and lor , such as isolation and loss of recreation time , would remain available to prison governors while serious criminal behaviour would continue to be referred to the police for possible criminal charges .

it goes like this .
a white south african greets a black acquaintance .
" is n't it great ? " the white man says .
" we 're one people now " .
the black man replies quietly .
" yes - so are we " .
this new thinking comes from the top .
president thabo mbeki has characterised south africa as a two-nation society , still racially divided .
it is very different from the one nation rhetoric of the mandela dream time .
there is now much argument about whether mr mbeki has broken the spell of the mandela achievement or simply woken south africa up from its blissful wilful delusion .
there are two national dialogues taking place there is a suburb near where i live in johannesburg called melville .
it has a relaxed , informal atmosphere , with bars and restaurants and alternative little cafes and live music .
it is a youthful , liberal place and the people who hang out there think of themselves as progressive .
but after i had spent some time there this question occurred to me : where are the black people ?
i have come to think of melville as symptomatic of the nature of south africa .
it is a cool little neighbourhood where young left-liberal white people can go and keep feeling good about themselves and their non racist credentials without actually having to confront face-to-face the continuing sense of injustice that most black south africans feel .
afraid to speak the other day i shared these misgivings about our little neighbourhood with a black south african friend of mine .
" you know allan , " he said .
" i agree with all of that , and coming out of your mouth , it sounds reasonable and fair .
" but if i say it , if i express word for word the exact same view , it would sound to white people bitter and angry and resentful and negative and unhelpful in the great nation-building project . "
and this is the curious position south africa has got itself into .
there are certain things black south africans feel they can not say , and certain things white south africans can not say .
there are two national dialogues taking place - one black , one white - and not much traffic between the two .
a couple of weeks ago , i had a conversation with a young and successful black lawyer - a friend and supporter of thabo mbeki - who had recently returned from a business trip to uganda .
freedom without bread in this africa is not freedom at all " i realised that , even as an african person , i was more familiar with britain and france and the usa than i was with my own continent , " she said .
" and when i got to uganda , instantly i loved it .
it feels so african .
" it has a real african heart beat , an african soul .
ok nothing works there but they own it " .
so i told her about a man i used to employ in eastern zaire as a local guide and translator .
i remember one assignment in particular .
when i arrived i went to find thomas .
we agreed so many days at so many dollars , shook hands and agreed to meet the next morning .
but i could tell something was paining him .
finally , he said : " but allan , please , my kids are hungry today . "
i cursed myself for not thinking of this and of course paid him some money in advance so that he could buy food for his family .
when we talked of this later , he told me that there is an africa out there in which the price you pay for being an honest citizen is that you can not afford to put bread into the mouths of your own children .
poverty freedom without bread in this africa is not freedom at all .
it is slavery , not to a white or colonial overlord , but to a poverty so entrenched that it is inescapable .
in what sense does my friend own anything ?
as a white man can i say that and be sure i am not going to be accused of racism ?
in south africa , i do not think so .
apartheid constituted so profound an assault on the dignity of black people that criticism of almost any sort from white people is irredeemably tainted with all the baggage of white supremacy .
and yet the question : " why is africa poor and getting poorer ? " desperately needs to be answered .
in contemporary south africa it is not even possible to pose - far less answer - the question .
in the mandela years , we indulged the dream and it was blissful .
there was a miracle to celebrate and the miracle of peaceful transition to a non-racial democracy endures .
in the mbeki era , south africa - woken from the dream - is facing the reality that the past is still with us and constrains us all .

the satellite will provide telecommunications and television services to the americas , europe , north africa , and the middle east during its 13-year mission .
the launch of the satellite had been delayed by a day because of high winds .

phased out ariane 4 was put into service in 1988 .
saturday 's was the 104th successful launch of an ariane 4 rocket .
ariane 4 was built in six different versions for launches of communications satellite payloads of up to five tonnes .
this model is set to be phased out after 12 more missions , when it will be replaced by ariane 5- the most powerful rocket in the series .
ariane 5 has already flown nine missions , eight of them successfully .
the next mission of the european space agency unmanned rocket is set for 12 july , when an ariane 5 will place two satellites in orbit .

they did so before , when they elected mohammad khatami - then a relatively little known cleric - in 1997 .
the vote was a rude shock to iran 's conservative religious establishment .
but once the shock had worn off , the conservatives fought back and did much to weaken the president and block his reformist programme .
mr khatami himself has described his first four years as a " tunnel of crisis " .
he was reluctant to stand again .
no street fighter at heart , he is an intellectual , not a political street-fighter .
the rivalry between liberals and conservatives in iran is often described as a power struggle .
but in some ways it is an unusual , and uneasy , form of power-sharing .
the two camps are united in their commitment to the islamic system .
what divides them is how that system should work and , above all , how democratic it should be - how much freedom should be accorded to the media , to women , to the young .
the conservatives have been badly shaken by the khatami phenomenon .
crises ahead they have responded by fighting back - and also by trying to steal some of the reformists ' clothes .
it is a tribute to mr khatami that nowadays virtually everyone speaks about democracy and reform - though each faction interprets these things in its own way .
but further crises , further confrontations , seem certain to lie ahead .
a handsome victory for mr khatami will not resolve the inherent contradictions in iran 's political system .
on the contrary , it may serve to intensify them .

ms bhutto , who has been living abroad in self-imposed exile , was convicted under a special anti-corruption law introduced by the military government .
the law explicitly states that if a person deliberately avoids appearance in a corruption case , he or she can be declared an absconder and sentenced to serve a maximum period of three years in jail .
general musharraf introduced the law handing down his decision , the special court 's judge said that several notices had been issued for ms bhutto to appear in connection with a corruption case , but she had failed to do so .
the judge said it was clear the former prime minister had been avoiding appearing in the case and was thus guilty of subverting the proceedings .
the court accepted the prosecution 's request to sentence her to the maximum three years ' rigorous jail term .
possible extradition the judge further said in his order that , since ms bhutto was not present before the court , a perpetual warrant of arrest should be issued .
legal experts say this might give the authorities the legal basis to approach a foreign government to seek her arrest and extradition .
earlier this year , pakistan 's supreme court had set aside a lower court 's judgement against ms bhutto in a corruption case and ordered a retrial .
but the military authorities soon filed several more cases of corruption against her .
the latest court verdict does not mean that ms bhutto has been found guilty of corruption .
but after being sentenced to a long jail term , she might have to further delay her return to the country .

the extrovert londoner entered the house at about 1330bst on saturday , after being chosen by the public in a vote on 1 june .
he arrived just hours after 33-year-old teacher penny became the first housemate to be evicted .
his nine housemates seemed delighted to have a new arrival , crowding around to welcome him and cracking jokes .
josh joined one day after penny was evicted josh , wearing shades , a white t-shirt and a dark jacket , said he was hoping the experience would be a " bit of a laugh " .
he and the group then caught up on each others ' news .
the other nine had been given only a cryptic message that there was to be a new arrival .
and josh had been kept in isolation for the past two weeks , away from any news about the house .
but he had earlier promised to spice things up with " nudity , nocturnal activity and naughtiness " .
betting odds bookmaker william hill has shortened the odds on helen to be the next evictee after penny .
the " wannabe it girl " from wales , who turned 23 while in the house , had been nominated alongside penny for first eviction , with 42 % -lrb- 447,337 -rrb- of viewers voting for her to go .
helen could be the next to go she was so prepared to be thrown out on friday , that she had packed her bags in readiness .
on friday housemate narinder told her : " in the first week you came across as a nasty person , but i think i got you wrong . "
helen and stuart are now joint favourites to be the next evictee .
the high-flying married father of three was described by penny as a " poseur " - after he had said she was the only female housemate he would not sleep with .
he is the least favourite with the viewers , according to a poll on the big brother website .
dean and brian remain favourites to win with william hill , sharing 3-1 odds .
the bookmaker is also offering 5-1 odds on there being a punch-up between the contestants during the series .
