in the final quarter of last year , gross domestic product - the value of all goods and services produced by a country - rose by 0.8 % .
the figures were slightly better than expected and meant japan did not show two quarters of negative growth - widely regarded as a definition of recession .
but analysts say japan 's exports are being hit by the slowdown in the united states .
spending slump and there seems no end in sight to the relentless decline in consumer spending , which accounts for 60 % of japan 's gross domestic product .
the slump in consumer spending is a major problem financial analysts say that more important than whether japan 's economy has managed to achieve marginal growth is how the markets are performing .
share prices are low and continuing to fall in the wake of the decline in the us technology stocks index , the nasdaq , while the japanese currency has also lost a lot of value .
all these factors point to a downturn in the economy .
many analysts are forecasting that production will fall , unemployment will rise and prices will continue to drop .
but the markets seem to have shown little reaction to the political turmoil in japan .
whether or not the prime minister , yoshiro mori , steps down early , analysts say the markets believe that the current government is unable or unwilling to introduce the difficult structural reforms that most experts say are necessary to revive japan 's economy .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- dna meat tests for supermarket low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo monday , 12 march , 2001 , 07:10 gmt dna meat tests for supermarket marks & spencer hopes to implement the tests soon by consumer affairs correspondent nicola carslaw the foot-and-mouth outbreak has focused attention on the role supermarkets play in food production .
the prime minister has even suggested the big stores have farmers in an armlock .
and supermarkets have been more generally criticised for compromising safety in their quest to provide mass-market , cheap food .
now high street food retailer marks & spencer , says it has found a way to use the dna in products such as meat to reassure customers they are buying the best .
genetic fingerprint currently , the meat we buy in big supermarkets can be traced back to a particular farm .
but m & s says that soon , meat will be traceable through its genetic fingerprint to the precise animal it came from .
consumer confidence in meat has suffered the retailer has signed a deal with healthcare company whatman biotechnologies which has taken the techniques used in forensic science and applied them to food production .
once the tagged and coded animal is slaughtered , its carcass is swabbed and its dna isolated and stored on specially treated paper .
it means the retailer can gain easy access to the genetic information if there were , for instance , a resulting food poisoning outbreak needing investigation .
the system , which is still in the final stages of development , will be applied first to beef , but could potentially be used on all sorts of foods .
positive reaction initial reaction from farmers and consumer groups has been positive .
in the current climate , they say , any measure that guarantees certainty about the origin and safety of food is a major step forward .
a steak could be traced back to the original animal so for beef and other meat products , the potential is huge - for any future detection and prevention of food poisoning outbreaks .
david gregory , head of food technology at m & s , said : " the potential of this simple dna technology means we can significantly enhance the integrity of our products to standards previously dreamt of . "
it is likely that once the dna testing system is widely available , other big supermarkets will use it too .

now high street food retailer marks & spencer , says it has found a way to use the dna in products such as meat to reassure customers they are buying the best .
genetic fingerprint currently , the meat we buy in big supermarkets can be traced back to a particular farm .
but m & s says that soon , meat will be traceable through its genetic fingerprint to the precise animal it came from .
the retailer has signed a deal with healthcare company whatman biotechnologies which has taken the techniques used in forensic science and applied them to food production .
once the tagged and coded animal is slaughtered , its carcass is swabbed and its dna isolated and stored on specially treated paper .
it means the retailer can gain easy access to the genetic information if there were , for instance , a resulting food poisoning outbreak needing investigation .
the system , which is still in the final stages of development , will be applied first to beef , but could potentially be used on all sorts of foods .
positive reaction initial reaction from farmers and consumer groups has been positive .
in the current climate , they say , any measure that guarantees certainty about the origin and safety of food is a major step forward .
so for beef and other meat products , the potential is huge - for any future detection and prevention of food poisoning outbreaks .
david gregory , head of food technology at m & s , said : " the potential of this simple dna technology means we can significantly enhance the integrity of our products to standards previously dreamt of . "
it is likely that once the dna testing system is widely available , other big supermarkets will use it too .

engineers peter kennedy , 46 , from hereford , darren hickey , 27 , from thames ditton , surrey , rudi petschi , 42 , of cullompton , devon , and new zealander stan shaw , 58 , were kidnapped on 3 october 1998 .
they had been staying in the chechen capital , grozny , while installing a telecommunication system .
ruslan akhmadov , who is accused of ordering their deaths , has been arrested in azerbaijan and handed over to the russians with another wanted rebel leader , badrudi murtazayev .
the foreign office is monitoring the latest developments .
a spokesman said : " we are urgently checking these reports and are in touch with the families .
we can not say anything more and do not have any more information . "
an inquest in the uk in october 1999 ruled that the men were unlawfully killed .
the victims ' severed heads were found by a road in war-torn chechnya .
the men 's bodies were handed over to the british ambassador in neighbouring azerbaijan in december 1998 , before being put on a plane for london .
although the exact circumstances of the mens ' death remains unclear , westminster coroners ' court heard that the men had been starved of food and water , and were repeatedly beaten before being decapitated .
two of the men , both " wasting away " , showed evidence of being tied up before they were beaten unconscious and their heads cut off from behind with a large blade , home office pathologist dr iain west told that hearing .
this is without question a major coup on the part of the russian law-enforcement agencies kremlin aide sergey yastrzhembskiy three of the engineers were working for surrey-based granger telecom and one worked for british telecom .
at the time of the men 's deaths , tory mp angela browning called for an inquiry into how the foreign office handled an investigation into the murders .
the chechen suspects were arrested in azerbaijan and extradited to russia , where they were paraded on russian television on sunday .
a kremlin spokesman said ruslan akhmadov was a member of a gang that kidnapped and killed the four telecoms engineers .
the kremlin 's chief spokesman on chechnya , sergey yastrzhembskiy , said : " this is without question a major coup on the part of the russian law-enforcement agencies " .
mr akhmadov and the other detainee - badrudi murtazayev - were arrested in the azerbaijani capital baku on wednesday .
news of their arrest and handover to russia emerged only on sunday .
they are now being held in makhachkala , capital of the russian republic of dagestan , which borders on chechnya .
russian public tv said mr akhmadov was accused of having a hand in " more than 30 kidnappings - and most likely this is just the tip of the iceberg " .

representatives from the welsh development agency , welsh assembly and montgomery mp lembit opik will travel to llanidloes to discuss saving 200 jobs at the kth metal foundry .
the taskforce will focus on stimulating fresh orders for the plant .
kth is the major employer in the town , which has a population of 2,000 people .
the foundry is due to close in august with the loss of at least 150 jobs and 50 more employees could be transferred to factories in england .
kth has blamed the loss of two major contracts for a slump in orders .
assembly economic development minister mike german held talks with management and unions at the factory last month .
mr german admitted there was only " a slim chance " of the factory remaining open .
' constructive ' talks kth managing director don slintham denied claims of asset-stripping and said lack of investment in recent years and the loss of the orders made closure " virtually inevitable " .
he described last month 's meeting as " constructive " and said the company would work with the assembly and wda to try to keep the plant open .
a spokesman for the aeeu said the union was hopeful but not optimistic following the recent talks .
the job losses at llanidloes have come as a huge blow to the town , which depended on the foundry as its main employer .
the mayor of llanidloes , margot jones , said the closure would have a devastating impact on the local economy .
kth was part of sir geoffrey robinson 's transtec group before it was taken over by a midlands-based consortium last year .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- japanese stocks plunge low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's greg wood " japanese consumers are n't spending , it really does n't look very encouraging here " real 28k monday , 12 march , 2001 , 08:27 gmt japanese stocks plunge speculation is rife that prime minister mori will resign stocks in japan plunged 3.6 % on monday to their lowest level in 16 years .
the fall in the stock market followed confusion over whether president yoshiro mori would resign , a sharp fall on the nasdaq last friday and concerns about the economy .
monday 's fall came despite the better than expected growth figures shown by the release of japan 's latest gross domestic product figures .
in the last quarter of 2000 , the economy managed to avoid a recession by growing 0.8 % , slightly better than expected .
but the news failed to boost the stock market as tokyo 's blue-chip nikkei-225 index closed down 456.53 points at 12,171.37 .
it was the nikkei 's lowest finish since 23 april 1985 , when it closed at 12,124.14 .
surprise growth economists surveyed by the news wire dow jones had forecast that the japanese economy would grow at a slower rate of 0.6 % .
in the third quarter of 2000 , the economy declined by 0.6 % .
that had been the first quarter of contraction since october-december 1999 .
two successive quarters of contraction would have pushed the country into recession .
the growth in the fourth quarter has been attributed to a 6.8 % increase in business investment since the previous quarter .
however , consumer spending - a key factor needed to drive the economy - dropped 0.6 % for the quarter .
previously consumer spending had merely been flat .
fears of recession economists also remain concerned about the impact of the us slowdown on japan , which sends many of its exports to america .
the japanese economy minister taro aso said it was " hard to feel at ease " about the future of the economy .
" these figures are n't recessionary , but i think a recession is probably coming , " added peter morgan of hsbc securities .
last week the japanese government announced it would set up a private-sector investment fund to buy cross-shareholdings held by japanese banks .
the plan was yet another attempt by the tokyo government to reform the country 's ailing banking sector and help boost the economy .
rumours that prime minster mori will resign remain rife .
on saturday , mr mori told parliament he would bring forward elections for the leadership .
stock slide the selling of japanese technology stocks drove the decline on the markets .
in new york , the dow jones industrial average plummeted 213.63 to 10,644.62 on friday .
the technology index nasdaq slipped 5.3 % to 2,052.78 , its lowest close since 17 december 1998 .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- farmers braced for more outbreaks low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's richard bilton " once established in an area , it -lsb- foot-and-mouth -rsb- can be moved by people " real 56k monday , 12 march , 2001 , 08:58 gmt farmers braced for more outbreaks farmers leaders predict the crisis will escalate this week farmers are bracing themselves for further cases of foot-and-mouth outbreaks .
sunday saw the biggest jump in cases in a 24-hour period since the crisis began , with 25 new outbreaks bringing the total in the uk to 164 .
by monday morning , that figure had risen to 169 .
the government is under increasing pressure to contain the disease but has rejected suggestions that the system is overwhelmed by the number of carcasses that need to be destroyed .
the national farmers ' union -lrb- nfu -rrb- says it believes the number of cases will rise rapidly during the week .
however careful you are , you can not be certain you 've not spread the disease farmer carola godman-law so far 114,082 animals have been slaughtered and another 30,739 are scheduled to be destroyed .
despite sunday 's number of new cases , agriculture minister nick brown said he was " absolutely certain " that the crisis was under control .
conservative agriculture spokesman tim yeo said the situation was approaching a " national emergency " .
he wants the army to be called in to help with incinerating animal carcasses left lying in fields .
mr yeo contrasted the government 's response to the crisis with the response in the irish republic and france , where " drastic " preventative measures had protected both countries from an outbreak .
nearly 500 vets are dealing with the disease in the uk , including experts from the united states , australia and europe .
the new cases were nine in cumbria , four in devon , three in scotland , two in county durham and single cases in kent , powys , worcester , derbyshire , gloucester , tyne and wear , and herefordshire .
tim yeo : britain faces a national emergency farmers in sussex are concerned that a racing fixture at plumpton on monday could bring the disease to their county , as yet unaffected .
the ministry of agriculture , fisheries and food and the british horse racing board have given the all-clear for racing to go ahead as long as disinfecting precautions are in place .
but chairman of the south of england agriculture society , carola godman-law , who farms near plumpton racecourse , said a temporary ban on racing across the uk should be imposed while the crisis continued .
" the local farmers around here are dismayed and quite frankly very frightened that racing will take place at plumpton , " she said .
she said allowing the event risked the disease being brought into sussex on horses , horse-boxes , lorries and race-goers .
" what most people do n't understand is that this is the most virulent disease known to man , " she told radio 4 's today programme .
outbreaks are ' no suprise ' outbreaks across the uk include 39 in cumbria , 26 in devon , 22 in dumfries and galloway , 12 in county durham , 10 in tyne and wear and eight in essex .
since the beginning of the crisis a total of 897 premises have been placed under restrictions .
gloucestershire recorded its first case at a farm in blakeney in the forest of dean on sunday .
the county 's nfu representative , jan rowe , told bbc radio 5live that he was horrified but not surprised by the development .
he said gloucestershire was surrounded by counties already affected by the disease and that it was on either side of the forest of dean .
we pray that it does n't get out into the livestock in the forest nfu spokesman jan rowe " we pray that it does n't get out into the livestock in the forest , " he said , adding that the number of wildlife in that area complicated attempts to contain the disease .
an eight-mile exclusion zone was set up around the first farm in kent to be hit by the crisis .
a total of 72 cattle were destroyed at newhall farm at allhallows , near rochester .
local farmer kathy macclean , who lives two miles from the latest kent outbreak , said it was " emotionally devastating " .
she said : " this is a beef herd my husband has built up for years .
he 's a brilliant stockman , respected all over the county and here we are two miles from foot-and-mouth . "
on sunday , animals were slaughtered at what is believed to be britain 's first organic farm with foot-and-mouth disease at venny tedburn in devon .

just before ten o 'clock peter mandelson emerged from his constituency home in hartlepool to proclaim that sir anthony 's report had established that he " did not lie , did not deceive and did not set out to mislead " - though of course , the report actually finds there is no evidence on the matter .
nevertheless , mr mandelson went on to express his gratitude to sir anthony for " clearing my name and restoring my reputation " .
downing street seemed to endorse that verdict by declaring that he could now get on with the rest of his life without a stain on his character .
unasked yet for that very reason , the report is strangely unsatisfying .
having established that the awarding of passports to the two hinduja brothers , gp and sp , was entirely above board , and that no one sought to exercise any undue influence over the decisions , sir anthony left one huge question not just unanswered , but apparently unasked .
why on earth was peter mandelson driven from office on such flimsy evidence ?
sir anthony 's report makes clear his acceptance that peter mandelson 's belief that he had not had a telephone conversation with the home office minister mike o 'brien about the passport application of sp hinduja , was honestly held though sir anthony concludes that the telephone conversation probably did take place .
after alistair campbell in a press briefing , and chris smith in the house , had given - they said unwittingly - misleading versions of the story , based on peter mandelson 's recollection of events , the former northern ireland secretary came under intense pressure .
unworthy this muddle - based superficially on a row about what sir anthony hammond describes as " a telephone call unworthy of such attention " - makes it all the more surprising that mr mandelson was forced to resign .
sir anthony has nothing to say about the final act in the drama .
the prime minister too has refused to be drawn on the question describing mr mandleson 's resignation as " over and done with " and " past history " .
when peter mandelson spoke to sir anthony hammond , he was accompanied by jonathan caplan qc .
in the light of sir anthony 's conclusions mr caplan told the world at one that he believed mr mandelson 's departure was the result of the prime minister arriving at a decision based on a version of events assembled by home office and number ten officials that on closer examination proved to be incorrect .
erroneous indeed he describes the decision to force mr mandelson to resign before an inquiry as an erroneous judgement and one which , were the case to be heard in the civil courts , would be construed as constructive dismissal . ^ ^ back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- feedback -pipe- ©
