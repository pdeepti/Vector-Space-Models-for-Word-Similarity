ronald dick , head of the fbi 's national infrastructure protection centre -lrb- nipc -rrb- , said worms such as code red posed a distinct threat to the internet .
-lsb- code red is -rsb- enough to cause the meltdown of the internet russ cooper computer security specialist the worm , which first surfaced in mid-july , has been mainly dormant since then , although it has already infected hundreds of thousands of systems .
experts believe it is set to spread again on tuesday night , just as the calendar enters august at 0000 gmt .
investigators do not yet know who wrote code red or where it started , though the words " hacked by chinese " which appear for a few hours on infected machines raise a suspicion that this is another development in an ongoing chinese-american war of hackers .
the fbi says it is working with experts in the united kingdom , australia and canada to try to contain the worm 's spread .
the code red program is called a worm because it can spread across networks and infect new machines without computer users having to do anything at all .
search for source law enforcement officials have asked for the public 's help in finding those responsible for the worm .
" if individuals have information about the people that have committed this crime , we ask them to come forward , " said mr dick .
mr dick also expressed concern that too many computer users thought of their systems as mere appliances , not recognizing that a computer needs " to be constantly monitored and maintained .
it functions like a living organism " .
he stressed the need for firms running microsoft windows nt and 2000 operating systems , along with the internet information services software -lrb- iis -rrb- , to download microsoft 's security update .
" we should consider it a civic duty to ensure that if you are running iis software , you have patched it , " mr dick said .
click here for links to microsoft security downloads home users running windows 95 , 98 or me are not vulnerable and machines running non-microsoft operating systems will also be unaffected .
however , even if your own computer is unaffected , code red could seriously disrupt your access to the internet .
it is " enough to cause the meltdown of the internet , " said russ cooper of security services company trusecure corp. white house web attack earlier this month , the white house changed the net address of its public facing websites following warnings that code red had infected many thousands of machines and was about to flood it with bogus data requests .
in code red 's first search and infect wave that ended on 19 july , the code red program is thought to have installed itself on more than 250,000 machines .
now , the code red program is about to launch a search for more machines to infect .
experts fear the wave of scanning this will unleash could cause problems for net users .
many anti-virus companies have now issued software that helps system administrators work out if they are vulnerable , and search for and purge the code red worm from their machines .
already two variants of the code red worm have been found .

the move follows his failure , at the high court on monday , to block the government 's controversial plan for a £ 13bn public private partnership -lrb- ppp -rrb- to run the tube .
an injunction prevented london transport commissioner , bob kiley , from releasing details of the report when he was sacked by the government earlier this month .

we believe that it is in the public interest that this report is made public transport for london spokeswoman the government believes ppp is the only way to fund the modernisation of the tube , but mr livingstone has condemned the scheme as fatally flawed .
his application - brought through his transport authority , transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- - was rejected by mr justice sullivan .
the judge ruled it was for the government , not the mayor of london , " to have the last word " .
the mayor is considering an appeal .

bob kiley : report raises ' crucial concerns ' " the court 's decision is simply that , irrespective of these issues , the government has the legal right to impose this scheme on london , " he said .
it was reported that mr livingstone and tfl were given leave to appeal , which could take place on 17 september .
under ppp , maintenance and renewal of the network including track , tunnels and signals would be undertaken by private companies on 30-year leases , while management of the system would remain the responsibility of london underground limited -lrb- lul -rrb- .

he urged ministers to think carefully before " imposing a railtrack " on london 's travellers .

" the public sector , through london underground , will continue to run the service , " he said .
" the private sector 's role will be what it does at the moment , which is most of the contracting work to put the new infrastructure in place . "

a petition has been submitted to the city council expressing concern that both controversial acts may be seen by children at the two-day glasgow festival in august .
event organisers , regular music , say they have not encouraged young children to attend .
the council said that the objections would be considered but the imposition of an age limit was likely to be a matter for the organisers .
last year 's festival attracted 60,000 revellers edward mcdonald , from the catholic charismatic renewal group , told bbc scotland on monday that both singers should not be allowed to perform at the summer music festival .
" we are making the city council aware of what is being planned here in glasgow .
our children should not be exposed to such acts , " he said .
" we find the violent lyrics of eminem and the disgusting stage show of marilyn manson totally unacceptable and we just decided to get together to do something about it .
" we plan to hold a peaceful prayer event in glasgow on the day of the concert to show our opposition .
letter and petition " we are still applying for permission to do this , but it will be totally peaceful .
we just want to protest quietly . "
mr mcdonald has submitted a letter and petition to the city council expressing fears that both performers could be harmful to young people .
the letter says : " it would be bad enough to have this duo perform in a concert with an over-18 age limit , but to allow our young children and teenagers to be exposed to such acts is completely unacceptable . "
barry wright : " youth and adult audience " but regular music , said it had not encouraged young children to attend the two day festival .
spokesman barry wright , said : " we in no way encourage young children to come .
" in fact , every single ticket that 's sent out has a letter with it that discourages under-10s from coming .
nor do we have any discounted tickets for children , so , it 's very much from our point of view , seen as a youth and adult audience . "
claims that marilyn manson and eminem may be damaging to young people have also been played down by mark robertson from events publication , the list .
" there has always been people being controversial , from elvis on the ed sullivan show in the 50s through to the beatles , " he said .
" there has always been somebody that would annoy the moral majority .
entertainment licence " marilyn manson is essentially a cabaret singer .
he puts on a show .
so does eminem .
that 's what they 're there for .
" they 're there to entertain and i do n't think for a minute that they 're the cause of any of society 's ill . "

a petition has been submitted to the city council expressing concern that both controversial acts may be seen by children at the two-day glasgow festival in august .
event organisers , regular music , say they have not encouraged young children to attend .
the council said that the objections would be considered but the imposition of an age limit was likely to be a matter for the organisers .
edward mcdonald , from the catholic charismatic renewal group , told bbc scotland on monday that both singers should not be allowed to perform at the summer music festival .
" we are making the city council aware of what is being planned here in glasgow .
our children should not be exposed to such acts , " he said .
" we find the violent lyrics of eminem and the disgusting stage show of marilyn manson totally unacceptable and we just decided to get together to do something about it .
" we plan to hold a peaceful prayer event in glasgow on the day of the concert to show our opposition .
letter and petition " we are still applying for permission to do this , but it will be totally peaceful .
we just want to protest quietly . "
mr mcdonald has submitted a letter and petition to the city council expressing fears that both performers could be harmful to young people .
the letter says : " it would be bad enough to have this duo perform in a concert with an over-18 age limit , but to allow our young children and teenagers to be exposed to such acts is completely unacceptable . "
but regular music , said it had not encouraged young children to attend the two day festival .
spokesman barry wright , said : " we in no way encourage young children to come .
" in fact , every single ticket that 's sent out has a letter with it that discourages under-10s from coming .
nor do we have any discounted tickets for children , so , it 's very much from our point of view , seen as a youth and adult audience . "
claims that marilyn manson and eminem may be damaging to young people have also been played down by mark robertson from events publication , the list .
" there has always been people being controversial , from elvis on the ed sullivan show in the 50s through to the beatles , " he said .
" there has always been somebody that would annoy the moral majority .
entertainment licence " marilyn manson is essentially a cabaret singer .
he puts on a show .
so does eminem .
that 's what they 're there for .
" they 're there to entertain and i do n't think for a minute that they 're the cause of any of society 's ill . "

speaking outside brisbane magistrates court , she told reporters : " i am bitter , i am upset by all this , especially leading into an election ... when i am running for the senate .

the professional association -lrb- pat -rrb- of teachers urged parents to take more responsibility for their children 's education as " first educators " .
i very much regret the increasingly common public assumption that schools , and therefore teachers , have created our nation 's ills and yet at the same time hold the key to their healing geraldine everett , pat chairman parenting was an intrinsic factor in children 's development , national chairman of pat geraldine everett told delegates gathered for the association 's annual conference in cardiff .
parents had the greatest contact with the child and their role and responsibilities must be acknowledged , ms everett said .
" i very much regret the increasingly common public assumption that schools , and therefore teachers , have created our nation 's ills and yet at the same time hold the key to their healing , " she told conference .
" the profession can not and should not be held entirely responsible for the moral failure of society at large - it can not and should not be expected to repair all the damage from the breakdown of family relationships , or the crime and corruption in our midst .
family values " it seems that the remit for teachers has developed exponentially as we have witnessed increasing violence , the decline in family values , the adverse role model influence from some areas of sport , the media and those in public life . "
" teachers were caught up in a stream educational initiatives " and yet were expected to deliver academic and moral excellence .
geraldine everett urged parents to fulfil their role and responsibilities " we can not work in isolation but in tandem with children 's first educators - we should not be designated as substitutes while others abrogate responsibility , " she said .
private funding ms everett also questioned the use of private funding in education .
" the steady infiltration of private business into education is quite likely to lead to a greater emphasis on profit and loss - profit for the businesses and loss for education , " she told delegates .
such privatisation of state schools ran roughshod over the profession .
" somehow i am left with a sneaking feeling that the new initiatives are less to do with benefiting pupils and more to do with rhetoric and placating the electorate , more akin to putting expensive wallpaper over the cracks than ensuring that the foundations are secure , " she said .
as-level chaos the " fiasco " of the introduction of the as-level curriculum had been a mess and young people now faced too many exams and tests , ms everett said .
whatever the spin put on it , the fact remains that we have a serious recruitment and retention problem ms everett " over-examining damages not only the players but has an adverse effect on the curriculum as a whole , squeezing out creativity and play . "
ms everett also drew attention to the issue of recruitment and retention in the profession .
the pat conference finishes on thursday .
the school standards minister , stephen timms , and the shadow education secretary , theresa may , are expected to speak at the conference .

the gene in question normally defends the body from cancer .
but researchers from yamagata school of medicine in japan found that the gene was switched off in over a third of the breast tumours they tested .
this gene could now be a valuable target for breast cancer drugs of the future dr gen tamura if scientists can confirm the importance of the gene - called adenomatous polyposis coli -lrb- apc -rrb- - in breast cancer , the discovery might lead to earlier detection of the disease , better treatments , or even ways of preventing it from developing .
previous studies had failed to find a genetic link between bowel and breast cancer , because the apc gene is inactivated in different ways in the two diseases .
diferent mechanisms in bowel cancer , the dna sequence of the apc gene is often mutated so that it reads incorrectly .
however , in breast cancer the gene is left intact , but is switched off by a chemical process called dna methylation .
tumour cells often use methylation to switch off genes that protect the body from cancer .
but scientists are now hopeful that drugs to reverse the process could be a potent way of treating or preventing the disease .
team leader dr gen tamura said : " we already knew the apc gene was important in bowel cancer , but to find that it 's switched off in so many breast cancers is really exciting .
" this gene could now be a valuable target for breast cancer drugs of the future . "
the apc gene is known as a ' tumour suppressor ' because it acts as a brake to prevent cells from dividing out of control .
when the apc gene goes wrong , the brake is removed , clearing the way for cancer to develop .
two genes a healthy person needs two apc genes - one from each parent - to be properly protected from tumours .
if someone is born with a damaged apc gene , they often go on to develop an inherited form of bowel cancer called familial adenomatous polyposis .
in this disease , the inside of the gut wall becomes lined with precancerous polyps - putting the person at a much higher risk than normal of developing a fully blown tumour .
the apc gene is also often mutated in non-inherited forms of bowel cancer .
in breast cancer , only about 6 % of tumours have mutant copies of apc .
however , dr tamura still suspected that it might be important in the development of the disease .
his team tested 50 breast tumours to see if their apc genes had been switched off by methylation .
in 18 of the 50 , at least one of the two apc genes was turned off .
the researchers also tested 21 healthy tissue samples , and found that in these apc was never switched off .
dr tamura sadi : " the fact that we only found inactivation of apc genes in breast tumours , and not in normal tissue , suggests these changes are specific to the disease and may be important in its development . "
professor gordon mcvie , director general of the cancer research campaign , said : " each type of cancer is different , but some of the underlying genetic causes are common to many forms of the disease .
" finding these key genes is one of the prime aims of the current genetic revolution , and will pave the way to the next generation of anti-cancer drugs . "
the research is published in the british journal of cancer .
