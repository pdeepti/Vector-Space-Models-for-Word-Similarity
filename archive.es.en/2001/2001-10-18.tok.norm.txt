they are well known for their rather unique opinion on what to wear , including a collection of hats made to look like a spiky , punk hairstyle , white motorbike trousers with neon green padding , and a penchant for incorporating folkloric motifs from the alps .
nevertheless , emulgator is becoming increasingly well-known and popular , not only among berlin 's more fashion conscious generation but also outside the city .
whether eisdieler or thatchers , berlin 's expanding fashiion scene represents an aspect of berlin which no other european capital matches : the pace of its architectural and social change .
today , the results of the city 's creative fashion minds appear softer , and less utilitarian - suggesting that berlin may well be maturing .
if anything , the city has become more sophisticated .
mitte , the place to be seen in current-day berlin , attracts designers and gallery owners , and in the meantime , numerous tourists too .
an increasing number of the more trendy fashion designers are leaving the area , moving to the neighbouring district of prenzlauer berg , drawn by the area 's diversity .
berlin 's designers , well aware of the city 's fashion heritage are looking to the future , not to the past and are selling internationally .
bund , who presented her first berlin collection four years ago , already sells in stockholm , copenhagen and barcelona .
thatchers sells in tokyo , lille and paris .
other designers are following suit .
slowed down by decades of war and separation , berlin is catching up on the fashion scene , with all the signs pointing towards commercial success . back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links externer link : berlin tourismus marketing - fashion in berlin picture of the day dw-tv europe live im focus - dokumentationen und reportagen we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

for today 's fashion conscious , it 's back to the eighties , whether in new york , london , or paris .
berlin may be a fast-moving , trendy place to visit , but it 's not new york , and when it comes to fashion , not paris or milan either .
since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , however , the city has experienced a surge of creative energy that may help it earn back its once-held status as an international fashion capital .
at the turn of the century , designers centred around hausvogteiplatz , just a stone 's throw away from the upmarket friedrichstrasse , produced some of europe 's most stylish fashions .
mostly jewish , the industry was destroyed by the nazis , along with the people that powered it .
in a sign of growing interest in its fashion heritage , the city unveiled a plaque last year commemorating the area 's contribution to a craft that in 1914 boasted 260 boutiques , 4,2000 designers and 50,000 tailors .
today , berlin fashion is streetwise , inspired by the surge in music , design and clubbing which took off in backyards shortly after the fall of the wall .
proud of having survived the turmoil of unification and inspired by the clash of two so very different realms , berlin is facing the world with a newly-found self-confidence , its fashion attracting increasing international attention .
there are now seven fashion schools and 1,500 designers in the capital working for an industry worth 657 million marks -lrb- $ 283 million -rrb- .

her partner francesco lipari designed his latest collection " electro bund " while composing music under the same name .
" electro bund " , a new collection of trendy , brightly coloured clothing , is symbolic of the type of fashion to be found all over the city .
berlin 's designers generally tend to use a lot of colourful shiny materials , producing basic , wearable streetwear , often embellished with numerous side pockets , remnants of the days when practical clothing was important for living in a city with so many building sites .
berlin fashion is utilitarian , and often dress-to-sweat-wear , a reflection of its clubbing roots .
the average berliner is still timid when it comes to fashion , says bund .
in a city with a relatively young fashion scene , self-assurance is rare and so is risk-taking .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- breakthrough for deaf children categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 18 october , 2001 , 04:56 gmt 05:56 uk breakthrough for deaf children alice hardie has had the implant fitted doctors have perfected a quick and relatively straightforward way to restore hearing to profoundly deaf children .
it has been possible for some time to restore hearing by inserting an implant into a part of the ear called the cochlea .
but now doctors at the queen 's medical centre in nottingham have developed a way to insert the implant using keyhole surgery .
the procedure involves inserting the implant through a tiny 3cm cut behind the ear .
it causes only minimal scarring and significantly reduces the risk of infection .
the child 's hair can simply be pinned back while the operation takes place , and there are no stitches to remove afterwards .
previously , the operation was only possible through a much larger incision in the skull , which left a noticeable scar .
world first sue hardie says her daughter has made good progress it is thought that two-and-a-half-year-old alice hardie is the first youngster in the world to undergo keyhole surgery to have the implant fitted .
before the operation , alice was profoundly deaf .
but alice 's mother sue said she has since made tremendous progress .
" she can hear the phone ringing , and recognises it for what it is .
" the keyhole technique is fantastic .
my daughter went down for surgery and she came back five hours later looking very much the same as she had done went she went down .
" in fact , we were only in hospital overnight .
it was unbelievable .
" we now have every hope that alice will be able to live a completely normal life , like her hearing brother , and go to mainstream school . "
acoustic signals the cochlear implant is made of flexible silicone and titanium the cochlea is the part of the ear which transforms acoustic signals into electric signals which can be understood by the brain .
the implant uses a microphone to pick up sounds , which are then passed to a speech processor , which is worn on the body like a walkman .
this converts the speech into electronic signals which are then transmitted to a receiver implant implanted behind the ear .
a wire from this passes the signal into the inner ear and the cochlear nerve which carries it to the brain .
it restores limited but useful hearing to a meaningful level of 30 to 40 decibels .
the keyhole surgery technique has been developed by professor gerry o 'donoghue .
he said : " cochlear implants give deaf children the gift of hearing but the more conventional incision was somewhat excessive .
" technology now allows us to operate on younger and younger children , but at the same time we needed to develop a technique which reduced the psychological effects as well as the physical scarring , because this could often deter children or prospective parents from considering implantation as an option . "
the new technique is known as the nucleus 24 .
it lasts for about 60 years .
there are approximately 23,000 deaf children in the uk .
over 40,000 children and adults have cochlear implants world-wide .

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- mp 's launches legal cannabis plans categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 18 october , 2001 , 05:23 gmt 06:23 uk mp 's launches legal cannabis plans former welsh health minister jon owen jones is attempting to push through a bill to legalise the sale of cannabis .
the cardiff central mp wants to decriminalise the drug for recreational and medicinal use .
he published a private member 's bill on the issue in westminster on thursday morning after being granted parliamentary time to put his case forward .
it is working to create huge profits on which an international drug cartel works jon owen jones mp he is now set to put the bill before parliament on friday , 26 october .
but it has no chance of becoming law but mr jones he said the thirty year campaign to stamp out cannabis use simply has not worked .
" it is simply channelling billions of pounds into the criminal network which use the money to practice their nefarious deeds - including pushing harder drugs , " said mr jones .
mr jones , who narrowly retained his parliamentary seat in cardiff from the liberal democrats at the general election , has previously confessed to smoking as a student .
the mp said making cannabis illegal was sending the " wrong signals " to young people .
" when half the young people between 19 and 24 take this drug and the law says this drug is bad so they obviously do n't believe the law is wrong . "
" they are very right not to believe it because frankly the law is wrong . "
licensed joints he wants the drug licensed for sale alongside alcohol at premises such as off licences because , he says , it is less harmful than tobacco and alcoholic drinks .
he has said government policies toward cannabis were not working despite towing the party line as welsh health minister between 1998 and 1999 .
announcing his intention to put the bill forward in july , he told bbc wales : " i always thought this privately .
mr jones says many young people smoke cannabis " but my role was to mitigate against the effects of drug use rather than to prosecute people .
mr jones is to present his bill at a news conference in westminster and put it before the house later in the day .
the best the former teacher can hope for from parliament is to hold what he has called " an adult debate " on the issue of cannabis decriminalisation .
legalisation calls in the summer , conservative mp peter lilley also called for the drug 's legalisation in an effort to break the criminal link between hard and soft drugs .
mr jones said in his defence at the time : " it produces huge profits for organised crime which is able to use those profits to sell other , much more harmful drugs to people .
" it is working to create huge profits on which an international drug cartel works and that undermines civic society . "
some scientific evidence has emerged to suggest cannabis may be useful in treating a wide range of conditions .

the cardiff central mp wants to decriminalise the drug for recreational and medicinal use .
he published a private member 's bill on the issue in westminster on thursday morning after being granted parliamentary time to put his case forward .
it is working to create huge profits on which an international drug cartel works jon owen jones mp he is now set to put the bill before parliament on friday , 26 october .
but it has no chance of becoming law but mr jones he said the thirty year campaign to stamp out cannabis use simply has not worked .
" it is simply channelling billions of pounds into the criminal network which use the money to practice their nefarious deeds - including pushing harder drugs , " said mr jones .
mr jones , who narrowly retained his parliamentary seat in cardiff from the liberal democrats at the general election , has previously confessed to smoking as a student .
the mp said making cannabis illegal was sending the " wrong signals " to young people .
" when half the young people between 19 and 24 take this drug and the law says this drug is bad so they obviously do n't believe the law is wrong . "
" they are very right not to believe it because frankly the law is wrong . "
licensed joints he wants the drug licensed for sale alongside alcohol at premises such as off licences because , he says , it is less harmful than tobacco and alcoholic drinks .
he has said government policies toward cannabis were not working despite towing the party line as welsh health minister between 1998 and 1999 .
announcing his intention to put the bill forward in july , he told bbc wales : " i always thought this privately .
" but my role was to mitigate against the effects of drug use rather than to prosecute people .
mr jones is to present his bill at a news conference in westminster and put it before the house later in the day .
the best the former teacher can hope for from parliament is to hold what he has called " an adult debate " on the issue of cannabis decriminalisation .
legalisation calls in the summer , conservative mp peter lilley also called for the drug 's legalisation in an effort to break the criminal link between hard and soft drugs .
mr jones said in his defence at the time : " it produces huge profits for organised crime which is able to use those profits to sell other , much more harmful drugs to people .
" it is working to create huge profits on which an international drug cartel works and that undermines civic society . "
some scientific evidence has emerged to suggest cannabis may be useful in treating a wide range of conditions .
some tests have indicated it could help reduce side effects of chemotherapy treatment given to cancer patients .
official home office figures show a third of adults in england and wales have used the drug .

an official cuban statement said russian president vladimir putin wanted the radar base shut down as " a special present " to us president george w bush ahead of a meeting between the two men this week end .
" the agreement for the lourdes radio-electronic centre is not cancelled , as cuba has not given its approval , and russia will need to continue negotiating with the cuban government given the important issues left to resolve , " the statement said .
the loss of the base is a blow to the economy of cuba , which earned $ 200m a year in rent from leasing the site to russia .
president putin said the lourdes station , where around 1,500 russians are based , was too expensive to maintain .
russian chief of staff general anatoly kvashnin said : " it costs $ 200m a year in rent to cuba .
for that amount , we can buy and launch 20 military satellites into space . "
sore point the us welcomed russia 's announcement as another sign the cold war was over .
the base , which houses radar and electronic equipment , was a sore point in relations with the united states , which says it has been used as a centre for spying on america .
the us congress voted last year to restrict financial aid to russia unless it closed the base .
mr putin stressed the decision did not mean its relations with cuba - a key cold war ally - were being scaled down .
a naval base at cam ranh bay in vietnam is also being closed .
general kvashnin said the closures would allow russia " to resolve a lot of financial matters " .
cost-cutting the bbc 's robert parsons in moscow says the closures have come as a surprise - and only last year mr putin told the staff during a visit that their mission played a very important role in government decision-making .
the president called on us to seek ways that could save resources general anatoly kvashnin the decision , he says , may reflect the new mood of co-operation with the us since the 11 september terror attacks , although the moves will also save millions of dollars .
officials quoted by the associated press news agency said the closure decisions had been taken at a " stormy " meeting of senior military leaders , chaired by mr putin .
" the president called on us to seek ways that could save resources , including those within -lsb- the military -rsb- , " said general kvashnin .
denying the us spy claims , moscow has always made clear it sees the base as vital for checking whether the us has complied with disarmament treaties , and for monitoring missile launches .
