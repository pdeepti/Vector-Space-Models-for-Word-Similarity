immediately after the downing street dinner talks both sides appeared upbeat , describing them as full and frank but constructive .
sadly we did not make any major progress on the specifics of their proposals gmb spokesman however , it emerged that some believed little real progress was made after one union warned they were all still on a " collision course " with the government .
ministers are planning further meetings in an effort to reassure the unions over their plans for greater private involvement in the public sector , previously described by downing street as " non-negotiable " .
' no punches pulled ' speaking to reporters after wednesday 's dinner , tuc general secretary john monks appeared to sum up the prevailing mood when he said : " no punches were pulled .
the air was cleared . "
he said a " degree of reassurance for all concerned " had been provided and added that they would " now work together to give the british people the public services they deserve " .
there was agreement that we are not talking about privatisation downing street spokesman but later a spokesman for the gmb union gave a stark warning that they were still on a " collision course " for a row with labour at the party 's annual conference in the autumn .
" sadly we did not make any major progress on the specifics of their proposals , " he said .
" there was an attempt at general reassurance but there was nothing concrete to allay the fears of millions of public sector workers .
" we hope we can resolve this issue through negotiation but if that is not possible we will have no choice but to settle it on the floor of the labour party conference . "
conference threat the issue will be raised again next week at the annual conference of the transport and general workers union .
delegates are expected to reassert their strong opposition to the government 's plans .
however roger lyons , general secretary of the manufacturing science and finance union , said the meeting had brought the two sides " much closer together " .
" we have major concerns about wholesale privatisation but as a result of these constructive discussions the prime minister made it clear there was no question of this happening , " he said .
on the march : bill morris put his members ' concerns tgwu boss bill morris agreed : " we have taken advantage of the opportunity to express to the prime minister our concerns , our members ' concerns , and he in turn has indicated to us that the government is about reform in the public sector and public services but there is no wholesale programme for mass privatisation as we 've understood it in the historical context . "
a downing street spokesman said it had been " a constructive meeting " and a " useful dialogue which will continue " .
mr blair will be keen to avoid a fall-out with labour 's traditional backers , knowing that any reform he embarks on will have to take public sector workers with the government .
he has already moved to quiet fears among labour mps , warning them of public disillusionment if the government does not deliver on promised reforms in schools and hospitals .
growing criticism among the growing barrage of criticism over government plans have been two left-leaning think tanks and a number of backbench labour mps .
last week unison , the main public sector union , fired a warning shot across labour 's bows by voting at its annual conference to conduct a review of its financial links to the party - currently worth £ 1.3m a year .
the conservatives have not been slow to capitalise on the issue .
outgoing conservative leader william hague mocked mr blair at commons question time over " lurching from beer and sandwiches with the unions to canapes with the contractors " .

sheen , 60 , who plays the us president in hit tv series the west wing , was also fined $ 500 in los angeles on wednesday .
sheen was arrested in october at the vandenberg air force base in california .
he was part of a demonstration against the proposed us " star wars " military nuclear defence system .
sheen said he had to plead guilty because of work obligations but would still oppose " star wars " .
" i have a prior engagement with the west wing , another year on my contract , and i ca n't risk losing -lrb- at a trial -rrb- and going to prison for six months .
" morally , i 'm bound to fulfil my contract .
that was the whole motivation . "
under the terms of his probation , sheen is banned from vandenberg without permission from officials there .
the actor said his previous federal court experience had left him " conquered , but unafraid , " and he would continue to oppose " star wars " initiatives .
outspoken a spokesman for the us attorney 's office in los angeles said most of the other protesters arrested with the actor had pleaded innocent to trespassing charges and would face trial later this year .
earlier in the day , sheen joined his fellow protesters outside court , who were waving banners saying : " no star wars " .
sheen said : " i ca n't think of a worse thing to inflict on the universe than nuclear weapons in outer space , and all of them pointed to the earth . "
sheen , also the star of movies apocalypse now and wall street , is famous for his outspoken and proactive political views .
he has been arrested 70 times for his involvement in protests for issues such as nuclear disarmament and homelessness .
sheen , a prominent democrat party supporter , has also made known his opposition to us republican president george w bush .
in an interview with the radio times , sheen said : " george w bush is like a bad comic working the crowd , a moron , if you 'll pardon the expression . "
