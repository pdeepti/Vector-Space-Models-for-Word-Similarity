bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- stratford 's winter of discontent ?

stratford-upon-avon 's history is a valuable asset stratford-upon-avon has long been a magnet for american visitors .
six weeks ago , in the wake of the 11 september attacks , bbc news online found the town 's tourist industry badly shaken .
have things improved ?
with its half-timbered tudor houses , its picturesque waterside setting and links to william shakespeare , stratford-upon-avon has always been a magnet for tourists .
and it has always been particularly loved by americans , who make up the biggest number of overseas visitors to this bustling midlands town .
hotels have room , but that 's normal for this time of year so when americans began to cancel their holidays to europe in the wake of the 11 september attacks , it seemed life in stratford was about to change radically .
with one-third of the town 's population working in tourism , there were grave concerns for peoples ' livelihoods , especially since the foot-and-mouth epidemic earlier in the year had averted many visitors .
the impact of the attacks was felt immediately .
hotel bookings were cancelled as the ryder cup golf tournament , due to be held close by , was postponed until next year .
among those involved in selling stratford as a destination to tourists , there was widespread uncertainty about what would happen next .
better news two weeks after 11 september , south warwickshire tourism told bbc news online that marketing campaigns had been suspended .
i was pleasantly surprised because i was expecting a big fat zero alex holmes on tourism growth six weeks later , and many of these have now been re-scheduled , says alex holmes , director of south warwickshire tourism .
and the prophets of doom have been proved pleasantly wrong .
in october , figures for over-the-counter bookings at the town 's tourist information centre were , surprisingly , slightly better than last year .
" the number of visitors to the centre was 6 % up on last year and accommodation bookings were up 3 % , " says mr holmes .
american visitors have been down in number , but , on these figures , only marginally .
shakespeare , a one-time resident of stratford , is a powerful draw " it 's only a snapshot but i was pleasantly surprised because i was expecting a big fat zero , or even worse . "
the bigger picture certainly gives cause for concern .
according to the national office of statistics , visits to britain by north americans were 17 % down in september compared to a year before .
experts believe the september decline almost certainly understated the full impact , since the figures are compiled as visitors leave britain , not as they arrive .
it was likely that about half those leaving in september actually began their holiday before the 11th of that month .
' bumpy ride ' but while block bookings by american tourist groups are down 40 % at the royal shakespeare theatre , hotel owners seem to be bearing up .
" it has been a bit of a bumpy ride , " says john reynolds of the shakespeare hotel in stratford .
the real test will be the second and third quarters next year alex holmes " coming on the back of foot-and-mouth the downturn has cost us a considerable sum . "
yet there are signs that any revival will be home grown .
over the winter the hotel trade throughout the country may get a lifeline from british people who , like americans , decide to holiday at home .
" there 's been a marked increase with local people going to the theatre or having a weekend away , " says mr reynolds .
" we are packed out at the weekends at the moment . "
' better than normal ' he is more worried about the general state of the economy which , he says , could spell trouble for not just his hotel but the entire sector .
meanwhile neil gray , manager of the smaller grosvenor hotel in stratford , says business is better than normal for the time of year .
" the downturn in american trade has not really hit us at all , " says mr gray .
" our client base is mostly people from the uk .
we seem to have no problems at the moment " .
according to alex holmes , it is probably too early to pin down the real impact on tourism of the terror attacks .
" things tend to be quieter now .
the real test will be the second and third quarters next year - april to september .
that 's when tourism really takes off here . "

bbc news -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- mark durkan : pragmatic problem solver categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : northern ireland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 10 november , 2001 , 09:44 gmt mark durkan : pragmatic problem solver mark durkan : ready for challenge as sdlp leader at 41 , mark durkan has seen his political star rise rapidly as he gained the positions of finance minister , deputy first minister and now sdlp leader .
bbc northern ireland political correspondent mark simpson says it is mark durkan 's pragmatism , problem-solving ability and ease at defusing tense situations , which have so often made him the right man for the job .
in terms of politics and pastimes , mark durkan has always had green fingers .
as a young schoolboy , he enjoyed growing vegetables , and spent hour after hour in the back garden of his derry home , tending his patch of cabbages and lettuces .
it was an odd hobby for someone so young , but durkan has always been ahead of his time .
at the age of 41 , he has just assumed two of the biggest jobs in northern ireland politics - deputy first minister of the assembly , and leader of the sdlp .
he is a decade younger than the sinn fein president gerry adams , 16 years younger than the ulster unionist leader david trimble , and the dup leader ian paisley is old enough to be his father .
parallels have been made between the rise of mark durkan and the ascent of william hague through the ranks of the conservative party .
both men were tipped as future leaders at a stage when they were barely out of short-trousers .
mr hague had a brief but unspectacular stint at the helm of the tory party ; mr durkan will be hoping to do better than that .
one-liners in spite of his grooming for the leadership , he has never taken anything for granted .
in 1995 , he said : " one thing i have learned in politics is that ' up-and-comings ' always get their come-uppance . "
mark durkan : leader elect acknowledges challenge ahead the remark is typical of a man renowned for his one-liners .
he once accused unionists of treating written proposals by the british and irish governments as if they had a " textually transmitted disease " .
as finance minister at stormont , he summed up his relationship with his fellow ministers by saying : " they laugh at my jokes , and i laugh at their spending plans . "
by all accounts , the young durkan was telling jokes long before he learned to walk .
family members have fond memories of mild-mannered mark and his seemingly endless supply of laughs .
he was the youngest of seven children growing up in the pennyburn area of derry .
his father was a police officer but died in a car accident when mark was a baby .
lasting impression at the age of nine , he caught his first glimpse of the man who was to shape his political life - john hume .
john hume has groomed mark durkan to be his successor it was the time of the 1969 stormont election , and hume was canvassing around derry , using the running-board of an old volkswagen as a make-shift platform .
durkan went with his mother to hear hume speak and although much of the politics went over his head , the event made a lasting impression on him .
a decade later , hume was sdlp leader and durkan was a student at queen 's university in belfast .
' londonderry heir ' sometimes , they travelled together from derry to belfast and they quickly formed a bond that has stood the test of time .
for many years , durkan has been seen as the ' londonderry heir ' , the man most likely to fill john hume 's shoes as party leader and mp for foyle .
he has already followed in hume 's footsteps , by cultivating good contacts in the united states .
in 1985 , he worked for a short time in senator edward kennedy 's office .
also working there at the time were nancy soderberg and jim steinberg , who both later held key advisory roles in the white house during the clinton years .
in terms of character , hume and durkan are quite similar , and not just because they both come from derry .
highly-intelligent both men are highly-intelligent , extremely intense individuals , who thrive on problem-solving .
they are also good talkers .
their critics would say they are not always as good at listening , and that sometimes they have a habit of giving an enormously long answer to a question when a short one would do .
they have little outside interests in life other than politics and their families .
in what little spare time durkan has , he likes to watch manchester united .
but given united 's recent poor performances , it could hardly amount to a form of relaxation .
his wife jackie is also a member of the sdlp , and for many years they worked together in hume 's constituency office in derry .
juggling commitments nowadays , durkan has a staff of his own , as he juggles constituency work , with his responsibilities as finance minister , deputy first minister and now sdlp leader .
he is set to give up the finance minister 's job in december , once the current budget negotiations at stormont have been completed .
as durkan himself might say , from christmas onwards his responsibilities will not be as taxing .
but he still faces a difficult task , and the early days of his leadership will be watched , dare i say it , with interest .

the suspects were seized in an overnight raid on a palestinian-controlled village in the west bank .
the army also bulldozed the house of a palestinian man who was shot dead last month after he allegedly opened fire at a bus station , killing three israelis .
the incursion came shortly after united states secretary of state colin powell said he hoped to " jump-start " the peace process .
he suggested that israel had to be prepared to give up land for peace , in line with un security council resolutions .
arafat meeting mr powell said he would like to meet palestinian leader yasser arafat when the united nations general assembly convenes in new york on saturday .
palestinian sources said no meeting had been scheduled .
president george w bush has refused to meet the palestinian leader .
national security advisor condoleezza rice said on thursday that mr arafat had not done enough to distance himself from terrorism .
mr powell said the president would meet mr arafat " in due course , when the time is right " .
heavy price israel 's overnight raid into the west bank came after defence minister binyamin ben-eliezer said the killers of an israeli woman would pay a heavy price .
the 39-year-old woman was shot dead in an ambush on friday as she drove to her jewish settlement home near the town of jenin in the west bank .
the al-aqsa brigade , affiliated with mr arafat 's fatah movement , has claimed responsibility for the killing , the associated press news agency reported .
a statement from the group said the shooting was in response to a car explosion on tuesday in jenin that killed two fatah activists .

but , while the english-language newspaper carries a clear message from bin laden that he has access to such weapons , he makes no such claim in an urdu-language version of the interview .
pakistani journalist hamid mir , the editor of the urdu-language newspaper ausaf , conducted the interview with bin laden , who is widely held responsible for the suicide attacks on the united states two months ago .
dawn 's english version quotes bin laden as saying : " if america used chemical and nuclear weapons against us , then we may retort with chemical and nuclear weapons .
we have the weapons as a deterrent . "
my cause will continue after my death ... this war has been spread all over the world osama bin laden mr mir then asks bin laden where he got the weapons , which the al-qaeda leader declines to answer .
but in the urdu version of the article , bin laden does not threaten to use nuclear or chemical weapons .
" the us is using chemical weapons against us and it has also decided to use nuclear weapons .
but our war will continue , " he says , according to the bbc 's own translation of the ausaf article .
the two versions are otherwise very similar , says the bbc monitoring unit .
mr mir told the bbc he was wrapped in a blanket and taken by jeep to meet the al-qaeda leader at a location about five hours drive from the capital , kabul .
he said bin laden was in high spirits and apparently healthy , but was surrounded by tight security .
the dawn newspaper said this was the first interview given by bin laden since the 11 september attacks .
mr mir is known to have met osama bin laden in the past .
bin laden told mr mir al-qaeda 's mission was to spread the word of god , not to massacre people .
he said : " i am ready to die .
i know that they can bomb this place also .
they are not aware that i am present here .
but they are dropping bombs blindly everywhere .
so i may get killed even with you .
" but my cause will continue after my death .
they think they will solve this problem by killing me .
it 's not easy to solve this problem .
this war has been spread all over the world . "
bin laden refused to say whether or not he was behind the us attacks , describing the targets as the american icons of military and economic power .
he accused the us and its allies of massacring muslims in palestine , chechnya , kashmir and iraq and said they had the right to attack america in reprisal .
he said the whole of america was responsible for what he called the atrocities perpetrated against muslims .
when asked about pakistan 's role , he said his group was disappointed by president pervez musharraf and the majority of pakistan was against him .
video message earlier , a senior member of al-qaeda said the group remained intact despite over a month of us bombing of afghanistan .
speaking in a video message to the al-jazeera tv station , ayman al-zawrahi said what he called the jihad or holy war would not end until all american jewish troops had been expelled from all muslim states .
he accused president george w bush of lying when he said the bombing campaign had destroyed al-qaeda and hurt the taleban .
the issue of palestine , he said , was the crux of the conflict , and al-qaeda would continue to fight until what he termed " every last us jewish soldier " had left palestine , the arabian peninsula , and all muslim countries .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- residents move away from ground zero categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : americas front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 10 november , 2001 , 12:40 gmt residents move away from ground zero air quality is poor in homes near ground zero by bbc news online 's megan lane in new york once there was a waiting list to live in the neighbourhood shadowed by the world trade center .
now residents are debating whether to stay or go , and landlords are dropping rents to stem the flow .
the well-to-do residents of battery park city once gloried in their breath-taking view on the perimeter of the world trade center .
today , it literally catches their breath as smoke and dust still hangs in the air over their upscale condominiums .
" the air quality sucks , " says joshua rockoff , 25 , who rents a studio apartment just a few streets from the ruins of the twin towers .
" i wake up every day with terrible sore throats .
i asked my doctor about it and he said the only way to fix it is to move out . "
joshua rockoff used to have a view of the world trade center many of his neighbours have done just that , especially the elderly and those with families .
whereas once there was a waiting list to live in this exclusive corner of south-west manhattan , the clamour is now all but silenced .
many buildings in the 92-acre landfill site - built , coincidentally , on the dirt excavated during the construction of the trade centre - have about a third of the apartments vacant .
" the only people left are young singles who work around wall st and need to be there .
and even they are looking to move out . "
joshua himself wants to move , but not out of battery park city .
" i want to stay down here but i want to see the water .
i used to have a view of the world trade center .
now i want to see the hudson river and the statue of liberty . "
evacuated when those towers came down almost two months ago , joshua was among the 9,000 battery park city residents to be evacuated .
during the two weeks that he was unable to get back into his apartment , he told bbc news online of his plight as one of manhattan 's new homeless .
" i slept in homeless shelters , in public libraries , on office floors .
when i moved back in , this place was trashed .
the whole apartment was covered with a layer of dust .
" i had to dry-clean every single item of clothing i own ; i had to dry-clean my whole bed ; my laptop and dvd player were ruined ; my computer was full of dust .
and the place just smelled . "
battery park city rental prices standard one bedroom flat , pre-11 september : $ 2,900 standard one bedroom flat , post-11 september : $ 2,000 for those like joshua who remain - and those lured in by reduced rents - grim reminders of the terror attacks abound .
on their doorstep is the massive excavation site that is also a crime scene and the resting place for thousands whose bodies have yet to be recovered .
by day , lorries rumble past carrying rubble and twisted girders to refuse barges , by night floodlights illuminating the site spill a bright glow into the streets .
and each day brings a stream of tourists eager to see the devastation with their own eyes .
" the trees are being cut down in case they are poisoned , the sidewalks are ripped up , there 's a police officer on almost every corner .
i could leave my wallet in the middle of the street and no-one would dare touch it . "
homecoming but some aspects of life in battery park city are slowly returning to normal .
residents no longer need to negotiate up to four police checkpoints - some requiring two forms of id - just to get home .
the shops and restaurants lining the once-quiet streets have reopened .
most have " welcome home " signs and community notices advertising counselling sessions for those who witnessed the carnage .
shops and restaurants have reopened the nearest subway station reopened almost two weeks ago - but it is so close to the ruins that that staff wear face masks and commuters can smell ground zero when the train doors slide open .
when the cars rattle under the site , a respectful silence descends among those riding the cars .
it may sound a cliché , but those living so close to such adversity have rediscovered their community spirit .
" nobody talked to their neighbours before 11 september , " joshua says .
" now we talk all the time .
people knock on my door to watch football games or to borrow a cup of sugar .
i thought that only happened in the movies . "

in a rare glimpse into the investigation , agents say they have built up a psychological and linguistic profile of the culprit .
he lacks the personal skills necessary to confront others fbi profile of anthrax sender the announcement came as president george w bush ordered security to be beefed up at airports for the holiday season , which begins with thanksgiving on 22 november .
tom ridge , the us homeland security director , said on wednesday he was " hopeful " that the anthrax outbreaks were over but another four postal facilities in new jersey have since tested positive for the disease .
the fbi say they have not ruled out links with a terrorist organisation , but behavioural and linguistic evidence points to - as they put it - an opportunist of domestic origin .
at least three letters containing anthrax spores have been sent since the 11 september attacks on new york and washington .
four people have died , two of them postal workers .
inexpensive equipment the letters were posted on 18 september and 9 october .
the fbi say the suspect is probably an adult male who may have referred to the us attacks in his messages only as a decoy .
he may have no more scientific knowledge than a lab technician and his equipment need not have cost more than $ 2,500 .
he could have set it up in his garage , or in his attic .
he is , agents believe , a loner , someone not given to face-to-face confrontation , nor , as they put it , to speeding through stop signs .
he is rational and methodical but " lacks the personal skills necessary to confront others " .
bbc washington correspondent tim franks says the fbi hopes that its detailed analysis of the culprit will prompt a friend or relative to tip them off .

about 20 us post offices have tested positive for anthrax and thousands of postal workers have been put on preventive antibiotics since the outbreak began .
on friday , president bush ordered america 's states to put an additional 2,000 national guardsmen on guard at airports for the thanksgiving / christmas holiday period .
he confirmed that 6,000 guardsmen had already been deployed at airports since the 11 september attacks .
their duties include monitoring passengers and screening baggage , as well as guarding airport facilities .
" this increase in security will last through the busy holiday period ... and we believe they 'll help a lot , " said mr bush .

they predict that it will move over greenland to southern scandinavia in the next few days .
low ozone events over europe are of great interest ankie piters , climate researcher levels of ozone in the atmosphere will fall to 60-70 % of the seasonal average as the hole deepens , according to scientists at the climate research centre , knmi , in the netherlands .
but they say the mini ozone hole does not present a significant threat to health .
" at this time of the year at our latitudes , the sun does not rise high enough above the horizon to deliver a significant amount of harmful ultra-violet light , " says ankie piters at knmi .
" but low ozone events over europe are still of great interest . "
the ozone loss was detected by an instrument aboard the european space agency probe ers-2 .
the device collects data in real time , allowing scientists to track the movement of the ozone hole from hour to hour .
ultra-violet shield the mini-hole over europe seems to be appearing because of unusual air currents in the atmosphere .
the ozone loss is not thought to be linked to the breakdown of ozone by chemicals .
measurements of the hole over antarctica taken in 1986 emissions of ozone-depleting gases have been blamed for the much larger hole over antarctica .
the chemicals include chlorofluorocarbons and halons , now limited under the montreal protocol , and bromine compounds , some of which are new and not covered by the international agreement .
in september , the antarctic ozone hole measured 26 million square kilometres -lrb- 10 million square miles -rrb- , almost as bad as the worst year recorded .
the ozone layer helps to shield the earth 's surface against harmful ultra-violet radiation from the sun .
