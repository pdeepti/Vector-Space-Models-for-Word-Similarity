the national institute for clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- has to decide which drugs and treatments are cost-effective enough to be prescribed .
however , it has run into criticism after rejecting the controversial multiple sclerosis drug beta interferon - and in the past has been accused of not listening sufficiently to patients before making decisions .
now nice is setting up the citizen 's council 's with up to 30 people representative of the varied population of england and wales .
this will be able to look at any ethical , social or moral issues arising from the work of the doctors and health economists in the rest of nice .
' public 's perspective ' andrew dillon , nice 's chief executive , said : " this is a really exciting development for the institute and the nhs .
we expect this council to provide nice with advice that reflects the public 's perspective on what are often challenging moral and ethical issues " .
andrew dillon : " an exciting development " " we want the council to be truly representative of the people who live in england and wales and will work hard to ensure that the people on it include the right mix of men and women , and that they are representative of the age , social class and ethnic structure of the people in england and wales .
" the council will not include people who work in the nhs or in private medicine .
similarly those working in the department of health , the national assembly for wales health teams , the healthcare industries or in groups or organisations supporting patient or industry groups , for example lobbying organisations , will also be excluded " a spokesman from the ms society , one of those which has complained about a perceived lack of patient involvement in nice , said that input " from the man and woman in the street " would be welcome .

the government wants to speed up the planning process after the lengthy deliberations over the heathrow terminal five scheme , which was opposed by environmental groups and people living nearby .
the project , which was given the go-ahead last tuesday , took nearly a decade to get off the ground .
the current system , according to ministers , amounts to a " banquet for barristers " and the legal profession .
during the £ 83m t5 inquiry , about 700 people gave evidence , 27,000 letters were received and 12 million sheets of paper were used before it handed its findings to the government .
speaking in the commons after tuesday 's decision , transport secretary stephen byers said the bureaucracy had to be stripped away to make the process " far more open and transparent " , and local people had to be given more of a say .
mr byers said proposed reforms would offer a " straightforward , common sense " approach which balanced the needs of communities with those of development .
local democracy threat lord falconer will shortly unveil details of a streamlined system , giving the government and parliament the power to decide in principle whether major projects should go ahead .
this would result in a shorter public inquiry to hear local objections and recommend how they might be overcome .
on saturday he will seek to allay the fears of local activists with a speech to suporters of the council for the protection of rural england .
the group believes the new rules will be an attack on people 's right to comment on projects that have serious implications for their local environment .
noise protest the meeting coincides with a march on downing street by anti-noise protesters demonstrating against t5 .
the protest has been organised by hacan clearskies , which represents residents who live under the west london flight path .
chairman john stewart said : " our members are very angry about the decision to give the go-ahead to terminal five .
we will not go away until the government gets serious about cutting the number of aircraft flying over the skies of london john stewart , hacan clearskies " it has condemned many of them to living out the rest of their days under a sky of sound .
" we will not go away until the government gets serious about cutting the number of aircraft flying over the skies of london .
" these aircraft are blighting our lives . "
the group won a key ruling at the european court of human rights last month , which could spell the end of night flights in the uk .
they claimed night flights were a violation of their human right to a good night 's sleep .

nur misuari , the former leader of the moro national liberation front , has been on the run since his forces started a fresh rebellion this week on the island of jolo in the southern philippines .
this is an internal matter of the philippines and malaysia should not interfere by providing refuge to rebels from other countries malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad more than 100 people have been killed in clashes between his guerrilla fighters and the government .
malaysia 's inspector-general of police norian mai said mr misuari and six of his followers were arrested at 3.30 am on saturday -lrb- 1930 gmt friday -rrb- on jampiras island off sabah state .
manila had ordered his arrest on charges of instigating a rebellion after the government suspended his governorship of an autonomous muslim region in mindanao , the armm .
although the philippines has no extradition treaty with malaysia , the authorities have already made clear that they intend to hand mr misuari over to the authorities in manila as soon as possible .
malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad had said before the arrest that , although his country had provided support to the rebel group in the past in its bid for autonomy , mr misuari had not used his powers correctly .
" therefore , we no long feel responsible to provide him with any assistance , " he said .
election looms extra troops had been sent into the region to hunt down mr misuari and to oversee an election on monday , when voters will elect his successor .
mr misuari had become governor of the region following a 1996 peace deal which he signed as the head of the mnlf with the philippine government , ending a 24 year guerrilla war and establishing muslim self-rule .
the rebel leader , who had been dropped as both leader of the mnlf and as candidate for the election by his party , claims the vote is a violation of the deal .
the authorities say he sparked the rebellion in an attempt to prevent the election going ahead .
but the bbc 's south east asia correspondent , jonathan head , says the philippine military is determined to crush the rebellion .
there are now some 6,000 troops on the island of jolo .
government warplanes have been attacking suspected rebel positions for five days , backed by artillery support .
police and soldiers are guarding all 9,253 precincts where voting will start on monday morning .
rebel threats president gloria arroyo has backed parouk hussin , mr misuari 's rival in the mnlf , as candidate to succeed him as governor .
she has bitterly attacked mr misuari 's leadership and his use of funds received from central government .
" he was a good warrior in the fight to win autonomy .
but good warriors do not automatically become good administrators , " she said recently on national television .
manila is keen to calm the uprising in jolo as it faces rebel threats from elsewhere .
the government is currently in peace talks with another rebel group , the moro islamic liberation front , and continues to fight a third much smaller group , the abu sayyaf , which has links with osama bin laden .

the decision was taken after protestant residents from glenbryn voted in favour of a package of community safety measures in the ardoyne area during a meeting on friday night .
speculation of a deal had mounted following talks between the residents and northern ireland 's first and deputy first ministers .
loyalist residents of glenbryn , where the holy cross school is situated , had been protesting outside the school since the beginning of september , prompting a large security operation .
they said they were protesting because of attacks on their community , which they claimed were by the larger catholic population of ardoyne .
on friday night , glenbryn residents discussed a package of safety measures on offer , such as road ramps , closed circuit television and police patrols .
the mp for north belfast , nigel dodds , and the progressive unionist party assembly member billy hutchinson , took part in the meeting .
chairman of the holy cross board of governors , father aiden troy , welcomed the suspension of the protest .
" it 's been a trying time for everybody , even people who were n't directly involved in the school , " he said .
" it 's affected everybody in ardoyne , not only here in holy cross but all the way up through glenbryn .
" hopefully , this is the beginning of a new and better life for us all . "
irish prime minister bertie ahern also relayed his congratulations .
mr ahern said he hoped it would now be possible to bring back normality to the people of the ardoyne - " especially the children " .
the development came after the first and deputy first ministers circulated a letter among the school governors , catholic parents and loyalist protesters .
balloons the letters covered a number of issues raised during a recent series of meetings about the daily protests .
earlier , catholic parents held a protest against the dispute outside the offices of belfast city council .
about 200 demonstrators , many carrying placards , and banners blocked roads outside the city hall .
