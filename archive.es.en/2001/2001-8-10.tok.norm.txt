a foundation representing prostitutes in the netherlands has filed a complaint against dutch financial giant ing , because the bank does not allow them to open business accounts .
rode draad -lrb- red thread -rrb- , as the foundation is known , maintains that ing and other dutch banks fail to treat prostitution - which is legal in the netherlands - as a proper profession .
it 's not a moral judgement .
our decision is pure business peter jong , ing in an attempt to open up access for prostitutes to financial services , rode draad has filed a complaint with the netherlands ' office of fair treatment , which deals with inequality issues .
" -lsb- ing -rsb- has refused to allow them business accounts and this is not equal treatment , " christie ten broeke , a member of rode draad 's board , told bbc news online .
" because most prostitutes are women , we have used this to make a complaint , " she added , explaining that the office of fair treatment only deals with issues such as race or gender .
' not a moral judgment ' ing defends itself by saying that it has a policy of not doing business with the sex industry .
" it 's not a moral judgement , " peter jong , a spokesman for the bank , said .
despite being legal , prostitutes find it hard to take out a mortgage " our decision is pure business .
it is too big a risk .
the sex industry is not stable or transparent and it is difficult to calculate risk . "
prostitution was legalised in the netherlands in 1815 under the french emperor napoleon , who was governing the territory at the time .
in 1988 it was defined as a legal profession and prostitutes were permitted to join a trade union .
however , 13 years on prostitutes still have problems getting home insurance , mortgages , or indeed any financial service that requires them to state their occupation .
and yet , as self-employed professionals , prostitutes are required by law to pay income tax and contributions to a dutch disability insurance fund .
tax-deductible condoms currently , prostitutes face little difficulty opening private bank accounts - although ing has only recently allowed this - because they are not required to reveal their line of work .
ing concedes it may have to change its policy if it loses however , opening a business account is preferable as it presents certain tax advantages .
prostitutes who can show that they earn business income can reclaim tax on expenses such as condoms and sex toys .
being treated as a commercial customer also makes it easier for prostitutes to take out loans to improve their businesses .
rode draad , which represents about 20,000 prostitutes , filed its complaint - based on individual complaints from prostitutes - earlier this year .
dirty money last week , representatives of the foundation , including ms ten broeke , attended a meeting at the office for fair treatment with ing to discuss the issue .
" we met with an -lsb- ing -rsb- lawyer and another man whose function was not made obvious to us , " ms ten broeke said , obviously irritated that the bank had chosen not to send any senior officials .
the tax people would be on them like ticks and fleas christie ten broeke rode draad during the hearing , ing defended its actions by saying that the sex industry was not transparent enough and that financial relationships with prostitutes could make it vulnerable to money laundering .
but ms ten broeke responded that any prostitute paying in large amounts of dirty money would immediately arouse suspicion .
" the tax people would be on them like ticks and fleas , " she said .
no sex please , we 're international ing is also concerned that dealings with prostitutes would not go down well with its other clients in countries that are " not as liberal as the netherlands " , said mr jong .
the netherlands ' other banking giant , abn amro , claims not to be so squeamish .
a prostitute is treated like a normal client , just a business woman .
geert pielage abn amro geert pielage , a spokesman for abn amro , told bbc news online , " we do n't exclude a group in advance . "
the key issue is whether their activity is legal or illegal , he added .
" a prostitute is treated like a normal client , just a business woman .
" if she wants a financial relationship with us , we look over her business , " he said , though he noted that the bank did not accept every application .
in ms ten broeke 's view , however , dutch banks are generally not so accommodating .
" many institutions do n't give -lsb- prostitutes -rsb- professional recognition , " she said .
decision due the office of fair treatment is due to make a decision on the case in a matter of weeks - by 24 september at the latest .
although the office can not force ing to open up business accounts to prostitutes , its ruling would be influential and could set a precedent .
ing 's mr jong concedes that the bank might have to revise its policy , if the ruling goes against it .
" it 's hard to say if we would change our policy .
" there are a lot of famous judges and lawyers working at the -lsb- office of fair treatment -rsb- .
" it 's not something we can do nothing about -lsb- if we lose the case -rsb- , we would want to discuss it very thoroughly . "
such sentiments will no doubt cheer the rode draad camp , which is keen to forge a milestone on the road to commercial recognition for prostitutes .
and besides , whether the foundation wins its case or not , the publicity has been great , admitted ms ten broeke .
" we have had a little publicity to show what a totally ridiculous concept this is , " she said .

i appreciate you giving me a few minutes of your time tonight so i can discuss with you a complex and difficult issue , an issue that is one of the most profound of our time .
" the issue of research involving stem cells derived from human embryos is increasingly the subject of a national debate and dinner table discussions .
we have arrived at that brave new world that seemed so distant in 1932 when alduous huxley wrote about human beings created in test tubes in what he called a hatchery " the issue is confronted every day in laboratories as scientists ponder the ethical ramifications of their work .
it is agonized over by parents and many couples as they try to have children or to save children already born .
" the issue is debated within the church , with people of different faiths , even many of the same faith , coming to different conclusions .
" many people are finding that the more they know about stem cell research , the less certain they are about the right ethical and moral conclusions .
" my administration must decide whether to allow federal funds , your tax dollars , to be used for scientific research on stem cells derived from human embryos .
" a large number of these embryos already exist .
they are the product of a process called in-vitro fertilisation , which helps so many couples conceive children .
" when doctors match sperm and egg to create life outside the womb , they usually produce more embryos than are implanted in the mother .
once a couple successfully has children or if they are unsuccessful , the additional embryos remain frozen in laboratories .
the united states has a long and proud record of leading the world toward advances in science and medicine that improve human life " some will not survive during long storage , others are destroyed .
a number have been donated to science and used to create privately funded stem-cell lines .
and a few have been implanted in an adoptive mother and born and are today healthy children .
" based on preliminary work that has been privately funded , scientists believe further research using stem cells offers great promise that could help improve the lives of those who suffer from many terrible diseases , from juvenile diabetes to alzheimer , from parkinson 's to spinal cord injuries .
" and while scientists admit they are not yet certain , they believe stem cells derived from embryos have unique potential .
" you should also know that stem cells can be derived from sources other than embryos : from adult cells , from umbilical cords that are discarded after babies are born , from human placentas .
" and many scientists feel research on these types of stem cells is also promising .
many patients suffering from a range of diseases are already being helped with treatments developed from adult stem cells .
as the discoveries of modern science create tremendous hope , they also lay vast ethical mine fields " however , most scientists , at least today , believe that research on embryonic stem cells offers the most promise because these cells have the potential to develop in all of the tissues in the body .
" scientists further believe that rapid progress in this research will come only with federal funds .
federal dollars help attract the best and brightest scientists .
" they ensure new discoveries are widely shared at the largest number of research facilities , and that the research is directed toward the greatest public good .
" the united states has a long and proud record of leading the world toward advances in science and medicine that improve human life , and the united states has a long and proud record of upholding the highest standards of ethics as we expand the limits of science and knowledge .
" research on embryonic stem cells raises profound ethical questions , because extracting the stem cell destroys the embryo , and thus destroys its potential for life .
embryonic stem cell research offers both great promise and great peril , so i have decided we must proceed with great care " like a snowflake , each of these embryos is unique , with the unique genetic potential of an individual human being .
" as i thought through this issue i kept returning to two fundamental questions .
first , are these frozen embryos human life and therefore something precious to be protected ?
and second , if they 're going to be destroyed anyway , should n't they be used for a greater good , for research that has the potential to save and improve other lives ?
" i 've asked those questions and others of scientists , scholars , bioethicists , religious leaders , doctors , researchers , members of congress , my cabinet and my friends .
" i have read heartfelt letters from many americans .
i have given this issue a great deal of thought , prayer , and considerable reflection , and i have found widespread disagreement .
" on the first issue , are these embryos human life ?
well , one researcher told me he believes this five-day-old cluster of cells is not an embryo , not yet an individual but a pre-embryo .
he argued that it has the potential for life , but it is not a life because it can not develop on its own .
" an ethicist dismissed that as a callous attempt at rationalisation .
' make no mistake , ' he told me , ' that cluster of cells is the same way you and i , and all the rest of us , started our lives .
one goes with a heavy heart if we use these , ' he said , ' because we are dealing with the seeds of the next generation . '
i have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines , where the life-and-death decision has already been made " and to the other crucial question - if these are going to be destroyed anyway , why not use them for good purpose ? - i also found different answers .
" many say these embryos are by-products of a process that helps create life and we should allow couples to donate them to science so they can be used for good purpose instead of wasting their potential .
" others will argue there is no such thing as excess life and the fact that a living being is going to die does not justify experimenting on it or exploiting it as a natural resource .
" at its core , this issue forces us to confront fundamental questions about the beginnings of life and the ends of science .
" it lives at a difficult moral intersection , juxtaposing the need to protect life in all its phases with the prospect of saving and improving life in all its stages .
" as the discoveries of modern science create tremendous hope , they also lay vast ethical mine fields .
i worry about a culture that devalues life , and believe as your president i have an important obligation to foster and encourage respect for life in america and throughout the world " as the genius of science extends the horizons of what we can do , we increasingly confront complex questions about what we should do .
" we have arrived at that brave new world that seemed so distant in 1932 when alduous huxley wrote about human beings created in test tubes in what he called a hatchery .
" in recent weeks , we learned that scientists have created human embryos in test tubes solely to experiment on them .
this is deeply troubling and a warning sign that should prompt all of us to think through these issues very carefully .
" embryonic stem cell research is at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards .
the initial stem cell researcher was at first reluctant to begin his research , fearing it might be used for human cloning .
" scientists have already cloned a sheep .
researchers are telling us the next step could be to clone human beings to create individual designer stem cells , essentially to grow another you , to be available in case you need another heart or lung or liver .
" i strongly oppose human cloning , as do most americans .
we recoil at the idea of growing human beings for spare body parts or creating life for our convenience .
" and while we must devote enormous energy to conquering disease , it is equally important that we pay attention to the moral concerns raised by the new frontier of human embryo stem cell research .
even the most noble ends do not justify any means .
great scientific progress can be made through aggressive federal funding of research on umbilical cord , placenta , adult and animal stem cells , which do not involve the same moral dilemma " my position on these issues is shaped by deeply held beliefs .
i 'm a strong supporter of science and technology , and believe they have the potential for incredible good - to improve lives , to save life , to conquer disease .
" research offers hope that millions of our loved ones may be cured of a disease and rid of their suffering .
" i have friends whose children suffer from juvenile diabetes .
" nancy reagan has written me about president reagan 's struggle with alzheimer 's .
my own family has confronted the tragedy of childhood leukaemia .

i have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines , where the life-and-death decision has already been made " and while we 're all hopeful about the potential of this research , no one can be certain that the science will live up to the hope it has generated .
" eight years ago , scientists believed foetal tissue research offered great hope for cures and treatments , yet the progress to date has not lived up to its initial expectations .
" embryonic stem cell research offers both great promise and great peril , so i have decided we must proceed with great care .
" as a result of private research , more than 60 genetically diverse stem cell lines already exist .
they were created from embryos that have already been destroyed , and they have the ability to regenerate themselves indefinitely , creating ongoing opportunities for research .
" i have concluded that we should allow federal funds to be used for research on these existing stem cell lines , where the life-and-death decision has already been made .
" leading scientists tell me research on these 60 lines has great promise that could lead to breakthrough therapies and cures .
" this allows us to explore the promise and potential of stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line by providing taxpayer funding that would sanction or encourage further destruction of human embryos that have at least the potential for life .
" i also believe that great scientific progress can be made through aggressive federal funding of research on umbilical cord , placenta , adult and animal stem cells , which do not involve the same moral dilemma .
as we go forward , i hope we will always be guided by both intellect and heart " this year your government will spent $ 250m on this important research .
" i will also name a president 's council to monitor stem cell research , to recommend appropriate guidelines and regulations and to consider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of biomedical innovation .
" this council will consist of leading scientists , doctors , ethicists , lawyers , theologians and others , and will be chaired by dr leon cass , a leading biomedical ethicist from the university of chicago .
" this council will keep us apprised of new developments and give our nation a forum to continue to discuss and evaluate these important issues .

superior court judge charles mccoy said that the original damages verdict against the firm was too high , setting an unfair precedent for future claims .
philip morris said it would appeal the " grossly excessive " verdict .
" our appeal will request a complete reversal and retrial on multiple grounds , not the least of which was the passion and prejudice the jury displayed in reaching its verdict , " the firm 's lawyer said in a statement .
the lawyer for richard boeken , the plaintiff , said a decision on whether or not to accept the reduced damages had not been made .
damage dispute in june , a jury in los angeles found philip morris liable for concealing the health dangers of cigarettes , awarding mr boeken $ 5.5m in compensatory damages and $ 3bn in punitive damages .
the award was the highest-ever sum granted to an individual plaintiff .
richard boeken has terminal cancer the firm not only quibbled with the level of damages , but argued that the verdict itself should be thrown out because there was no direct evidence that mr boeken followed the tobacco industry 's advice .
wall street hailed the ruling as a victory for philip morris and a first step in its bid to have the entire award thrown out on appeal .
" the concern was with $ 3bn , the flood gates were open , " said bonnie herzog , analyst at credit suisse first boston .
" this helps to alleviate some of that concern . "
claims pile up since the mid-1990s , there have been six similar cases where individuals have won compensation from a tobacco company .
but only one has resulted in someone actually receiving the money .
he was a 70-year-old ex-smoker who received $ 1.1m from the brown and williamson tobacco company .
philip morris is also involved in the biggest such case brought by smokers against tobacco companies .
last july , a jury in florida returned a historic punitive damage award of $ 145bn in a class action lawsuit on behalf of all florida 's smokers .
the case is pending a review by the us supreme court .

" europe is a different business , and were evaluating whether we should be there , " said gateway founder and chairman ted waitt .
gateway has notified its 1,000-plus european employees that it is mulling the closing of a plant in dublin , along with other operations in ireland and britain .
" but we have n't made any firm decisions on closing , " said mr waitt .
" we 're analyzing and coming up with several scenarios , which could include downsizing as well as closing . "
' dramatic move ' but few observers believe that the uk and irish operations will be saved .
since companies are obliged by uk and irish laws to consult for at least 30 days before making significant lay-offs , most fear that negotiations with staff are merely a formality .
the announcement " underlies how gateway is in the worst position in the pc market right now " , eric rothdeutsch , analyst at robertson stephens , said .
" this is clearly a dramatic move by gateway and a dramatic shift of strategy . "
closure would spell redundancy for 850 workers at a dublin plant whose opening in 1993 symbolised the transformation of ireland into a technology-backed economy .

but the firm has been particularly badly hit by slowdown in the global economy , finding that a store expansion programme in the us last year co-incided with a shrinking in the country 's overall pc market .
in europe , gateway 's sales have slumped by 46 % , the company 's ireland chief mike maloney said on thursday .
mr waitt , who spent a year in semi-retirement , has seized executive responsibilities in an effort to steer the firm back to profitability .

maoris are concerned about this and are looking at ways that they can stop it . "
as the law currently stands , there is no specific indigenous rights legislation .
the maori concept of ownership is such that the rights carry on in perpetuity .

new zealand 's finance minister michael cullen said the government is taking the issues seriously .
" we 've got the bill on trademarks legislation coming up in parliament in the very near future and that will be dealing specifically with the issue of protection of maori intellectual property through the trademark system . "
" so those issues are important and a way of generating the ability for greater economic returns out of maori culture and maori tradition , " he said .

the car firms said they would be able to boost output in the next few weeks in order to make up for lost production , but there will be delays in some export orders .
overall , the 14-day strike at tristar steering and suspension australia will cost the industry about a $ 400m -lrb- Â£ 144m ; $ 205m -rrb- .
" you 'll see it show up in slightly weaker manufacturing exports for august , but that will be made up over the rest of the quarter , " said tony meer , an economist at deutsche bank .
" but from a reputational point of view , it never does australia well to have these sort of events because we want tobe seen as a reliable source of product . "
back to work about 350 tristar workers have returned to work after a strike that caused three of australia 's four car makers - units of general motors , ford motor and mitsubishi - to run out of steering parts .
mitsubishi said that a shipment of 250 magna models to the middle east this month will be 100 short because of the strike .
the main point of contention was protection of tristar workers ' entitlements in the event of the company going out of business .
tristar has now agreed to protect pension and other entitlements in the event of failure .
the strike was an embarrassment to the australian government , which has claimed in recent years that the country 's shoddy record on labour relations had been dramatically improved .
the dispute also highlighted the vulnerability of manufacturers to a steady supply of parts as the industry has pared its inventory levels to the bare minimum .

stem cell research offers potential cures for diseases by julian siddle of bbc science stem cells are young cells which , in embryos , have the ability to develop into any of the body 's 130 different tissue types .
president bush 's decision has important implications for scientific research aimed at providing new drugs and alternatives to organ transplants .
scientist hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney , heart or even brain tissue scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney , heart or even brain tissue .
this tissue could then be used to repair damaged organs , and so provide an alternative to organ transplants .
it is possible to extract stem cells from fresh human embryos obtained from fertility treatments or abortions .
a more reliable supply , however , would be obtained by copying or cloning embryos specifically for their stem cells .
one embryo could , therefore , be a source for many thousands of cells .
heart breakthrough recently scientists in israel made the first heart tissue from stem cells .
they took one , modified it to act like a heart cell , and then allowed it to divide into other cells and form a tissue .
it 's not clear whether this process would be allowed in the us .
it 's likely that scientists involved in us-based stem cell research will take their expertise abroad , closely followed by their sponsors , the us biotechnology industry .
most countries do not have any laws on embryo research or cloning , but the most likely destination is britain , where limited cloning is allowed .
