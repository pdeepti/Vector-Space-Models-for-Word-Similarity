he said they had not received a warning before the explosion .
xian is home to a sizeable ethnic uighur muslim population and uighur separatists have staged several bombings in western china in the past .

twenty of the explosions were in zhanjiang city , where the suspect lin guojian lived , the official xinhua news agency quoted police as saying .
lin blew himself up , police said .
the other three explosions were in nearby jiangmen city where lin was born .
reports said lin had taught himself how to make bombs and he used a mobile phone and electronic devices to detonate some of them .
hong kong media also reported explosions in the nearby cities of maoming and yangjiang , but police and city officials in maoming said they had no reports of this .
bombings are on the rise in china , where explosives are cheap and easy to buy .
