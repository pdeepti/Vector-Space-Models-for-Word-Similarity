anti-taleban afghan fighters are reported to be closing in on the city as efforts to negotiate the surrender of militia commanders continue .
the situation right now is quite quiet and calm .
bombing is going on right now , but there is no fighting khalid pashtoon many residents of kandahar , including taleban officials , have already fled .
khalid pashtoon , a spokesman for former kandahar mujahideen governor gul agha , told the reuters news agency that agha 's army of 3,000 fighters was massed six kilometres -lrb- four miles -rrb- south of the airport but had no immediate plans to advance .
" the situation right now is quite quiet and calm .
bombing is going on right now , but there is no fighting , " pashtoon told reuters by satellite telephone .
a top commander of the anti-taleban northern alliance , speaking in kabul , earlier claimed that alliance forces had entered kandahar .
but there has been no independent confirmation of this , and correspondents point out that the northern alliance , mainly made up of ethnic minority uzbeks and tajiks , would be unwelcome in the primarily-pashtun south .
speaking in washington , rear admiral john stufflebeem , the deputy director of operations for the us joint chiefs of staff , said he could not confirm the report .
taleban defiance taleban leader mullah mohammed omar has told his fighters that there is no question of surrender , and no need for negotiations .
as well as kandahar , the key border town of spin boldak remains in taleban hands .
" do n't vacate any areas , " mullah omar said .
" this is not a question of tribes - this is a question of islam . "
there have been reports of secret talks between the taleban and tribes in the area , but these have been publicly denied .
the former governor of kandahar , gul agha , is in control of a village between the city and the border , backed by anti-taleban forces , and clashes have been reported .
pressure on al-qaeda us officials say anti-taleban forces have captured a follower of osama bin laden who is also related to sheikh omar abdel-rahman , the egyptian cleric jailed in the us for plotting to blow up new york city landmarks .
the sheikh 's son ahmed was reportedly being held in mazar-e-sharif where he was being interrogated by american agents .
the us believes he is a recruiter for bin laden 's al-qaeda network .
us sources also said there were " credible " but as-yet uncorroborated intelligence reports that a taleban intelligence chief had defected to the northern alliance at thursday 's pentagon briefing in washington , spokeswoman victoria clarke refused to comment but said defections among senior taleban officials were " another sign that the taleban continues to be degraded " .
troop moves us marines are continuing to arrive at the dolangi airfield base about 130 kilometres -lrb- 80 miles -rrb- south of kandahar , increasing the force to about 800 , said pentagon spokeswoman victoria clarke .
their role is reported to be the closure of potential escape routes to pakistan and iran for taleban and al-qaeda fighters , and the pentagon said that their number was likely to increase .
the bbc 's steve kingston says they will also prove crucial in searching the region 's myriad of caves and tunnels for osama bin laden , in what may prove a far more dangerous aspect of the campaign .
us defence secretary donald rumsfeld described the work as part of " dangerous " yet necessary tactics .
" our efforts , of course , will be shifting from cities at some point to hunting down and rooting out terrorists where they hide ... this is difficult work , it 's dangerous work , " he said during a visit to us central command in florida .

leader iain duncan smith has charged the former cabinet minister with the task of increasing the number of women tory mps .
having scorned labour 's use of all-women shortlists ahead of the 1997 election , denouncing them as politically correct nonsense , the tories are now in the uncomfortable position of only 14 of its 166 mps being women - compared to labour 's 95 out of a total 413 .

indeed , all the electoral evidence appears to show that the fact the party in parliament does not come close to reflecting the public whose support it needs , is a significant factor in its deep unpopularity .
duncan smith opposed a signs of how seriously some senior tories judge the problem can be seen in the increasing number of discordant voices backing once unthinkable direct measures to boost the number of women mps .
in the summer shadow cabinet member theresa may was among tories calling for quotas for women and ethnic minority candidates in order to guarantee their selection .
she also called for a rethink of the party 's opposition to all-women shortlists .
but mr duncan smith and his chosen party chairman david davis are adamantly opposed and have ruled out both proposals .
token gestures ?
party chiefs have instead made limited moves they hope will go some way towards heading off internal criticism from activists seeking concrete moves to boost the number of women mps , and who fear only token gestures are being made .
tony blair and his many mp " babes " are a cause of tory envy as well as mrs shephard 's new job , the tory leader has appointed two new female party vice-chairs , one devoted to candidates .
theresa may and fellow shadow cabinet member caroline spelman are being heavily promoted as public faces of the party .
conservative central office is setting up an abundance of training schemes to help tory women seeking to become mps .
and it will be stressed to local conservative associations across the country that come the next round of selections , they should choose the candidate most likely to win rather than the one who most appeals to them .
the two are far from necessarily the same thing .
it is doubtful whether this is enough to calm the discontent of campaigners in the party agitating for more far-reaching action , and tired of slogging endlessly around the selection circuit .
' train the selection committees ' deputy leader michael ancram , in his closing speech to the conference , rehearsed what has become the standard praise for women tory members as " the bedrock of our organisation " .
but earlier , the party chairman faced a rough ride from the same audience .
caroline spelman : adding female appeal to a heavily male front bench according to representatives attending a members-only question-and-answer session , the offer of yet more training schemes and further appeals to local parties was far from the satisfying answer mr davis might have hoped .
the same theme was echoed later when angela watkinson , the sole new tory mp at the june general election , talked of the " multitude " of training events , how-to-become-an-mp weekends and the like .
" my own view is that we need to have proper training for selection committees , " she told the conference .
this is where the real problem lies , according to the party 's modernisers .
for it is the at the grassroots stage that many women candidates are blocked - by other women .
most tory members are women women form a majority of the tory party 's 300,000-plus membership ; they also tend to dominate local associations ' selection committees .
they also tend to be a lot older than the younger , professional and ambitious women that appear before them .
according to patrick seyd , professor of politics at sheffield university and the foremost academic authority on the tory membership , the typical female member is in her sixties and more right wing than their male counterparts .
the clash between the two types of women members was evident when pat harvey , a businesswoman and former chair of the conservative national women 's council , addressed the conference .
an opponent of all-women shortlists , her speech ripped into the overhaul of the party 's organisational structure carried out under william hague 's leadership in order to professionalise it .
" how wrong they were , " she declared .
" ninety per cent of our problems lay with our elected representatives , many of whose lifestyles did little to enhance our image . "
women conservatives " modernisers " fear that it is this side of the party 's female wing that will end up thwarting their attempts to broaden the tories ' appeal beyond its narrow core support .

in a further sign of the resilience of the uk economy , optimism among britons rose by an index level of two points this month , the report found .
fall and rise in confidence august : 0 september : -1 october : -5 november : -3 data : hamblin gfk but the rise was insufficient to return the index to positive territory , meaning that most britons are still gloomy about economic conditions .
the survey comes the day after a survey by the bank of england revealed that lending grew by £ 5bn in october , with mortgages accounting for most of the figure .
mixed feelings a majority believe that the current time is a good one to make major purchases , friday 's report said .
most britons were also optimistic that their financial position would improve over the next year .

president castro 's government requested the sale to help cope with the devastation caused by hurricane michelle four weeks ago .
officials in washington stressed that the trade embargo against the island 's communist government remained firmly in place .
the deal was made possible by legislation enacted by the us congress last year which allows the sale of some food and medicine to cuba .
the us agriculture department confirmed that havana had bought 50,000 tonnes of us wheat , more than 40,000 tonnes of corn , and 12,500 tonnes of rice .

the government in havana has consistently called for the embargo to be lifted , saying it stops medicines reaching cuban hospitals and books reaching cuban schools .
the united nations voted earlier this week for the 10 year running for the embargo to be lifted , but washington has said it will remain in place until president castro leaves power and democracy returns to cuba .

bbc news -pipe- music -pipe- george harrison : the quiet beatle categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : entertainment : music front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment showbiz music film arts tv and radio new media reviews talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 30 november , 2001 , 08:37 gmt george harrison : the quiet beatle george harrison loved rock 'n'roll as a teenager he was the diffident beatle , a quiet and unassuming figure beside the towering egos of john lennon and paul mccartney .
but , after his innate creativity was allowed to flourish , george harrison made his own mark as a great songwriter , with works such as here comes the sun , while my guitar gently weeps holding their own beside those of his colleagues .
and something was hailed by frank sinatra as " the greatest love song ever written " .
the son of a bus driver , george harrison was born in the hunts cross area of liverpool on 25 february 1943 .
as a teenager with john and paul although his childhood home was a back-to-back-terrace house with an outside toilet , a scholarship to the liverpool institute , where he met paul mccartney , a year his senior , held out the promise of a better life .
like millions of his contemporaries , the young george harrison fell under the spell of rock ' n ' roll , especially the records brought to liverpool by visiting seamen and played , by night , on radio luxembourg .
aged 14 , he bought a £ 3 guitar , music replaced his academic studies and , a year later , his mastery of more than the mere basic chords brought about his induction into the quarrymen , a group which featured john lennon and paul mccartney .
after learning their trade and honing their musical abilities in british clubs and on hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn the group , now known as the beatles , settled their line-up in 1962 with the addition of a drummer , ringo starr .
singing she loves you after finding a manager , brian epstein , and signing for the little-known parlophone label , the beatles quickly established themselves as a major act .
george harrison 's stage presence , thoughtful and concentrated alongside the grimacing and pouting of lennon and mccartney , was a crucial factor in the group 's success .
when the beatles ' broke ' the united states in 1964 , his superstar status was assured .
george harrison 's lead guitar style , based on that of his hero , carl perkins , defined the sound of the mid-sixties .
george harrison 's burgeoning love affair with oriental mysticism first made itself known on norwegian wood , john lennon 's tale of an extra-marital fling .
inspirational acoustic guitar and muted bass were augmented by a new instrument , the sitar .
the paradigm had shifted , this was serious rock music for serious people .
1966 's revolver saw three harrison compositions , including taxman , a bitter and cutting protest at the 95 % surtax which he and his colleagues now had to pay and the following year 's sergeant pepper brought within and without you , a reflective indian love song .
but it was during the group 's long death-throes , between 1968 and 1970 , that george harrison finally found his voice with three inspirational tracks .
harrison and the beatles transformed popular music while my guitar gently weeps , a bitter-sweet reflection on love and morality , augmented by the guitar of eric clapton , the deceptively simple here comes the sun , one of the first songs to feature a synthesiser , and something , a paeon of praise to his then wife pattie boyd , transformed his reputation .
indeed , when released as a single , the much-covered something sold more than a million copies .
aged just 26 when the beatles finally split , george harrison threw himself into meditation and gardening , transforming the vast grounds of his house , friar 's park in henley on thames .
his critically-acclaimed triple album , all things must pass , featured the hit single my sweet lord , for which he was later successfully sued for ' subconscious plagiarism ' and , in 1971 , 13 years before liveaid , he organised the star-studded concert for bangladesh , to help the famine-ridden country .
he was just 26 when the beatles split during the 1970s , george harrison 's musical output varied in quality from the well-received thirty-three to a third to dark horse , his artistic nadir produced following his divorce from pattie -lrb- he would marry his second wife , olivia arias , in 1978 -rrb- .
in 1980 all those years ago , his homage to the recently-murdered john lennon went to number two in the uk charts .
alongside this , though , his career as a film producer went from strength to strength .
he backed monty python 's life of brian and , through handmade films , was responsible for the long good friday , time bandits and mona lisa .
the 1980s saw a revitalised harrison team up with former elo front-man jeff lynne , first on his own album cloud nine and then , with the addition of bob dylan , tom petty and roy orbison , as the traveling wilburys .

but , after his innate creativity was allowed to flourish , george harrison made his own mark as a great songwriter , with works such as here comes the sun , while my guitar gently weeps holding their own beside those of his colleagues .
and something was hailed by frank sinatra as " the greatest love song ever written " .
the son of a bus driver , george harrison was born in the hunts cross area of liverpool on 25 february 1943 .
although his childhood home was a back-to-back-terrace house with an outside toilet , a scholarship to the liverpool institute , where he met paul mccartney , a year his senior , held out the promise of a better life .
like millions of his contemporaries , the young george harrison fell under the spell of rock ' n ' roll , especially the records brought to liverpool by visiting seamen and played , by night , on radio luxembourg .
aged 14 , he bought a £ 3 guitar , music replaced his academic studies and , a year later , his mastery of more than the mere basic chords brought about his induction into the quarrymen , a group which featured john lennon and paul mccartney .
after learning their trade and honing their musical abilities in british clubs and on hamburg 's notorious reeperbahn the group , now known as the beatles , settled their line-up in 1962 with the addition of a drummer , ringo starr .
after finding a manager , brian epstein , and signing for the little-known parlophone label , the beatles quickly established themselves as a major act .
george harrison 's stage presence , thoughtful and concentrated alongside the grimacing and pouting of lennon and mccartney , was a crucial factor in the group 's success .
when the beatles ' broke ' the united states in 1964 , his superstar status was assured .
george harrison 's lead guitar style , based on that of his hero , carl perkins , defined the sound of the mid-sixties .
george harrison 's burgeoning love affair with oriental mysticism first made itself known on norwegian wood , john lennon 's tale of an extra-marital fling .
inspirational acoustic guitar and muted bass were augmented by a new instrument , the sitar .
the paradigm had shifted , this was serious rock music for serious people .
1966 's revolver saw three harrison compositions , including taxman , a bitter and cutting protest at the 95 % surtax which he and his colleagues now had to pay and the following year 's sergeant pepper brought within and without you , a reflective indian love song .
but it was during the group 's long death-throes , between 1968 and 1970 , that george harrison finally found his voice with three inspirational tracks .
while my guitar gently weeps , a bitter-sweet reflection on love and morality , augmented by the guitar of eric clapton , the deceptively simple here comes the sun , one of the first songs to feature a synthesiser , and something , a paeon of praise to his then wife pattie boyd , transformed his reputation .
indeed , when released as a single , the much-covered something sold more than a million copies .
aged just 26 when the beatles finally split , george harrison threw himself into meditation and gardening , transforming the vast grounds of his house , friar 's park in henley on thames .
his critically-acclaimed triple album , all things must pass , featured the hit single my sweet lord , for which he was later successfully sued for ' subconscious plagiarism ' and , in 1971 , 13 years before liveaid , he organised the star-studded concert for bangladesh , to help the famine-ridden country .
during the 1970s , george harrison 's musical output varied in quality from the well-received thirty-three to a third to dark horse , his artistic nadir produced following his divorce from pattie -lrb- he would marry his second wife , olivia arias , in 1978 -rrb- .
in 1980 all those years ago , his homage to the recently-murdered john lennon went to number two in the uk charts .
alongside this , though , his career as a film producer went from strength to strength .
he backed monty python 's life of brian and , through handmade films , was responsible for the long good friday , time bandits and mona lisa .
the 1980s saw a revitalised harrison team up with former elo front-man jeff lynne , first on his own album cloud nine and then , with the addition of bob dylan , tom petty and roy orbison , as the traveling wilburys .
orbison 's death put paid to the project after two albums .
impact although he appeared onstage at a benefit concert for the natural law party during the 1992 british general election , george harrison 's lifestyle became more and more reclusive , the success of the beatles ' anthology , for which he teamed up again with paul and ringo for , having made him financially secure .
in december 1999 he was nearly killed when stabbed by an intruder in his henley mansion and repeated treatment for cancer kept him in the headlines .

following his youthful success , he spent the second half of his life in a love / hate relationship with the memories of the days when he and john , paul and ringo changed the sound of pop music forever .

their catholic musical tastes meant that all kinds of genres could be incorporated into contemporary pop - including music hall , ballads , folk and classical pastiches .
and the group is generally seen as the originator of the concept album , with 1967 's sgt pepper 's lonely hearts club band .
their influence on artists as diverse as elton john and pink floyd was obvious as the 1970s began .
while the beatles ' star waned with the advent of punk and new wave music in the late 1970s , even then the influence of the beatles ' sound and style could still be heard in artists like squeeze , the police and elvis costello .

his chance came after original drummer pete best was sacked - and the band 's popularity began to rocket soon after ringo joined .
a solid and , some say , underrated drummer , ringo also sang on a number of tracks including the million-selling yellow submarine .
he has been considered the least musically gifted of the beatles ' four members - but his solo career began before the group had even officially split up .
released in early 1970 , his first album was full of 30s and 40s cover versions which included cole porter 's night and day and were arranged by maurice gibb , george martin , quincy jones and paul mccartney .
the album , sentimental journey , reached the top 10 in britain - but starr reportedly only made it to please his parents .
for his second release , he chose another style .
rock and roll return beaucoups of blues , also released in 1970 , was recorded in nashville , tackled the country genre and also consisted of cover versions .
his next long-player was closer to what beatles fans were used to .
simply called ringo , it enlisted his former bandmates as songwriting partners and musicians , and included the uk top 10 singles it do n't come easy , photograph and you 're sixteen .
another four albums followed before the end of the decade , but none matched ringo 's success .
and after impressing with his deadpan wit in beatles films a hard day 's night and help ! , starr also carved a sideline in acting .
the pope he took roles in 1968 's candy , which also starred marlon brando and richard burton , and peter sellers ' the magic christian the following year .
other roles included starring alongside david essex in acclaimed drama that 'll be the day and as the pope in ken russell 's 1975 " erotic , exotic electrifying rock fantasy " lisztomania .
starr 's scouse tones became known to a new generation when he became narrator for children 's animated tv series thomas the tank engine in 1984 .
apart from that , the 1980s were not happy times for starr .
the 1983 album old wave did not see the light of day , and nor did an abandoned album , recorded with producer chips moman in 1987 .
but starr resurrected his musical career at the end of the 1980s , putting together his all-starr band for a successful tour .
further tours followed in 1992 , 1995 and 1997 , and starr collaborated with the other remaining beatles for 1995 's anthology album .
with an all-starr band live album recently released to mark his 60th birthday , starr has not hung up his drumsticks yet .

while the other members of the beatles , john lennon , paul mccartney and ringo starr , were happy to thrust themselves into the spotlight , george was the one to be found shunning his fame .
he was forced to exist in the wonderful musical shadows that were john lennon and paul mccartney , a position that urged george to once describe himself as the " economy class beatle " .
later , when discussing his former group , he was forced to admit : " i felt like an observer of the beatles , even though i was with them .
i think john and paul were the stars of the beatles . "
but , aside from a couple of brief disagreements , george always seemed to remain close to john after the split of the group , but with paul , it was much more arduous .
when paul would announce that some kind of beatles reconciliation was on the cards , george would retaliate , announcing , like he did in 1974 , that he " never wants to play in a band with paul mccartney again " .
but with ringo , george always remained close , often being seen out in public , socialising and even appearing in occasional concerts together , like the carl perkins television special and the princes trust shows in 1985 and 1987 respectively .
and while john , paul and george had their expected difficulties in dealing with each other after the beatles acrimonious split , ringo became the friendly bridge between the group 's dissected members .
and for fans , the thought that two members of the beatles are no longer with us , is one that is most hard to swallow .
when we watched their first film a hard day 's night , or any others of their big-screen movies , we honestly believed that the beatles , and its members , were bigger than human and would last for eternity , remaining ageless .
very slowly , and reluctantly , we became accustomed to the tragic passing of john lennon in 1980 .
but 21 years later , the passing of george harrison , succumbing to cancer makes us realise that even the great beatles are susceptible to the things that affect mere mortals .
for the first time , it seemed that george had , at last , become the important beatle and it must have given him immense pleasure to realise that we did , after all , really did love the quiet , spiritual and kind member of the fab four .
the beatles legacy is still unchallenged .
we 'll still talk , listen and dissect the group 's legacy for many years to come .
a new generation of beatles worshippers will spring up next year when love me do celebrates its 40th anniversary .
but it 's most sad to report that now , 39 years after their debut release , just paul and ringo are still with us , to charm and entertain us .
it just does n't seem right .
we really did believe they 'd outlive us all .
thankfully , i 'm sure that paul will still be with us when he 's 64 , still releasing albums and promoting vegetarianism .
and i 'm also sure that ringo will continue to perform songs and deliver new albums for many years to come .
massive blow george once described dying as just the removal of one overcoat , while the sprit lives on .
due to his strong krishna belief , george took john lennon 's death philosophically .
but his death will still come as a massive blow to his former beatles colleagues and his many legions of fans around the world .
paul recently broke off from wingspan promotions to visit george in italy and ringo said that he had been in regular contact with george .
for them , there is nothing that can be written to explain how they must be feeling .
more than losing a beatles colleague , they have lost a dear friend , someone that they endured so much with in the crazy 60s and beyond .
shrine in this sad time , they 'll take solace when they recall the beatles song george wrote which contained the line : " life flows on within in and without you . "
and for the fans , there is no doubt that scenes of mass hysteria will be witnessed .
george 's mansion in henley , like john 's dakota apartment block in new york , will become a shrine to thousands of fans from around the world .
for many of these fans , the beatles are their life and the thought that this world will be one more beatle less , will be extremely hard to digest .

a solid and , some say , underrated drummer , ringo also sang on a number of tracks including the million-selling yellow submarine .
he released his first solo album before the beatles split he has been considered the least musically gifted of the beatles ' four members - but his solo career began before the group had even officially split up .
released in early 1970 , his first album was full of 30s and 40s cover versions which included cole porter 's night and day and were arranged by maurice gibb , george martin , quincy jones and paul mccartney .
the album , sentimental journey , reached the top 10 in britain - but starr reportedly only made it to please his parents .
for his second release , he chose another style .
rock and roll return beaucoups of blues , also released in 1970 , was recorded in nashville , tackled the country genre and also consisted of cover versions .
his next long-player was closer to what beatles fans were used to .
simply called ringo , it enlisted his former bandmates as songwriting partners and musicians , and included the uk top 10 singles it do n't come easy , photograph and you 're sixteen .
another four albums followed before the end of the decade , but none matched ringo 's success .
and after impressing with his deadpan wit in beatles films a hard day 's night and help ! , starr also carved a sideline in acting .
the pope he took roles in 1968 's candy , which also starred marlon brando and richard burton , and peter sellers ' the magic christian the following year .
other roles included starring alongside david essex in acclaimed drama that 'll be the day and as the pope in ken russell 's 1975 " erotic , exotic electrifying rock fantasy " lisztomania .
ringo married barbara bach in 1981 starr 's scouse tones became known to a new generation when he became narrator for children 's animated tv series thomas the tank engine in 1984 .
apart from that , the 1980s were not happy times for starr .
the 1983 album old wave did not see the light of day , and nor did an abandoned album , recorded with producer chips moman in 1987 .
but starr resurrected his musical career at the end of the 1980s , putting together his all-starr band for a successful tour .
further tours followed in 1992 , 1995 and 1997 , and starr collaborated with the other remaining beatles for 1995 's anthology album .
with an all-starr band live album recently released to mark his 60th birthday , starr has not hung up his drumsticks yet .

while the other members of the beatles , john lennon , paul mccartney and ringo starr , were happy to thrust themselves into the spotlight , george was the one to be found shunning his fame .
he was forced to exist in the wonderful musical shadows that were john lennon and paul mccartney , a position that urged george to once describe himself as the " economy class beatle " .
later , when discussing his former group , he was forced to admit : " i felt like an observer of the beatles , even though i was with them .
i think john and paul were the stars of the beatles . "
harrison : " economy class beatle " but , aside from a couple of brief disagreements , george always seemed to remain close to john after the split of the group , but with paul , it was much more arduous .
when paul would announce that some kind of beatles reconciliation was on the cards , george would retaliate , announcing , like he did in 1974 , that he " never wants to play in a band with paul mccartney again " .
but with ringo , george always remained close , often being seen out in public , socialising and even appearing in occasional concerts together , like the carl perkins television special and the princes trust shows in 1985 and 1987 respectively .
and while john , paul and george had their expected difficulties in dealing with each other after the beatles acrimonious split , ringo became the friendly bridge between the group 's dissected members .
george and paul " clashed in the studio " and for fans , the thought that two members of the beatles are no longer with us , is one that is most hard to swallow .
when we watched their first film a hard day 's night , or any others of their big-screen movies , we honestly believed that the beatles , and its members , were bigger than human and would last for eternity , remaining ageless .
very slowly , and reluctantly , we became accustomed to the tragic passing of john lennon in 1980 .
but 21 years later , the passing of george harrison , succumbing to cancer makes us realise that even the great beatles are susceptible to the things that affect mere mortals .
for the first time , it seemed that george had , at last , become the important beatle and it must have given him immense pleasure to realise that we did , after all , really did love the quiet , spiritual and kind member of the fab four .
" an underrated musical genius " the beatles legacy is still unchallenged .
we 'll still talk , listen and dissect the group 's legacy for many years to come .
a new generation of beatles worshippers will spring up next year when love me do celebrates its 40th anniversary .
but it 's most sad to report that now , 39 years after their debut release , just paul and ringo are still with us , to charm and entertain us .
it just does n't seem right .
we really did believe they 'd outlive us all .
thankfully , i 'm sure that paul will still be with us when he 's 64 , still releasing albums and promoting vegetarianism .
and i 'm also sure that ringo will continue to perform songs and deliver new albums for many years to come .
massive blow george once described dying as just the removal of one overcoat , while the sprit lives on .
due to his strong krishna belief , george took john lennon 's death philosophically .
but his death will still come as a massive blow to his former beatles colleagues and his many legions of fans around the world .
paul recently broke off from wingspan promotions to visit george in italy and ringo said that he had been in regular contact with george .
for them , there is nothing that can be written to explain how they must be feeling .
more than losing a beatles colleague , they have lost a dear friend , someone that they endured so much with in the crazy 60s and beyond .
shrine in this sad time , they 'll take solace when they recall the beatles song george wrote which contained the line : " life flows on within in and without you . "
and for the fans , there is no doubt that scenes of mass hysteria will be witnessed .
george 's mansion in henley , like john 's dakota apartment block in new york , will become a shrine to thousands of fans from around the world .
for many of these fans , the beatles are their life and the thought that this world will be one more beatle less , will be extremely hard to digest .

the man who , with john lennon , wrote some of the most popular songs in history has had the most successful solo musical career of the beatles and is now treated as rock royalty .
born in 1942 in liverpool , mccartney was only 15 years old when he auditioned for john lennon 's skiffle band the quarrymen at a local church fête .

the transfer of the red light area from coburg street to salamander street in the leith area of the city provoked outrage among residents and local businesses .
that led lothian and borders police to announce in august that the zone would be scrapped from midnight on 30 november .
the police have worked hard to build up a relationship and trust with us and have treated us with respect ruth morgan-thomas a steering group is still trying to find an alternative site in a non-residential area .
the aim of the tolerance zone was to provide an area in which the capital 's sex workers could operate safely .
police had unofficially tolerated the activities of prostitutes who gathered in leith since the early 1980s to make it easier for health agencies to regulate the spread of hiv .
the prostitutes were given strict guidelines , such as when they could congregate and how many people would be permitted in the area .
however , the red light area was moved from its former home at coburg street after complaints from residents following the gentrification of the area in the late 1990s .
the salamander street experiment also provoked opposition from local residents and businesses .
it now remains to be seen where the prostitutes will seek to ply their trade .
a city of edinburgh council steering committee is currently looking for a new location .
duddingston councillor ian berry has said he was approached by police with a view to setting up a tolerance zone in his ward , but this has been ruled out following an outcry by residents .
support group scotpep fears that the clock will be turned back 20 years to a time when the sex industry created huge health problems and led to crimes like serious assault and even murder .
in private , police sources agree with that view .
but the lothian and borders force stressed that , from saturday onwards , any complaints against prostitutes from people in leith would be investigated and dealt with .
steering committee edinburgh city council says it is sympathetic to continuing a tolerance zone in the capital , but there are legal limitations to the support it can give .
scotpep project manager ruth morgan-thomas said she hoped a new zone could be found soon .
the advisor to the steering committee said she was " disappointed " that the salamander street zone was to be closed - but praised police for their work in the area .
" it 's not their fault .
their hands have been tied by residents who were threatening a judicial review to get us out because prostitution is , after all , illegal , " she said .
" the police have worked hard to build up a relationship and trust with us and have treated us with respect and have kept the pimps and pushers and women-beaters away . "

for the first time in south africa 's medical history , the plant , sutherlandia frutescens , sub-species microphylla , is to undergo clinical trials to assess its immune-boosting properties .
we are certainly not making the absurd claim that sutherlandia is a cure-all or a cure for aids dr nigel gericke phyto nova the medical research council will conduct the trials early next year and results are expected within three to six months .
anecdotal evidence is already mounting , suggesting that this plant can improve the quality of life of thousands of people both with hiv and full-blown aids .
sutherlandia frutescens grows wild in the western cape and in the hills of zululand .
cancer bush a particular variety of the plant has been used for centuries as a potent medicine by south africa 's indigenous san people who call it " insisa " - the one that dispels darkness .
they used it as an energy booster and a powerful anti-depressant .
traditional healers have been using it for decades zulu sangomas or traditional healers know it as " unwele " , the great medicine that was used to ward off the effects of the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic which claimed 20 million lives worldwide .
the tswana people know it as " mukakana " for its power in treating gonorrhoea and syphilis , while the afrikaners call it the " kankerbossie " or cancer bush , because of its properties in treating people suffering with internal cancers and wasting .
molecular combination a local company specialising in the development of indigenous plant medicines , phyto nova , first started researching the bio-chemical properties of sutherlandia about three years ago .
phyto nova planted acres of the plant a multi-disciplinary team headed by dr nigel gericke , a botanist , medical doctor and indigenous plant specialist , found that sutherlandia contained a powerful combination of molecules which have been identified and used in the treatment of patients with cancer tuberculosis , diabetes , schizophrenia and clinical depression and as an antiretroviral agent .
phyto nova were so convinced that sutherlandia could be used as a tonic for people infected with hiv and aids , that they contracted farmers to plant acres of the bush , to prevent wild supplies being over-harvested .
they have been manufacturing high quality sutherlandia tablets , gel and powder .
having determined that the product was safe when administered with a balanced food diet , the company distributed sutherlandia to aids patients .
quality of life " anecdotally we are accumulating evidence that wasted patients with aids , tb and cancer pick up weight , regain energy and appetite , " says dr gericke .
" the claim we are making on the basis of this , is that we can significantly and dramatically improve the quality of life of many ill aids patients ...
we are certainly not making the absurd claim that sutherlandia is a cure-all or a cure for aids . "
sutherlandia does not work properly just on a diet of porridge - you have to have vegetables virginia rathele nurse and sangoma whatever comes of the clinical trial , word of the plant 's properties is already spreading among south africa 's traditional healers .
at the same time as phyto nova was conducting its research , one of the country 's most venerated traditional healers , dr credo mutwa , 80 , was using sutherlandia to treat aids patients .
" my aunt minah , who is 103 years old , told me that we should use the great medicine against aids , " said dr mutwa .
" i said to her : ' but aunt , the white people tell us there is no cure for this disease ' .
" and my aunt said : ' for every disease there is a treatment .
try this medicine ' .
and i tried it . "
' near-miraculous ' " i have treated people who were told by the doctors at the hospital to ' go home and die ' and they are still alive today , three years after they should have died .
this plant is near-miraculous , i can say that with certainty , " he says .
tablets , powder and gel are already on sale testimony to the efficacy of the plant continues to mount .
anne hutchings , an ethno-botanist and lecturer at the university of zululand has been using sutherlandia , together with a range of other indigenous plant medicines , to treat aids patients who attend the weekly aids clinic at ngwelezane hospital .
she has 176 patients who all testify that sutherlandia has helped them to live a fuller , healthier and more productive life .
no response in the northern cape town of kuruman , nurse and sangoma , virginia rathele is using sutherlandia at her clinic to treat more than 300 aids patients .
she says an integral part of the treatment is to tell patients to eat healthily .
" sutherlandia does not work properly just on a diet of porridge .
you have to have vegetables , " she said .
rathele says that sutherlandia only works with a balanced diet one client , who weighed 26kg and was close to death in april this year , now weighs 45kg and is helping ms rathele run the clinic .
patents can not be taken out on plants which have well-documented folk use , which means that sutherlandia should remain accessible to anyone .
at present , one month 's supply of phyto nova tablets costs a little under $ 2.50 and two months ' supply of the powder form of the medication can be bought for under 50 cents .
phyto nova has approached the south african government in a bid to persuade them to grow the plant on a massive scale for use in public health treatment .

cancer bush a particular variety of the plant has been used for centuries as a potent medicine by south africa 's indigenous san people who call it " insisa " - the one that dispels darkness .
they used it as an energy booster and a powerful anti-depressant .
zulu sangomas or traditional healers know it as " unwele " , the great medicine that was used to ward off the effects of the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic which claimed 20 million lives worldwide .
the tswana people know it as " mukakana " for its power in treating gonorrhoea and syphilis , while the afrikaners call it the " kankerbossie " or cancer bush , because of its properties in treating people suffering with internal cancers and wasting .
molecular combination a local company specialising in the development of indigenous plant medicines , phyto nova , first started researching the bio-chemical properties of sutherlandia about three years ago .
a multi-disciplinary team headed by dr nigel gericke , a botanist , medical doctor and indigenous plant specialist , found that sutherlandia contained a powerful combination of molecules which have been identified and used in the treatment of patients with cancer tuberculosis , diabetes , schizophrenia and clinical depression and as an antiretroviral agent .
phyto nova were so convinced that sutherlandia could be used as a tonic for people infected with hiv and aids , that they contracted farmers to plant acres of the bush , to prevent wild supplies being over-harvested .
they have been manufacturing high quality sutherlandia tablets , gel and powder .
having determined that the product was safe when administered with a balanced food diet , the company distributed sutherlandia to aids patients .
quality of life " anecdotally we are accumulating evidence that wasted patients with aids , tb and cancer pick up weight , regain energy and appetite , " says dr gericke .
" the claim we are making on the basis of this , is that we can significantly and dramatically improve the quality of life of many ill aids patients ...
we are certainly not making the absurd claim that sutherlandia is a cure-all or a cure for aids . "
sutherlandia does not work properly just on a diet of porridge - you have to have vegetables virginia rathele nurse and sangoma whatever comes of the clinical trial , word of the plant 's properties is already spreading among south africa 's traditional healers .
at the same time as phyto nova was conducting its research , one of the country 's most venerated traditional healers , dr credo mutwa , 80 , was using sutherlandia to treat aids patients .
" my aunt minah , who is 103 years old , told me that we should use the great medicine against aids , " said dr mutwa .
" i said to her : ' but aunt , the white people tell us there is no cure for this disease ' .
" and my aunt said : ' for every disease there is a treatment .
try this medicine ' .
and i tried it . "
' near-miraculous ' " i have treated people who were told by the doctors at the hospital to ' go home and die ' and they are still alive today , three years after they should have died .
this plant is near-miraculous , i can say that with certainty , " he says .
testimony to the efficacy of the plant continues to mount .
anne hutchings , an ethno-botanist and lecturer at the university of zululand has been using sutherlandia , together with a range of other indigenous plant medicines , to treat aids patients who attend the weekly aids clinic at ngwelezane hospital .
she has 176 patients who all testify that sutherlandia has helped them to live a fuller , healthier and more productive life .
no response in the northern cape town of kuruman , nurse and sangoma , virginia rathele is using sutherlandia at her clinic to treat more than 300 aids patients .
she says an integral part of the treatment is to tell patients to eat healthily .
" sutherlandia does not work properly just on a diet of porridge .
you have to have vegetables , " she said .
one client , who weighed 26kg and was close to death in april this year , now weighs 45kg and is helping ms rathele run the clinic .
patents can not be taken out on plants which have well-documented folk use , which means that sutherlandia should remain accessible to anyone .
at present , one month 's supply of phyto nova tablets costs a little under $ 2.50 and two months ' supply of the powder form of the medication can be bought for under 50 cents .
phyto nova has approached the south african government in a bid to persuade them to grow the plant on a massive scale for use in public health treatment .
so far they have had no response .

a year after the two countries joined a new regional free trade area , zambian companies are battling with an endless supply of cheap goods pouring across the border from zimbabwe - ferried in on everything from trucks to overloaded bicycles .
in the southern zambian border town of livingstone , it is now difficult to find any local products on the shelves .
everything from beer to blankets comes from zimbabwe .
" we can not sell a single litre of our long life milk here in livingstone , " said ronny parbou , managing director of finta danish dairies , which is based in the town .
" tonnes of milk and other goods come across the border every day and they are half the price of our own products .
it is a horrific scenario . "
mismatch the low prices are largely the result of zimbabwe 's chronic shortage of foreign currency and the huge gap between its official exchange rate , which is pegged at 55 to the us dollar , and the black market rate , which has soared as high as 300 .
production has fallen by 45 % the disparity means zimbabwean companies exporting through normal channels are hit with a huge mismatch between what they earn and what they must pay out for raw materials .
add in a 40 % tax on foreign currency accounts , and exporting - even at knock-down rates - across the porous border into zambia looks like an increasingly attractive option .
and zambian traders can ship in goods from zimbabwe so cheaply that they price local products out of the market .
closing down unable to compete with the artificially low prices , companies across zambia are struggling .
in the northern town of ndola , lever brothers has closed its soap-making plant and is preparing to move to zimbabwe - and other plants may follow suit .
elsewhere the situation is no better .
zambia economy - source : cia world factbook gdp per capita - purchasing power parity - $ 880 budget revenues - $ 900m budget expenditure - $ 1bn industrial production growth rate 6.1 % -lrb- 2000 -rrb- exports - $ 928m imports - $ 6.5m import partners - zimbabwe , saudi arabia , south africa 48 % wandering around amanita 's huge cooking oil factory in the capital , lusaka , the company 's managing director , diego casilli , explains that production has fallen by 45 % .
the workforce has been halved to around 500 .
further cuts will be needed if it is to survive .
" we have been making losses for the past 12 months , " casilli said .
" if nothing is done , we might be forced to exit manufacturing completely and simply become traders . "
but nothing is being done .
the zambian government and officials from the regional trade organisation comesa -lrb- common market for east and southern africa -rrb- claim that they can not intervene because the imports to do not constitute illegal dumping .
action needed many businessmen see their point , but they argue that as zimbabwe refuses to import any goods from zambia urgent measures are necessary .
" this is a clear case of zimbabwe flouting trade rules but trying to prove it could take a year during which more zambian jobs will disappear , " said nelson chisenga , trade economist at the zambian chambers of commerce and industry .
" the government must act now .
zambia should flout the rules as well in order to save its remaining industries . "
zambian politicians and civil servants are currently obsessed with presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for 27 december .
meanwhile , the zimbabwean authorities show no signs of tackling the parallel exchange rates .
many zimbabwean businessmen suspect that there is no incentive to do so .
after all , the government pays z $ 55 for every us dollar , but the currency is fed back into the economy at z $ 300 .
" someone is profiting from the difference , and it 's certainly not us , " said one zimbabwean agricultural equipment distributor .
too little , too late ?
the best hope for zambian companies is probably for the economic and political turmoil in zimbabwe to worsen .
this would lead to a further reduction in manufacturing output and in exports .
but that might still come too late for many zambian companies and their employees .
" there are very few manufacturers left in livingstone and some , like the remaining blanket factories , are on the verge of closing down , " said finta 's ronny parbou .

zambia economy - source : cia world factbook gdp per capita - purchasing power parity - $ 880 budget revenues - $ 900m budget expenditure - $ 1bn industrial production growth rate 6.1 % -lrb- 2000 -rrb- exports - $ 928m imports - $ 6.5m import partners - zimbabwe , saudi arabia , south africa 48 % wandering around amanita 's huge cooking oil factory in the capital , lusaka , the company 's managing director , diego casilli , explains that production has fallen by 45 % .
the workforce has been halved to around 500 .
further cuts will be needed if it is to survive .
" we have been making losses for the past 12 months , " casilli said .
" if nothing is done , we might be forced to exit manufacturing completely and simply become traders . "
but nothing is being done .
the zambian government and officials from the regional trade organisation comesa -lrb- common market for east and southern africa -rrb- claim that they can not intervene because the imports to do not constitute illegal dumping .
action needed many businessmen see their point , but they argue that as zimbabwe refuses to import any goods from zambia urgent measures are necessary .
" this is a clear case of zimbabwe flouting trade rules but trying to prove it could take a year during which more zambian jobs will disappear , " said nelson chisenga , trade economist at the zambian chambers of commerce and industry .
" the government must act now .
zambia should flout the rules as well in order to save its remaining industries . "
zambian politicians and civil servants are currently obsessed with presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled for 27 december .
meanwhile , the zimbabwean authorities show no signs of tackling the parallel exchange rates .
many zimbabwean businessmen suspect that there is no incentive to do so .
after all , the government pays z $ 55 for every us dollar , but the currency is fed back into the economy at z $ 300 .
" someone is profiting from the difference , and it 's certainly not us , " said one zimbabwean agricultural equipment distributor .
too little , too late ?
the best hope for zambian companies is probably for the economic and political turmoil in zimbabwe to worsen .
this would lead to a further reduction in manufacturing output and in exports .
but that might still come too late for many zambian companies and their employees .
" there are very few manufacturers left in livingstone and some , like the remaining blanket factories , are on the verge of closing down , " said finta 's ronny parbou .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- ibm loses supercomputer crown categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 30 november , 2001 , 10:45 gmt ibm loses supercomputer crown terascale : power of 10,000 desktop pcs ibm has lost the supercomputer crown to compaq after holding the top slot for the last three years .
the new chart topper is a 3,024-processor compaq machine called terascale based at the pittsburgh supercomputing centre .
the terascale can perform six trillion calculations per second , the equivalent of 10,000 desktop pcs .
it relegated ibm 's asci white into second place following a chart shake-up based on a more sophisticated way of ranking of supercomputers .
experts say the new list compiled by research firm idc better represents real-world performance .
" the excessive focus on peak performance has contributed to a tendency for high-performance computing vendors to develop new generations of supercomputers showing impressive gains in peak performance while lagging behind in many critical system features , " said idc analyst debra goldfarb .
measuring performance many were dissatisfied with the way performance had been measured in the past .
previous lists were based on the linpack measurement , which measures how well processors work but excludes other factors , such as how fast data can be transferred from one part of the system to another .
experts were concerned that this was misleading , as it reflected peak performance , rather than how well the supercomputer worked in practice .
the new way of rating the performance of supercomputers includes the linpack measurement .
but it also measures several other elements : the processor 's mathematical abilities how fast the computer can transfer data to memory the total number of processors combined with the memory transfer capacity the new way of measuring the power of supercomputers is designed to help companies make better decisions when they consider which high-performance machine to purchase .
unlike the traditional supercomputer systems , today 's largest high-performance computers are built by coupling together many thousands of standard processors .
the terascale system uses technology developed in the uk to connect together its 3000 compaq alpha processors .

the new chart topper is a 3,024-processor compaq machine called terascale based at the pittsburgh supercomputing centre .
the terascale can perform six trillion calculations per second , the equivalent of 10,000 desktop pcs .
it relegated ibm 's asci white into second place following a chart shake-up based on a more sophisticated way of ranking of supercomputers .
experts say the new list compiled by research firm idc better represents real-world performance .
" the excessive focus on peak performance has contributed to a tendency for high-performance computing vendors to develop new generations of supercomputers showing impressive gains in peak performance while lagging behind in many critical system features , " said idc analyst debra goldfarb .
measuring performance many were dissatisfied with the way performance had been measured in the past .
previous lists were based on the linpack measurement , which measures how well processors work but excludes other factors , such as how fast data can be transferred from one part of the system to another .
experts were concerned that this was misleading , as it reflected peak performance , rather than how well the supercomputer worked in practice .
the new way of rating the performance of supercomputers includes the linpack measurement .
but it also measures several other elements : the processor 's mathematical abilities how fast the computer can transfer data to memory the total number of processors combined with the memory transfer capacity the new way of measuring the power of supercomputers is designed to help companies make better decisions when they consider which high-performance machine to purchase .
unlike the traditional supercomputer systems , today 's largest high-performance computers are built by coupling together many thousands of standard processors .
the terascale system uses technology developed in the uk to connect together its 3000 compaq alpha processors .
quadrics , based in bristol , designed the specialised switches which allow all the processors to talk to each other , as well as software that allows all the processors to co-operate on a single task .
as supercomputer systems continue to grow in size and power , the means to accommodate even larger processor counts will become increasingly critical .
