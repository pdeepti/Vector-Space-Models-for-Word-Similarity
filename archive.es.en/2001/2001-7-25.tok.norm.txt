"
the assembly 's draft strategy document had failed to take in the " big picture " in wales and focused too hard on minor detail , according to the confederation of british industry .
it is the second time this year the assembly has been criticised by commerce experts .
in march , the cbi and other industry groups threatened to withdraw co-operation with administration on the objective one regional aid scheme amid complaints over a lack of consultation .
first minister rhodri morgan said the assembly 's plans were only at a draft stage .
cbi wales director david rosser said the assembly 's economic draft document had " relied too much on relatively minor initiatives like trade missions . "
it has missed out on the big issues like education , transport and planning systems , he said .
fundamental measures " there are a lot of good measures being proposed in the draft economic strategy , " said mr rosser .
" but they are not enough by themselves - they wo n't replace having a fundamentally competitive business environment in wales .
" if we are to grow the economy to the step-change the assembly is saying we need to , we need to sort out the m4 around newport .
" we can not expect to grow the economy of wales by the extent we are aiming for and only have a two-lane motorway feeding 70 % of the population - the assembly needs to get to grips with the issues . "
comments rejected but first minister rhodri morgan rejected the comments , saying : " this is a draft economic strategy and if they feel strongly , then we will try to accommodate them when we have tested how widely felt that view is .
" we tried to focus on firms and clusters of companies driving the welsh economy up the value chain because we can no longer afford to be the lowest-cost producer in europe . "
the cbi is also angry the assembly is still considering plans for supplementary business rates after they were rejected in scotland and england .
mr morgan acknowleged the body 's concern and said : " everyone wants something akin to the american model of the business improvement districts , by which business can agree with a local council - on a voluntary basis - on areas that need improvement , to raise the tone of an area .
" everyone agrees on the desired outcome ; we 're not that far apart on the issue and no final decision has been made - it is just a matter of how you do it . "
transport talks on the attack of the assembly 's transport strategy , he said there was a europe-wide consensus , and an agreement after talks in kyoto , on developing new policy .
" it 's not a matter of the old days , in which the path to economic development was to build motorways right across the country .
" we ca n't do that anymore and we do n't have the money . "
mr morgan said the assembly administration might have a different view on plans to develop a relief road south of newport , for example , and said the emphasis on building roads of 25 years ago would never return .
but the cbi called for the assembly to " establish itself as a pro-business body - something it has not yet done " .

starr told reporters he did not believe weekend media reports that harrison was close to death , saying : " if he had been bad , he would have told me . "
harrison , 58 , who has been treated for cancer three times , had said he was " disappointed and disgusted " by the reports .
starr , harrison and sir paul mccartney are also considering another compilation album of hits after the success of 1 , the drummer told the access hollywood television show .
guitarist harrison was treated for a brain tumour last month and received treatment for lung cancer earlier this year and throat cancer in 1997 .
each time , he has claimed to have made a full recovery .
the news is real when either george tells me or paul tells me ringo starr but the mail on sunday newspaper quoted the band 's former producer sir george martin as saying harrison was prepared to die " soon " - although sir george later denied making the comments .
starr told the tv show that the reports did not worry him .
" i did n't panic because i will wait until it becomes a reality , " he said .
" the news is real when either george tells me or paul tells me .
" we do that to each other .
we say , ' watch out , something 's happened and they will be calling you ' .
harrison released a statement denying his imminent demise on monday .
" the reports were unsubstantiated , untrue , insensitive and uncalled for , " it said .
all starr tour harrison , whose life was threatened when he was stabbed by an intruder in 1999 , has blamed his health problems on smoking .
starr is about to begin an american tour with his all starr band , which includes greg lake of emerson , lake and palmer and roger hodgson of supertramp .
he also told the show that the three surviving beatles expect to discuss a 2 album later this year .
1 - which includes 27 of the band 's hits - was the uk 's best-selling album of 2000 , and has topped the music charts in more than 34 countries since its release related to this story : harrison 's disgust at death reports -lrb- 23 jul 01 -pipe- music -rrb- harrison calms health fears -lrb- 09 jul 01 -pipe- music -rrb- ex-beatle harrison treated for cancer -lrb- 03 may 01 -pipe- entertainment -rrb- george harrison : the quiet beatle -lrb- 15 nov 00 -pipe- uk -rrb- the beatles ' separate paths -lrb- 30 dec 99 -pipe- music -rrb- harrison guitar left gently weeping -lrb- 20 aug 99 -pipe- entertainment -rrb- beatle 's attacker ' insane ' -lrb- 16 nov 00 -pipe- uk -rrb- beatle 's mental health law warning -lrb- 17 dec 00 -pipe- health -rrb- inquiry launched into beatle 's attacker -lrb- 16 nov 00 -pipe- uk -rrb- internet links : george harrison albums , songs and lyrics -pipe- ringo starr and the all starr band -pipe- the beatles official website -pipe- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- entertainment contents : showbiz -pipe- music -pipe- film -pipe- arts -pipe- tv and radio -pipe- new media -pipe- reviews -pipe- back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- ©

the sale has raised hopes that the international monetary fund will release fresh funds to help the turkish economy , which has been in crisis in the last few months .
the value of the turkish currency , the lira , has plunged on international markets , while the imf has insisted that the turkish government complete controversial plans to privatise its banking and transport sectors .
the government 's sale of its debt - at a lower interest rate than expected - has been taken as a sign of market approval for turkey 's reforms ahead of the visit on 30 july to ankara of imf deputy director stanley fischer .
breathing space he is expected to use the visit to make a public display of solidarity , and suggest that the disagreements over the imf 's deal with turkey are over .
the positive mood triggered by the auction saw the lira strengthen and the turkish stock market end the day higher , as dealers gave the government a breathing space to implement economic reforms .
imf 's fischer : in turkey to offer support comments from us treasury secretary paul o 'neill in london also reinforced sentiment , as he cast doubt on investors ' concerns about " contagion " of problems spreading from one emerging market , like argentina , to others .
" with a magnifying glass , you could n't find a connection between turkey and argentina , except in people 's minds , " he said .
turkey 's economy is labouring under sky-high inflation , and corporate bankruptcies and compulsory redundancies are rife .
government debt has almost tripled in the first six months of this year to 92,000 trillion lira .
suspension in june , the imf suspended its $ 15bn loan programme following allegations of foot-dragging on agreed reforms .
the programme was restarted with the release of $ 3.2bn in imf and world bank loans on 12 july after one of the main opponents in the government of the imf plan was sacked .
the communications minister , enis oksuz , had refused to accept privatisation of state telecoms company turk telecom on national security grounds , and had become a symbol of nationalist scepticism about the imf agreement as a whole .

others have taken to sunday racing , often with funfairs and other attractions , to offer a more family-orientated day out .
uk racing , 2000 59 racecourses 1,142 meetings 323 days racing five million racegoers women accounted for 40 % of racegoers and 10 % of betting shop customers racing and breeding supported 60,000 jobs another 40,000 employed in the betting industry , which relies on racing for 70 % of turnover source : bhb but this month has seen the launch of an unprecedented £ 10m marketing campaign aimed at raising the profile of all 59 uk racecourses and lifting annual attendances by one million within three years .
" racing needs to look towards the commercial future ... and become more competitive , " says sue willies of the discover racing campaign .
she says discover racing 's research has revealed a lot of people are interested in going racing but " do n't know how to " because of a lack of information .
over the course of the next year , during which one meeting at each racecourse will be targeted , the campaign hopes to change that .
best gate in one of the first such mini-campaigns , discover racing took 700 bookings via its website and call centre for a meeting at salisbury earlier this month .
with 5,700 racegoers in total , attendance was up about 60 % on the same meeting last year .
racing is not deriving the return -lsb- from the betting industry -rsb- it is entitled to alan delmonte , bhb " it was the best gate they 've had in years , " says ms willies .
" and not only did we increase sales , we increased awareness in the area . "
three days ago , the discover racing campaign helped southwell stage its best-attended meeting for a decade .
-lrb- and visitors to the nottinghamshire track were not let down as famous loser quixall crossett ran a record 100th consecutive race without winning to claim a small piece of racing history . -rrb-
underfunded overall attendances at uk racecourses stood at about five million in 2000 , marginally down on the previous year 's figure , which had been the best since the mid-1960s .
alan delmonte of the british horseracing board -lrb- bhb -rrb- , racing 's governing body , says the sport has worked hard in recent years to fight for its place in the leisure market and been rewarded with substantially higher attendances .
but he says racing remains chronically underfunded , principally because of the levy system under which a fixed -lrb- low -rrb- percentage of betting turnover is returned to racing .
" racing is not deriving the return that it is entitled to , " he says .
it deserves " proper value " for its rights .
as part of reforms , the government last year said it would abolish the levy system , instead allowing racing to open direct commercial negotiations with the betting industry for the use of racing 's rights .
but change has been slower than the bhb would like .
" we were disappointed that there was nothing in the queen 's speech setting out the timing for a bill , " says mr delmonte .
modest prize money he says that racing as a whole loses about £ 200m a year , the vast majority of which is borne by racehorse owners .
this is partly because relatively modest prize money rarely gets anywhere near repaying costs associated with keeping a horse in training .
as for individual racecourses , any profits are " much lower than could be expected in a normal commercial environment " .
despite this , says mr delmonte , no uk racecourse has gone bust since the early 1980s and every fixture now staged brings in more money to racing than it costs to put on .
if diversifying into other entertainment is one way of helping achieve this , that 's fine by the bhb .
" what we 'd like is for people to go for the racing .
but it 's perfectly sensible -lsb- to expect -rsb- that people who go for concerts may be interested in coming back again , " says mr delmonte .
" the proof that it works is that racecourses continue to do it . "

the rich countries certainly hope so , and the most powerful of them , the g7 , said as much when their leaders met in genoa . .
the organisation 's director general , mike moore , is due to make an assessment of whether it is feasible - what he calls a ' reality check ' - at the end of july .
it is understandable that he should want to do that .
the last time the wto tried to launch a new round , was at the previous ministerial meeting in seattle in 1999 .
it was a humiliating failure .
demonstrations which ensured that the international media were watching closely the wto 's member countries could not agree on the negotiating agenda for a round .
the failure was all the more public because of the massive anti-wto demonstrations which ensured that the international media were watching closely .
mike moore does not want a repeat .
he wants to ensure that the wto 's members go into the doha meeting with realistic expectations about what they are likely to achieve .
new trade round one fundamental difference remains from seattle .
the rich countries want a new trade round .
the developing countries are much more sceptical .
they have other priorities , although most would probably accept a round if it had the right agenda .
for the developing world , there are more pressing issues concerning previous wto agreements .
together they are labelled ' implementation ' .
there is a whole raft of concerns .
for some governments there is an issue just about having the capacity - the civil servants with the right skills for example - to implement complex agreements .
intellectual property - such as patents , and copyright - is another bugbear .
the issue has become politically charged in relation to medicines and issues of the cost of drugs still under patent that can treat diseases such as hiv / aids that are serious public health problems in the developing countries .
but there are wider concerns about the intellectual property rules obstructing technology transfer for example .
meeting in zanzibar this week , many of the world 's poorest developing countries have adopted a cautious approach to endorsing a new trade round .
dumping developing countries are also very concerned about an arcane set of rules about what is called dumping - when companies sell goods abroad for less than it costs to produce them .
the wto allows countries to impose duties when they think they are victims of unfair dumping .
many developing countries think this is abused to provide protection for rich countries ' industry .
they are particularly concerned about textiles and clothing , which are important for many in the third world ..
the rich countries are having to phase out restrictions on imports of these goods , and might resort to a barrage of anti-dumping cases instead , or so developing countries fear .
the united states is by far the biggest user of anti-dumping provisions .
and this week the eu and nine other countries went to the world trade organisation to launch a formal complaint about us dumping law .
wide-ranging agenda the rich countries want more negotiations on reducing tariffs .
they also want to make more of environmental issues in the wto .
some developing countries are very suspicious that that might be used against them as a cover for ' green protectionism ' - using environmental concerns as an excuse for restricting imports .
the rich countries also want to make more of the negotiations already taking place on services .
that is their economic strength and they see more opportunities to export services if wto deals can sweep away restrictions .
the european union is keen to have a round discuss competition policy - rules against monopolies and restrictive business practices .
the lack of such regulation can make it harder for imported to get into new markets .
europe is particularly enthusiastic about having a wide ranging round , probably to divert attention from the cuts in farm support it will have to make , which will infuriate european farmers .
talks about talks reconciling all these concerns will be quite a task .
and it is not as if they are negotiating real agreements to open markets .
all they are trying to agree is an agenda of what to talk about .
if there is a round launched in doha , it will take years to complete .
if it happens , mike moore is convinced it will be real benefit for the world economy .

the rich countries certainly hope so , and the most powerful of them , the g7 , said as much when their leaders met in genoa . .
the organisation 's director general , mike moore , is due to make an assessment of whether it is feasible - what he calls a ' reality check ' - at the end of july .
it is understandable that he should want to do that .
the last time the wto tried to launch a new round , was at the previous ministerial meeting in seattle in 1999 .
it was a humiliating failure .
the wto 's member countries could not agree on the negotiating agenda for a round .
the failure was all the more public because of the massive anti-wto demonstrations which ensured that the international media were watching closely .
mike moore does not want a repeat .
he wants to ensure that the wto 's members go into the doha meeting with realistic expectations about what they are likely to achieve .
new trade round one fundamental difference remains from seattle .
the rich countries want a new trade round .
the developing countries are much more sceptical .
they have other priorities , although most would probably accept a round if it had the right agenda .
for the developing world , there are more pressing issues concerning previous wto agreements .
together they are labelled ' implementation ' .
there is a whole raft of concerns .
for some governments there is an issue just about having the capacity - the civil servants with the right skills for example - to implement complex agreements .
intellectual property - such as patents , and copyright - is another bugbear .
the issue has become politically charged in relation to medicines and issues of the cost of drugs still under patent that can treat diseases such as hiv / aids that are serious public health problems in the developing countries .
but there are wider concerns about the intellectual property rules obstructing technology transfer for example .
meeting in zanzibar this week , many of the world 's poorest developing countries have adopted a cautious approach to endorsing a new trade round .
dumping developing countries are also very concerned about an arcane set of rules about what is called dumping - when companies sell goods abroad for less than it costs to produce them .
the wto allows countries to impose duties when they think they are victims of unfair dumping .
many developing countries think this is abused to provide protection for rich countries ' industry .
they are particularly concerned about textiles and clothing , which are important for many in the third world ..
the rich countries are having to phase out restrictions on imports of these goods , and might resort to a barrage of anti-dumping cases instead , or so developing countries fear .
the united states is by far the biggest user of anti-dumping provisions .
and this week the eu and nine other countries went to the world trade organisation to launch a formal complaint about us dumping law .
wide-ranging agenda the rich countries want more negotiations on reducing tariffs .
they also want to make more of environmental issues in the wto .
some developing countries are very suspicious that that might be used against them as a cover for ' green protectionism ' - using environmental concerns as an excuse for restricting imports .
the rich countries also want to make more of the negotiations already taking place on services .
that is their economic strength and they see more opportunities to export services if wto deals can sweep away restrictions .
the european union is keen to have a round discuss competition policy - rules against monopolies and restrictive business practices .
the lack of such regulation can make it harder for imported to get into new markets .
europe is particularly enthusiastic about having a wide ranging round , probably to divert attention from the cuts in farm support it will have to make , which will infuriate european farmers .
talks about talks reconciling all these concerns will be quite a task .
and it is not as if they are negotiating real agreements to open markets .
all they are trying to agree is an agenda of what to talk about .
if there is a round launched in doha , it will take years to complete .
if it happens , mike moore is convinced it will be real benefit for the world economy .
eliminating all remaining trade restrictions would be like adding two economies the size of china to the world , he says .
even if there is a new round , it wo n't be that far reaching - all the same mike moore thinks it could make a real difference .

spare a thought for the air traffic controllers juggling up to a dozen planes at a time , writes bbc news online 's megan lane .
it 's a familiar scene at airports around the nation .
as packed planes park up on the tarmac waiting for a take-off slot , planes stack up in the skies above waiting clearance to land .
crowded skies 180m passengers in uk in 2000 , up 7 % on 1999 biggest rises at stansted , up 26 % , and luton , 18 % scottish airports had 11.6 % rise and things look set to get worse as the holiday season reaches its peak .
delays and cancellations seem inevitable .
over july and august , some six million britons jet off to the mediterranean in search of sun .
and it 's up to increasingly overworked air traffic controllers to guide the planes through the crowded skies over europe .
all-day rush hour laurence king , chairman of the controllers branch of the ipms union , says fatigue and work-related stress are commonplace .
' ' in the past we used to have a summer peak and then a winter lull when you could recharge your batteries .
you do n't get that any more .
" the winter levels now are about equivalent to the summer traffic of three years ago , so you 're going full pelt all the year , and it 's beginning to tell . "
not only are the skies full year-round , planes are now coming and going thick and fast around the clock .
" it 's becoming a younger person 's job - most controllers are planning to retire well before 60 , " says mr king , who controls en route flights at manchester .
filling the skies with the system working at near-capacity , aircraft have to stay on the ground until it 's safe to fly - in other words , controllers create congestion to avoid air traffic jams .
in the first three months of this year , almost one in four flights in the uk took off more than 15 minutes after the expected departure .
that compares to one in 10 flights seven years ago .
although air traffic control accounts for more than half of all delays , mr king says a hold-up may well be down to a passenger dawdling through duty-free , delays in stowing luggage , or nasty weather .
" it pains us to talk about delays - it 's a source of professional pride to get flights off in time .
but if a plane misses its slot , chances are that the next slots will already be filled . "
then there 's the complex system within europe - currently being streamlined - where 55 air traffic control centres supervise about 1,000 sectors of air space .
controllers in the united states , by comparison , supervise twice as many flights from 20 centres .
cracks showing with the number of flights in and out of the uk set to double to about four million by 2015 , the infrastructure is already straining under pressure .
to pay for the upgrades needed to keep pace , the government has embarked on a controversial part-privatisation of the national air traffic control system .
a consortium of leading airlines plans to buy a 46 % stake , but this has been delayed by a last-minute hitch on price .
at issue is the amount to be invested in a new flight data processing system -lrb- to replace the one that broke down last summer -rrb- and in the new nerve centre at swanwick , hampshire , due to open in january , five years behind schedule .
cruise control although swanwick has new electronic tools to predict flight paths - and possible trouble spots - to make controllers ' jobs easier , the training required takes staff out of circulation .
so how true to life is the film , pushing tin , in which macho controllers push themselves - and the air space available - to the limit ?
as with any hollywood concoction , it 's something of an exaggeration .
yes , it can be frantic , mr king says , but controllers have to co-operate , not compete .
" you have to know how the person controlling the sector next to yours is going to react .
air traffic control is like a game of four-dimensional chess , except you 're all on the same side . "

controllers fear airlines will lay off staff to cut costs to pay for the upgrades needed to keep pace , the government has embarked on a controversial part-privatisation of the national air traffic control system .
a consortium of leading airlines plans to buy a 46 % stake , but this has been delayed by a last-minute hitch on price .
at issue is the amount to be invested in a new flight data processing system -lrb- to replace the one that broke down last summer -rrb- and in the new nerve centre at swanwick , hampshire , due to open in january , five years behind schedule .
cruise control although swanwick has new electronic tools to predict flight paths - and possible trouble spots - to make controllers ' jobs easier , the training required takes staff out of circulation .
john cusack starred as a stressed controller so how true to life is the film , pushing tin , in which macho controllers push themselves - and the air space available - to the limit ?
as with any hollywood concoction , it 's something of an exaggeration .
yes , it can be frantic , mr king says , but controllers have to co-operate , not compete .
" you have to know how the person controlling the sector next to yours is going to react .
air traffic control is like a game of four-dimensional chess , except you 're all on the same side . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- is the uk heading for recession ? low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo wednesday , 25 july , 2001 , 09:13 gmt 10:13 uk is the uk heading for recession ?
damage initially contained in the manufacturing sector is spreading as evidence of a world economic slowdown mounts , the bbc 's economics reporter dharshini david examines whether the uk could be heading into the red .
since the start of the year , the global downturn has intensified , and concerns over a recession in the united states have grown .
most experts still claim that the uk , thanks to its sturdy domestic economy , will not suffer greatly .
the picture will become clearer on friday , when figures for gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in both the uk and the us are released for the second three months of the year .
the consensus is that economic growth in the uk will remain at about 2 % , allowing the longest period of economic expansion since the war to continue .
changeable weather ?
however , like weather forecasters , economists have been known to fail to spot major storms on the horizon before .
and in recent weeks , there have been some ominous clouds gathering .
house prices have on average risen by £ 20 per day the us economy has slowed down and demand for uk exports has weakened .
likewise , the number of profit warnings issued by companies in the uk has risen sharply .
hardest hit , as in the us , have been high tech firms and industry .
several high profile companies have cut output , and their workforces - and are doing so with increased frequency .
spreading from manufacturing the damage may initially have been contained largely in the manufacturing sector , which accounts for a just a fifth of the economy , but it could be spreading .
according to a survey from the british chambers of commerce , some parts of the service sector , particularly those linked to manufacturing , are now feeling the pinch .
the worry is that the slowdown could spread further .
according to forecasters at the item club , weak global demand and the pound 's strength against the euro could affect output , investment and eventually jobs across the board .
once concerns about job security set in , consumers are less likely to spend .
consumer spending consumer spending is the key to keeping the economy on an even keel .
admittedly , there are other factors influencing spending .
falling share prices in recent months may have affected households ' wealth .
but individuals in the uk hold far more of their wealth in the form of property than shares .
and according to nationwide figures , house prices have on average risen by £ 20 per day over the past year in the uk .
however , according to data from research group cambridge econometrics , they may not rise much further .
they claim that in london , prices are almost five times as high as income on average - a level last seen just prior to the collapse of the market in the late 1980s .
in other words , buyers may be priced out of the market , ultimately forcing prices down .
gloom overdone ?
several factors suggest such gloom may be overdone .
consumer spending so far shows little sign of faltering .
admittedly , high street sales failed to rise last month for the first time in more than a year .
but one month 's data does n't make a trend , and sales remain more than 5 % higher than a year ago - hardly evidence of nervous consumers .
in addition the bank of england has cut interest rates relatively early in the economic cycle .
the rate setters themselves admit this was a deliberate move to bolster domestic demand , to insulate the economy from the global slowdown .
moreover , chancellor gordon brown is injecting many billion pounds more of public money into the economy over the next few years to boost investment in public services .
this can only stimulate growth in the economy .
and it may not be over for the housing market yet .
low mortgage rates and the growing availability of generous loans mean that housing remains affordable .
turning to property the market has received a boost from an additional source .
with lower interest rates and a faltering stock market , many investors are turning instead to property , thereby pushing prices up .
in this case , the result would be a continuation of a two-speed economy .
it is not an ideal situation , but as long as the bank of england does n't feel it needs to put up interest rates to prevent spending reaching inflationary levels , then growth in the economy as a whole could well continue .
of course , there could still be a bumpy ride ahead .
the risks are numerous .
the bank of england has said it is monitoring the situation and remains poised to change rates - a sign of just how precarious and uncertain the situation is .
but the uk economy remains better positioned than most to weather the storm of the global slowdown .

reducing carbon dioxide emissions could itself become big business in the uk if it gains the upper hand in buying and selling of the greenhouse gas .
where there 's muck there 's brass - even when the waste product in question can not be seen .
the -lrb- almost -rrb- international push to reduce emissions of the " greenhouse " gas carbon dioxide in accordance with the kyoto climate treaty could prove to be a money spinner for some .
soon to be trading in hot air ?
as a sweetener to the heavily-industrialised nations who have to make the deepest cuts in their release of the gas blamed for global warming , a system of so-called " carbon trading " has been endorsed .
companies that cut their co2 emissions below the cap decided by their government will be able to sell their surplus allowance to local or foreign businesses unable or unwilling to meet their own emissions targets .
the united states already operates a similar " cap and trade " system to control sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide output .
with the nation being the biggest co2 producer , american commodity trading firms had been expecting the domestic carbon market to be worth perhaps $ 60bn a year .
trading places however , president bush has stepped away from the kyoto treaty for fear his nation 's economic growth could be threatened by its implementation .
the detrimental effect of kyoto on the us economy has been disputed , with un economist dr. florentin krause estimating that the full raft of emissions measures -lrb- including carbon trading -rrb- could have seen us gross domestic product rise by up to 1 % .
however , the departure of the us strengthens the hand of london as the would-be home of international carbon trading and may put the uk ahead of the game in co2 emissions technology .
carbon trading could help deliver low-cost emission cuts uk environment minister michael meacher , returning from the bonn climate change conference , says he will push through the legislation to establish a domestic carbon trading market as soon as possible .
trading requires legally binding emission targets to be set , co2 monitoring to be established and a system of enforcement to be created .
biting the bullet early on may actually benefit uk businesses in the long run , says kpmg sustainability advisor melanie eddis .
" there 's a huge advantage to be the first to put in place a trading system . "
british companies will be able to export any emissions-cutting techniques they pioneer and may even be first to benefit from selling surplus co2 allowances once a european or global market develops .
trading on the future co2e.com , a company already trading in carbon " futures " , estimates a tonne of actual carbon dioxide could change hands for $ 10 .
with the eu producing 3,171 million tonnes of co2 , the potential trading market is massive .
there could be some " carbon millionaires " , says ms eddis , though the profits of middlemen should n't detract from the widely held belief that carbon trading is the most effective way to push businesses to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
" of course , many environmentalists do n't like to see people making money out of pollution , " she says .
one such critic is the green campaigner george monbiot , who calls the whole idea of trading is " grossly unjust " since it will allow polluters to buy their way out of their responsibilities .

bbc news online 's ian youngs was there to witness the star turn on the style .
" this is a public announcement .
we regret that robbie williams will not be appearing . "
a stunned silence spread across the 65,000 fans gathered at milton keynes bowl - followed by a collective sigh of relief when they realised that the posh-sounding announcement must be one of robbie 's little jokes .
" this is a public announcement .
robbie williams has requested that no-one look at him during the performance . "
i 'll dedicate this one to mark owen , howard donald , gary barlow and ...
i 've forgotten the other fella 's name robbie williams robbie did appear , and did not seem to mind one bit if we looked at him , sang along with his hits or even cheered ecstatically from time to time .
the first glimpse fans got of him on this date of his current uk tour was when he was lowered onto the stage on a rope .
dressed in a black suit and dark glasses , he immediately started striking cocky poses - and maybe the talk of him wanting to be the next james bond is not so wide of the mark after all .
his fans had snapped up all the tickets for this show months ago , many had been waiting in the amphitheatre all day .
and robbie 's appearance soon dispelled any gloom that the constant drizzle and support band toploader might have brought on .
the entertainer when robbie struck out with the intro to the first song , let me entertain you , the crown began bouncing up and down like the floor had suddenly caught fire , showing that robbie can still brighten up his fans ' lives , let alone damp evenings in milton keynes .
immediately acting the fool , the former take that singer began cossack dancing , aping around and generally making an ass of himself .
he has said that he finds gigs " traumatic " - and somehow seemed ill at ease with the adulation of so many baying fans , most of whom were young and female .
the suspicions that he may turn into a sinatra-style crooner were reinforced it must be a hard life .
but he soon loosened up , prancing through hits like let love be your energy , old before i die and better man .
as he got more relaxed , so he became more chatty , even indulging in some one-on-one audience interaction .
" they 're a class pair they are , love , " he told a female fan who had gone to revealing lengths to get noticed .
" i 'll see you backstage after . "
cheeky chappy he may be - but he made an effort to point out that he is not the clean-cut family entertainer some may think he is .
" if there are any young folk , and you 're confused about what these swearwords are , you can ask your parents later , " he said by way of apology for his bad language .
few of his songs could not be described as crowd favourites , and those that went down best included supreme , she 's the one and eternity - which , as he made sure we were aware , is the current number one .
he has talked about re-inventing his image , and the suspicions that he may turn into a sinatra-style crooner were reinforced when he broke into an impromptu rendition of ol ' blue eyes ' one for my baby .
one for the boys but he later went in the opposite musical direction , appearing in a nu-metal get-up and treating the crowd to a live premiere of his version of limp bizkit 's rollin ' .
and he proved scarily adept at the whole nu-metal thing .
but he did not forget his roots .
well , he did not forget most of them .
" i 'll dedicate this one to mark owen , howard donald , gary barlow and ...
i 've forgotten the other fella 's name , " he said by way of introduction to a bizarre half-mumbled , half-heavy rock version of take that 's hit back for good .
saving the best for last , angels and rock dj preceded a cover of queen 's we are the champions , which he recently recorded for a film soundtrack .
there were not as many costume changes as madonna , but we forgave him that along with his extravagances and indulgences - because they make such good viewing .
he wanted us to let him entertain us - and we allowed him that too .

" this is a public announcement .
we regret that robbie williams will not be appearing . "
a stunned silence spread across the 65,000 fans gathered at milton keynes bowl - followed by a collective sigh of relief when they realised that the posh-sounding announcement must be one of robbie 's little jokes .
" this is a public announcement .
robbie williams has requested that no-one look at him during the performance . "
i 'll dedicate this one to mark owen , howard donald , gary barlow and ...
i 've forgotten the other fella 's name robbie williams robbie did appear , and did not seem to mind one bit if we looked at him , sang along with his hits or even cheered ecstatically from time to time .
the first glimpse fans got of him on this date of his current uk tour was when he was lowered onto the stage on a rope .
dressed in a black suit and dark glasses , he immediately started striking cocky poses - and maybe the talk of him wanting to be the next james bond is not so wide of the mark after all .
his fans had snapped up all the tickets for this show months ago , many had been waiting in the amphitheatre all day .
and robbie 's appearance soon dispelled any gloom that the constant drizzle and support band toploader might have brought on .
the entertainer when robbie struck out with the intro to the first song , let me entertain you , the crown began bouncing up and down like the floor had suddenly caught fire , showing that robbie can still brighten up his fans ' lives , let alone damp evenings in milton keynes .
immediately acting the fool , the former take that singer began cossack dancing , aping around and generally making an ass of himself .
he has said that he finds gigs " traumatic " - and somehow seemed ill at ease with the adulation of so many baying fans , most of whom were young and female .
the suspicions that he may turn into a sinatra-style crooner were reinforced it must be a hard life .
but he soon loosened up , prancing through hits like let love be your energy , old before i die and better man .
as he got more relaxed , so he became more chatty , even indulging in some one-on-one audience interaction .
" they 're a class pair they are , love , " he told a female fan who had gone to revealing lengths to get noticed .
" i 'll see you backstage after . "
cheeky chappy he may be - but he made an effort to point out that he is not the clean-cut family entertainer some may think he is .
" if there are any young folk , and you 're confused about what these swearwords are , you can ask your parents later , " he said by way of apology for his bad language .
few of his songs could not be described as crowd favourites , and those that went down best included supreme , she 's the one and eternity - which , as he made sure we were aware , is the current number one .
he has talked about re-inventing his image , and the suspicions that he may turn into a sinatra-style crooner were reinforced when he broke into an impromptu rendition of ol ' blue eyes ' one for my baby .
one for the boys but he later went in the opposite musical direction , appearing in a nu-metal get-up and treating the crowd to a live premiere of his version of limp bizkit 's rollin ' .
and he proved scarily adept at the whole nu-metal thing .
but he did not forget his roots .
well , he did not forget most of them .
" i 'll dedicate this one to mark owen , howard donald , gary barlow and ...
i 've forgotten the other fella 's name , " he said by way of introduction to a bizarre half-mumbled , half-heavy rock version of take that 's hit back for good .
saving the best for last , angels and rock dj preceded a cover of queen 's we are the champions , which he recently recorded for a film soundtrack .
there were not as many costume changes as madonna , but we forgave him that along with his extravagances and indulgences - because they make such good viewing .
he wanted us to let him entertain us - and we allowed him that too .

the 25 paintings , by picasso , miró , magritte , braque and renoir , were part of the collection of the late rené gaffé .
the belgian journalist died in 1968 , but his second wife - jeanne - left the works to the un children 's fund after her death last october .
the paintings are " exceptional in their quality and their state , " said thomas seydoux , director of the impressionist and modern art department at christie 's , who will conduct the sale on 6 november .
the collection , which has been held at the gaffé villa in southwest france , includes several paintings that have not been seen in public .
huge canvases included in the group is picasso 's 1908 cubist étude pour nu dans une foret , once owned by the writer gertrude stein and expected to go for more than $ 5m -lrb- £ 3.5m -rrb- .
also for auction will be a portrait by magritte of his friend gaffé , who founded the french language daily l 'echo belge .
two huge canvases by spanish painter joan miró are each valued at $ 7m -lrb- £ 5m -rrb- .
" paintings that are in perfect condition , of prime importance for art , which have never been sold before , will be an unbelievable force on the current market , " said seydoux .
an additional gaffé collection , of primitive art , will be auctioned by christie 's in paris in aid of the french cancer charity , l 'institut curie , on 8 december .
that collection is expected to make $ 3.9m -lrb- £ 2.7m -rrb- .
impoverished there are reports that unicef may have chosen to auction the more valuable collection outside of france in order to avoid the " droit de suite " tax which is in force in that country .
in france , as in many eu countries , 5 % of the price of every piece of art sold goes to the artist or to their family up to 70 years after the artist 's death .
the idea is to give some of the benefit of their work to impoverished artists whose work begins to sell for enormous sums either later in life or after their death .
the uk had hitherto avoided eu attempts to impose the tax but from 1 january 2006 it will come into force in this country .
the government has vigorously opposed the tax , which art dealers claim will send art works for sale outside the eu , damaging the uk 's thriving art market .
in this case unicef was anxious to maximise the money it makes from the sale .
" the profits of this sale will help millions of children throughout the world , to be immunized , to go to school , and to grow to adulthood in health , peace and dignity , " said carol bellamy , director general of unicef .

news of the fighting inflamed an already dangerous mood in the capital , skopje , following riots targeting nato and international mediators accused of supporting the rebels .
tetovo 's streets are reported to be almost deserted the macedonian government is insisting the albanian rebels must withdraw to their positions of two weeks ago , when a nato-arranged ceasefire was agreed .
however , our correspondent says rebel forces have proved they can move in and out of parts of the tetovo - which they regard as their unofficial capital - and say they are ready to take the city if need be , to protect albanian citizens who live there .
who is protecting the terrorists ? - nato skopje banner for the government , that is unacceptable and officials are warning of a possible all-out offensive .
the rebels ' attack on tetovo , macedonia 's second largest city , began against an army barracks in the north of the city .
heavy explosions lightly-armed macedonian police abandoned several checkpoints and were replaced by rebels , macedonian media reported .
a macedonian defence official said : " the terrorists began attacks on almost all police checkpoints with machineguns and mortars " .
heavy explosions and bursts of gunfire could be heard just 200 metres from the town centre as fighting continued into the night .
on wednesday , tetovo 's streets were reportedly almost deserted , with hundreds of residents fleeing the city and surrounding villages , several of which are thought to be under rebel control .
in skopje crowds ran through its streets on tuesday , attacking international organisations and criticising nato-led efforts to broker peace .
pullout threat about 3,000 people protested in front of the parliament building , unfurling a banner that read , " who is protecting the terrorists ? - nato . "
the british and german embassies were attacked , and three cars were set alight outside the european security organisation , the osce .
the local head of the osce said the body would pull out of macedonia if its staff were endangered .
later , protesters pelted the us embassy , smashing windows .
a heavy force of riot police ringing the complex did not intervene .
macedonians protest at peace proposals nato officials have denied providing any backing to the rebels .
the united states and other countries in the western alliance have repeatedly pledged their support to the macedonian government and have supported its refusal to negotiate directly with the rebels .
meanwhile , us president george w bush , who visited us troops in kosovo , called on both sides to maintain the two-week-old ceasefire .
" those here in kosovo who support the insurgency in macedonia are hurting the interests of ethnic albanians throughout the region , " the president said in a statement .
dangerous mood the new violence came as macedonia closed its border with kosovo following a row between the government in skopje and international peace negotiators .
it is the first time macedonia has shut the border since march - a measure which led to international criticism .
tuesday 's move appeared to be linked to reports that us envoy james pardew and eu mediator francois leotard had blamed macedonian security forces for breaking the 19-day-old ceasefire .
macedonian government spokesman antonio milosovski said the two men had shown themselves to be biased .
he also said nato was helping rebels pursue their separatist ambitions .
the two negotiators rejected the allegations outright .
but western diplomats are thought to be increasingly frustrated by hard-liners in the macedonian government stopping the peace process moving forward .
the militants launched their insurgency in february , saying they were fighting for greater rights for ethnic albanians , who account for up to a third of macedonia 's two million people .
the government alleges the rebels are linked to militants in neighboring kosovo and accuses them of trying to carve out territory from macedonia .
