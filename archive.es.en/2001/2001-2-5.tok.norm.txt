financial and business advice firm grant thornton has issued a report which suggests the overall failure rate rose by over 70 % last year .
the rise is being largely attributed to a new determination among banks to recover debts from business customers .
some 67 % of the failures were caused by banks pulling the plug on struggling companies , suggesting lenders are tightening their grip ahead of the expected economic slowdown .
construction has been badly hit the pattern of business failures also reveals distinct differences between different parts of the country .
in the uk as a whole the trend is downward , but in scotland only lothian recorded fewer failures than previously .
grampian and tayside recorded major increases , and strathclyde , which accounted for over half of the scottish insolvencies , also saw a rise .
a grant thornton spokesman said the figures showed conditions were becoming more difficult for scottish businesses .
he added that construction and property have been particularly badly hit .
the total number of uk receiverships went down from 967 in 1999 to 872 in 2000 .
salvage efforts the uk wide results also showed the construction industry improving on the previous year 's performance , despite the problems in scotland .
mike jervis , a receivership expert with the firm , said : " the figures provide an interesting snapshot of the fortunes of uk industry .
there is a global downward trend in receiverships , fuelled in part by the banks ' work in salvaging viable businesses before they fold .
" turn-around solutions are appropriate when business confidence is high , for example where new equity can be raised , subsidiaries disposed of and management teams strengthened .
" how this will hold up if the climate changes dramatically remains to be seen . "

the gujarat authorities said on monday they planned to set up tent cities , complete with medical facilities , shops and markets , for hundreds of thousands of people made homeless .
gujarat 's home minister , haren pandya , said 70,000 tents had already been distributed but twice that number were needed .
the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies says many people who fled the city of bhuj , in gujarat , which was hardest hit by the quake , were afraid to return because of the threat of disease .
a bbc correspondent in bhuj says the challenge is to rebuild civil society almost from scratch .
economic activity has dried up completely in the area and people are entirely dependent on relief aid .
indian defence minister george fernandez , who visited the ruins of bhuj on monday , said he doubted whether the final death toll would ever be known .
disease threat there have been fears of potential outbreaks of diseases like typhoid and cholera .
local authorities have been conducting an aggressive campaign of spraying dead bodies with chemicals as they are uncovered in an effort to contain possible epidemics .
the myth about dead bodies is so deeply ingrained ... but we need to take into account with things which are priorities who spokesman however , a spokesman for the world health organisation , gregory hartl , stress that the greatest danger is posed not by corpses but by disruption to clean water supplies .
" bodies do not cause any sort of disease , if a person did not have any sort of disease when alive , " mr hartl told the bbc .
" when a person dies the virus can not survive more than a short time afterwards . "
aid agencies say there are no signs of epidemics developing yet .
at least 30,000 people are estimated to have died in the quake , which measured 7.9 on the richter scale .
another 55,000 have been injured and about half a million made homeless .
water situation supplies of fresh water are reported to be sufficient at the moment , either from existing wells in the area or from supplies that are bussed in by the authorities .
the worst situation is in bhuj town itself , where many resident have resorted to washing themselves and their belongings in a lake in the town centre where hygiene levels are deteriorating .
the red cross is trying to set up a clean water facility at the lakeside and a large water filtration plant with excess capacity at the 350-bed hospital which it is trying to set up in bhuj .
large stockpiles of aid material are accumulating throughout the region , because not enough workers are available to distribute it .
the authorities say this situation will be remedied in the next couple of days .
dangerous work efforts to retrieve dead bodies and burnt them on the spot are continuing , but the dangerous nature of the work and the shortage of specialist equipment and resources is hampering progress .
sanjay gupta , a senior government official overseeing relief work in anjar said less than half of the town 's 7.5km of roads and by-lanes had been cleared so far .
aid workers have added their voices to survivors ' criticism that while international aid has been plentiful and quick to arrive , a lack of co-ordination has made it less effective than it could have been .
much of the relief effort has been co-ordinated by private and religious groups , not by government agencies .
