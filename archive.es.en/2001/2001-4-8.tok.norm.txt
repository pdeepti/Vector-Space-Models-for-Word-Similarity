the canadian minister for international trade , pierre pettigrew , said they agreed that the free trade area of the americas -lrb- ftaa -rrb- would come into effect by the end of that year .
i honestly believe that international trade negotiations will never be the same pierre pettigrew , canadian for international trade the bbc south america correspondent says the agreement represents an extremely ambitious free trade pact , aiming to cover the whole hemisphere - with the notable exception of cuba .
so far , however , it represents little more than a declaration of intent , and further negotiation over the small print of any final deal will be needed , our correspondent says .
the united states had been pushing for the pact to be agreed by the end of 2003 .
but brazil , supported by argentina and the other countries in the south american trading bloc mercosur , closed ranks to prevent that .
significant concession brazil has said it wants the ftaa to be an option , not destiny .
it wants to hold parallel talks with the european union , with whom it trades more than the united states .
i think what you 'll see over the months and years is a competition in trade liberalisation robert zoellick , us trade representative in a significant concession to labour , environmental and consumer groups who oppose the free trade area , the ministers agreed to publish the draft text from which they will negotiate a final agreement .
chile 's trade minister said the countries had also agreed to include labour and environmental standards , but not to link them to trade sanctions .
any agreements reached will also have to pass the test of a vote in national parliaments .
latin american countries want sharp reductions in us agricultural subsidies as a condition for a free trade pact - something which is expected to get a rough ride in the us congress .
us farmers oppose negotiations on domestic subsidies in the ftaa , because it would not require other developed countries like the european union and japan to make similar cuts .
scepticism brazil and other latin american countries also oppose us proposals that would require countries to pledge they would not relax their labour and environmental laws to attract investment .
many groups in brazil say that there should be a national referendum before the country commits itself to an americas free trade area .
the white house faces pressure from democrats to include labour and environmental provisions in trade pacts , but many developing countries fear they could become trade barriers .
officials are trying to hammer out guidelines for the ftaa , which would link more than 783 million people who produced more than $ 11,400bn in goods and services in 1999 , generating about $ 2,700bn in cross-border trade .
the talks took place against a backdrop of protests from from activists , who oppose the economic and social models that many american countries have adopted .
such systems of growth have , they say , worsened the plight of developing countries and widened the gap between the rich and the poor .

there has been criticism of the decision to stage an all-london tie at old trafford but efforts have been made to smooth the journeys of tottenham and arsenal fans .
the highways agency has agreed to suspend roadworks on the m6 and related motorways on the major routes from london to the north-west for the 1330 bst match .
the other game - between liverpool and wycombe wanderers - is being held in birmingham with kick-off at 1600 bst .
british airways has laid on a jumbo jet for the scheduled sunday morning heathrow to manchester service and added an extra flight .
different routes greater manchester police have advised fans of the two clubs to take differing routes to the stadium , with arsenal supporters requested to come off the m6 at junction 19 , while their spurs rivals should head for junction 21 .
everybody is working together to ensure that fans get to manchester as quickly and safely as possible fa spokesman charter trains for both clubs will depart from different stations in the capital and arrive at manchester 's two main stations , piccadilly and victoria .
the football association estimates that between them , the north london sides have chartered 100 coaches , five trains and four aircraft to cater for almost 9,000 of the 59,000 supporters who have bought tickets for the game .
the fa was originally criticised for holding the game at old trafford , particularly as the only virgin west coast mainline service from london to manchester was fully booked before the venue had even been announced .
cardiff chaos travel chaos blighted the worthington cup final at the millennium stadium in february , with many fans missing the start of the game and then taking hours to get home as traffic ground to a standstill on the motorways leading into cardiff .
but the fa says measures have been taken that will allow the games to pass off smoothly .
the association wants to ensure that the fans attending the first semi-final are clear of birmingham before supporters attending liverpool 's clash with wycombe at villa park start to head for home .
" everybody is working together to ensure that fans get to manchester as quickly and safely as possible , " said fa spokesman paul newman .
" the most important thing was that the maximum number of fans could get to see the game , which is why old trafford was selected .
" it was a decision taken not just by the fa but in conjunction with both clubs and the police , " he added .

the most explosive revelations come in the news of the world , whose reporters posed as an arab sheikh and his entourage to carry out the sting .
the row has extended to sophie 's business partner murray harkin while the now last week ran an intimate interview with sophie - given in exchange for the paper not publishing the transcript of the tapes - two other sunday papers published accounts of the countess 's " indiscretions " .
but now the now carries not only the transcripts of sophie 's remarks on senior royals and politicians but also of murray harkin - co-owner of her public relations firm rjh - allegedly confessing to the occasional use of illegal drugs .
the mail on sunday picks up this angle with the headline " sophie 's aide , gay sex and drugs " , and the mirror takes a similar stance with a front page screaming " sophie 's ecstasy and cocaine shock " .
ministers ' fury inside , the mirror quotes unnamed friends of mr harkin commenting on his " colourful life " and while buckingham palace has yet made no official response to sunday 's revelations , the paper says the queen is " in a state " about the affair .
and the mail alleges that the countess has launched another company called the british luxury council which has already had to apologise over suggestions that it is officially endorsed by the department of trade and industry .
the independent on sunday has a different take on mr harkin 's reported comment that he allegedly quite likes " the odd line of coke " .
the ios says ministers are furious with the disclosures because they could undermine the government 's latest anti-drugs strategy .
but according to the observer , it is buckingham palace which is angry with downing street .
senior royal aides accused ministers of deliberately " fanning the flames " of the affair in order to keep the story in the public agenda , the paper says .
this is so the government can use it to bring forward the issue of monarchy reform , the palace is said to believe .
career questioned the role of sophie as a career-woman and a member of the monarchy is examined by several papers .
the sunday express thinks the countess is " snubbing " the queen by planning to turn her pr firm into an " international empire " .
it says the palace has been pleading with her to stop working and become a " full-time royal wife " .
edward has defended his role as a working royal in the sunday times , however , it is prince edward who defends the couple 's role as working royalty .
touching on allegations that both he and his wife exploited their royal status in their business lives , the paper says that edward revealed his company was now making money after seven years of losses .
but the people thinks sophie 's relationship with prince edward is " in crisis " because of the scandal .
under the headline " ed & sophie 's sheiky marriage " it says edward is appalled by the row and the countess has spent " the last 48 hours in tears " .
