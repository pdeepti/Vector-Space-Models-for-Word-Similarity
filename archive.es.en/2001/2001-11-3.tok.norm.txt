bbc news -pipe- media reports -pipe- guide to the nicaraguan elections categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : monitoring : media reports front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 3 november , 2001 , 08:10 gmt guide to the nicaraguan elections a new-look daniel ortega hopes to win back power nicaraguans go to the polls on 4 november to choose between a former revolutionary and a businessman whose assets he confiscated , report bbc monitoring 's charlotte eimer and mike rose .
latest opinion polls predict a very close race for the presidency between the former revolutionary leader and president , daniel ortega , of the sandinista national liberation front -lrb- fsln -rrb- and the ruling liberal constitutionalist party 's -lrb- plc -rrb- candidate , enrique bolanos .
mr ortega , who introduced radical socialist policies when president during the 1980s , is campaigning on a theme of love and reconciliation .
mr bolanos , who was briefly imprisoned and had his assets seized when the fsln came to power in 1979 , was vice president until he resigned to run for the presidency .
turn out the elections for president and members of the national assembly may be overshadowed by a low turn out .
a recent report by the international republican institute criticized the electoral authorities for their " inability or lack of willingness to ensure the participation of all nicaraguans in the elections " .
voters population : 4.5 million electorate : 2.7 million universal suffrage at 16 the report said such failings " reduce the level of trust in the electoral process , which in itself already causes concern " .
business leaders fear a victory by mr ortega could lead to an outflow of capital and investment , while washington admits to " serious reservations " that a sandinista victory could change the strategic balance of power in central america , to the detriment of us trade and security interests .
corruption however , many nicaraguans criticize the 70-year old mr bolanos for failing to fight corruption in the current administration , led by president arnoldo aleman .
parties and presidential candidates liberal constitutionalist party -lrb- plc -rrb- : presidential candidate enrique bolanos ; vice-presidential candidate jose rizo sandinista national liberation front -lrb- fsln -rrb- : presidential candidate daniel ortega ; vice-presidential candidate agustin jarquine conservative party -lrb- pc -rrb- : presidential candidate alberto saborio ; vice-presidential candidate consuelo sequeira in the last general election , in 1996 , mr aleman decisively defeated mr ortega in the battle for the presidency by 51 % to 37 % .
however , he found it harder to overcome problems like unemployment , now estimated at over 50 per cent , corruption and an economic downturn .
there have also been acute food shortages in many parts of the country , caused by widespread crop failures in the wake of severe drought and flooding .
economic gloom commentators believe that the current economic climate will leave little room for manoeuvre whatever the election result .
the situation has been exacerbated by the us recession and the aftermath of the 11 september terrorist attacks .
among nicaragua 's women , many feel left out of the political process .
women 's leader marvis jiron complained : " we have no political power of our own " .
" we have no participation in the political arenas , the men are the decision-makers .
electoral law itself favours men , as they lead the political parties , " ms jiron says .
1996 elections liberal alliance , headed by the plc : 51 per cent fsln : 38 per cent .
nicaragua is a constitutional democracy with executive , legislative and judicial branches .
the national assembly comprises 93 deputies , 90 of them elected from departmental and national party lists , while three are held by the unsuccessful presidential candidates .
in total , 19 parties are currently represented in the national assembly , either independently or as part of an alliance .
according to nicaraguan law , political parties that do not win at least one seat automatically lose their legal status and must repay government campaign financing .

latest opinion polls predict a very close race for the presidency between the former revolutionary leader and president , daniel ortega , of the sandinista national liberation front -lrb- fsln -rrb- and the ruling liberal constitutionalist party 's -lrb- plc -rrb- candidate , enrique bolanos .
mr ortega , who introduced radical socialist policies when president during the 1980s , is campaigning on a theme of love and reconciliation .
mr bolanos , who was briefly imprisoned and had his assets seized when the fsln came to power in 1979 , was vice president until he resigned to run for the presidency .
turn out the elections for president and members of the national assembly may be overshadowed by a low turn out .
a recent report by the international republican institute criticized the electoral authorities for their " inability or lack of willingness to ensure the participation of all nicaraguans in the elections " .
voters population : 4.5 million electorate : 2.7 million universal suffrage at 16 the report said such failings " reduce the level of trust in the electoral process , which in itself already causes concern " .
business leaders fear a victory by mr ortega could lead to an outflow of capital and investment , while washington admits to " serious reservations " that a sandinista victory could change the strategic balance of power in central america , to the detriment of us trade and security interests .
corruption however , many nicaraguans criticize the 70-year old mr bolanos for failing to fight corruption in the current administration , led by president arnoldo aleman .
parties and presidential candidates liberal constitutionalist party -lrb- plc -rrb- : presidential candidate enrique bolanos ; vice-presidential candidate jose rizo sandinista national liberation front -lrb- fsln -rrb- : presidential candidate daniel ortega ; vice-presidential candidate agustin jarquine conservative party -lrb- pc -rrb- : presidential candidate alberto saborio ; vice-presidential candidate consuelo sequeira in the last general election , in 1996 , mr aleman decisively defeated mr ortega in the battle for the presidency by 51 % to 37 % .
however , he found it harder to overcome problems like unemployment , now estimated at over 50 per cent , corruption and an economic downturn .
there have also been acute food shortages in many parts of the country , caused by widespread crop failures in the wake of severe drought and flooding .
economic gloom commentators believe that the current economic climate will leave little room for manoeuvre whatever the election result .
the situation has been exacerbated by the us recession and the aftermath of the 11 september terrorist attacks .
among nicaragua 's women , many feel left out of the political process .
women 's leader marvis jiron complained : " we have no political power of our own " .
" we have no participation in the political arenas , the men are the decision-makers .
electoral law itself favours men , as they lead the political parties , " ms jiron says .
1996 elections liberal alliance , headed by the plc : 51 per cent fsln : 38 per cent .
nicaragua is a constitutional democracy with executive , legislative and judicial branches .
the national assembly comprises 93 deputies , 90 of them elected from departmental and national party lists , while three are held by the unsuccessful presidential candidates .
in total , 19 parties are currently represented in the national assembly , either independently or as part of an alliance .
according to nicaraguan law , political parties that do not win at least one seat automatically lose their legal status and must repay government campaign financing .
bbc monitoring , based in caversham in southern england , selects and translates information from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .
