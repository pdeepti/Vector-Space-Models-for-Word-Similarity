in a rallying call to snp activists ahead of this year 's expected general election , he will use friday 's address at hampden park to accuse labour of being tory leader william hague 's " big helpers " in scotland by continuing conservative party policy .
although a may election could now be in doubt because of the deepening foot-and-mouth crisis , the snp will still use this conference to rally supporters - emphasising the message that the snp stands for scotland .
independence will remain a key aim but there will also be a broader appeal , portraying the party as the champions of scotland at westminster .
john swinney : sets his sights on labour mr swinney is expected to attack labour - accusing the party of continuing the tory legacy in areas such as the millennium dome , trident , longer nhs waiting lists and a growing gap between rich and poor .
in a reference to a recent speech by first minister henry mcleish , in which he accused the liberal democrats of being william hague 's little helpers , mr swinney will say that in scotland , ' new labour ' are william hague 's " big helpers " .
mr swinney replaced alex salmond as leader of the party last year .
the latter left the position after a decade in charge .
the snp holds great electoral hopes for the forthcoming general election and believes it can dent labour 's stranglehold north of the border .
the party has long opposed the use of nuclear weapons and is expected to accuse labour of continuing the conservative party 's nuclear policies .
originally , the snp believed the spring conference would precede the general election by only a short period of time .
with the current foot-and-mouth epidemic sweeping the uk and local elections in england expected to be delayed , voters may not go to the polls for some time to come .

one in ten of all patients admitted to hospital is harmed by complications , half caused by medical mistakes of some kind .
the cost of the extra days in hospital needed is running to at least £ 1bn a year , said the research team from university college london .
medical mistakes : the consequences 53-year-old man admitted for leg ulcer treatment failure to do this properly led to bone damage , requiring double amputation below the knee in addition , incorrect management of urinary catheter left him with dying flesh on the end of his penis a second catheter site became infected he stayed an extra 26 days in hospital the survey , published in the british medical journal , is the first which confirms the high level of damaging mistakes in uk hospitals .
a leading doctor said that the profession was failing to " learn from its mistakes " .
the study looked at more than 1,000 medical and nursing records at two hospitals in london , then expanded these results to produce national predictions .
researchers found that almost 11 % of patients had suffered some sort of adverse event - some more than one .
in approximately 50 % , the researchers judged that hospital staff should have prevented them happening .
contributing to death a third of the events led to " moderate or greater impairment " - in 19 % of cases , the decline in their health as a result was permanent , and in 6 % , the adverse event contributed to death .
the figures contained in the report were first aired last year by the chief medical officer professor sir liam donaldson , but have now been published in full in the british medical journal .
professor sir george alberti , president of the royal college of physicians , wrote in an accompanying editorial that the " blame culture " in society put doctors and nurses off admitting mistakes .
he said : " if we are to learn from mistakes then we need to know about as many as possible so that corrective action can be taken .
" the main causes of adverse events relate to operative errors , drugs , medical procedures and diagnosis .
each of these is amenable to prevention . "
however , he also admitted that mistakes were inevitable because there were too few medical staff , who were forced to work too quickly to cope with intense demand .
it 's still the case that nobody knows exactly how many of these events are happening in uk hospitals each year marcus ward campaigner marcus ward , from the campaigning group action for victims of medical accidents said that the high numbers of adverse events revealed by the report was unsurprising .
he told bbc news online : " it 's still the case that nobody knows exactly how many of these events are happening in uk hospitals each year .
" this study only covered two hospitals , so their figure is only an estimate .
" the department of health should be funding the collection of more data . "
the issue of medical mistakes has been highlighted recently by cases in which wrongly administered drugs killed two patients , and a three-year-old girl died after being given nitrous oxide gas instead of oxygen .
the author of the report , professor charles vincent , said : " adverse events are a major source of harm to patients and a major drain on nhs resources .
" whether they are major events that are traumatic for staff and patients alike , or minor events that are frequent but go unnoticed in routine clinical care , together they have massive economic consequences for the provision of healthcare to use all . "

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- one in ten ' harmed in hospital ' low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's karen allen " researchers have found that one in ten suffer from what 's called ' an adverse event " ' real 56k mike stone , patients association " our reaction is one of shock but not complete surprise " real 56k professor george alberti " medical staff have to work too quickly " real 28k prof charles vincent , report 's author " it 's incorrect to say that huge numbers of people are dying . " real 56k friday , 2 march , 2001 , 08:07 gmt one in ten ' harmed in hospital ' some adverse events are avoidable almost 70,000 patients a year die partly as a result of " adverse events " they suffer during hospital stays , says a shocking report .
one in ten of all patients admitted to hospital is harmed by complications , half caused by medical mistakes of some kind .
the cost of the extra days in hospital needed is running to at least £ 1bn a year , said the research team from university college london .
medical mistakes : the consequences 53-year-old man admitted for leg ulcer treatment failure to do this properly led to bone damage , requiring double amputation below the knee in addition , incorrect management of urinary catheter left him with dying flesh on the end of his penis a second catheter site became infected he stayed an extra 26 days in hospital the survey , published in the british medical journal , is the first which confirms the high level of damaging mistakes in uk hospitals .
a leading doctor said that the profession was failing to " learn from its mistakes " .
the study looked at more than 1,000 medical and nursing records at two hospitals in london , then expanded these results to produce national predictions .
researchers found that almost 11 % of patients had suffered some sort of adverse event - some more than one .
in approximately 50 % , the researchers judged that hospital staff should have prevented them happening .
contributing to death a third of the events led to " moderate or greater impairment " - in 19 % of cases , the decline in their health as a result was permanent , and in 6 % , the adverse event contributed to death .
the figures contained in the report were first aired last year by the chief medical officer professor sir liam donaldson , but have now been published in full in the british medical journal .
professor sir george alberti , president of the royal college of physicians , wrote in an accompanying editorial that the " blame culture " in society put doctors and nurses off admitting mistakes .
he said : " if we are to learn from mistakes then we need to know about as many as possible so that corrective action can be taken .
" the main causes of adverse events relate to operative errors , drugs , medical procedures and diagnosis .
each of these is amenable to prevention . "
however , he also admitted that mistakes were inevitable because there were too few medical staff , who were forced to work too quickly to cope with intense demand .
it 's still the case that nobody knows exactly how many of these events are happening in uk hospitals each year marcus ward campaigner marcus ward , from the campaigning group action for victims of medical accidents said that the high numbers of adverse events revealed by the report was unsurprising .
he told bbc news online : " it 's still the case that nobody knows exactly how many of these events are happening in uk hospitals each year .
" this study only covered two hospitals , so their figure is only an estimate .
" the department of health should be funding the collection of more data . "
the issue of medical mistakes has been highlighted recently by cases in which wrongly administered drugs killed two patients , and a three-year-old girl died after being given nitrous oxide gas instead of oxygen .
the author of the report , professor charles vincent , said : " adverse events are a major source of harm to patients and a major drain on nhs resources .
" whether they are major events that are traumatic for staff and patients alike , or minor events that are frequent but go unnoticed in routine clinical care , together they have massive economic consequences for the provision of healthcare to use all . "
