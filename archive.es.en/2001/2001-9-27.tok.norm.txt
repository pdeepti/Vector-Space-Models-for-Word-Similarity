egypt is not expected to take an active role in any military action against afghanistan but it is thought the president will take an understanding approach to operations directed at osama bin laden .
president mubarak has warned against action that would hurt civilians but has made it clear that he regards the taleban as dangerous extremists .
on wednesday the foreign secretary had talks with egypt 's most senior cleric sheikh mohamed sayed tantawi and arab league secretary general amre moussa .
both men warned mr straw they would only support military action against the perpetrators of the us atrocities , but not innocent afghans .
targeting terrorists sharing a platform with mr straw after their meeting , mr moussa said : " any action that would result in a lot of innocent victims would indeed be a very sad result .
" in addition to thousands we lost as human beings in new york , we would be losing thousands in another place .
" we better not resort to any action that would result in this .
" but a surgical operation to deal with the accused after announcing the evidence on that , this would be something we would understand . "
mr mubarak is expected to be sympathetic he reiterated that arab countries would not take part in any planned us-led military action against afghanistan , although they were all " solidly against international terrorism " .
he suggested the best outcome would be for osama bin laden to be put on trial " for all of us around the world to know what exactly happened " .
a bbc correspondent says british officials saw this reaction as an endorsement of western plans to attack the taleban , while egyptian journalists saw it as a reprimand to britain for failing to extradite egyptians wanted by cairo on terrorist charges .
mr straw 's meeting in cairo with mr mubarak is the last engagement of his four-day tour of the region .
constructive talks mr straw had meetings in israel late on tuesday with israeli prime minister ariel sharon and mr peres .
the british minister described his talks with mr sharon as very constructive and cordial , saying they discussed the attacks on the us and agreed on the need for unanimity in fighting terrorism .
the meeting took place after britain and israel resolved a row over remarks by mr straw , which israel said implied that it was partly to blame for terrorist attacks against it .
mr straw also had talks with the palestinian legislator , hanan ashrawi , during which he stressed the need for the palestinian authority to do everything it could to ensure there was a complete halt to violence .
mr straw 's trip to israel follows a brief visit to tehran , where he consulted iranian leaders on the global crisis following the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .

the assistant chief constable for belfast , alan mcquillan , was speaking after loyalists threw petrol , blast and nail bombs at police lines on the crumlin road .
the police fired plastic bullets after they came under attack by a crowd of up to 300 , who also threw fireworks at ruc officers .
several police vehicles were struck by gunfire at cambrai street , and other vehicles were hi-jacked and set on fire , according to an ruc police spokesperson .
army technical officers made safe a pipe bomb-type device with nails attached which was lying on the crumlin road .
the trouble started on wednesday evening after loyalists blocked the crumlin road near the ardoyne shops to stage a protest .
mr mcquillan said a supposedly peaceful protest " rapidly degenerated into vicious attacks on police officers " .
he said officers had been preventing loyalists from reaching the brookfield mill complex , where a device exploded earlier in the day .
mr mcquillan said : " tonight police again find themselves in the middle while trying to prevent a concerted attack on the nationalist community .
" large numbers of police officers have had to be deployed and , because of the nature of the scale of the rioting , we have been forced to fire plastic baton rounds .
" i would appeal to all public representatives to do everything in their power to return some sort of sanity to this situation . "
unexploded mr mcquillan also criticised the " appalling scenes " earlier on wednesday when some loyalist protesters threw fireworks at parents going to collect children from the holy cross girls ' primary school in ardoyne .
it was the latest violence to flare in north belfast where tensions have been high , resulting in clashes between catholics and protestants .
no-one was injured in the earlier explosion at brookfield mill but two cars were damaged .
forensic tests were being carried out to try to establish which kind of device it was .
army bomb experts also defused three pipe bombs in a series of security alerts in the north of the city .
a device was found at the everton complex on the ardoyne road shortly before 0300 bst on wednesday .
on tuesday night , the army removed two unexploded pipe bombs from the back of a house in nearby rosapenna street .
senior police sources described violence of the past summer months as " the worst in the area in 20 years " .
a sinn fein representative in the area said the devices were thrown by loyalists from the oldpark road .
speaking on tuesday , the chief constable sir ronnie flanagan said it was too early to say which paramilitary groups had been behind the street violence in north belfast .
he was speaking after " ferocious " rioting , gun and bomb attacks in catholic-protestant interface areas in the north of the city on sunday and monday .
he said he had " no doubt " that members of the loyalist ulster defence association had been involved in the recent sectarian violence .
but he said it was a matter for northern ireland secretary john reid to decide whether there should be a declaration by him on the state of the uda ceasefire .
ulster unionist and democratic unionist politicians called on dr reid to review the ira ceasefire following three shooting attacks in the north of the city on monday .

ms jowell , who has been given special responsibility for co-ordinating the support for the british relatives of the victims of the attacks , also delivered personal letters of thanks from tony blair .
the prime minister had intended to meet firefighters and police during his visit to new york last week , but had to cancel that part of his visit to meet president george bush .
jowell : co-ordinating support to families about 200 british people are feared to have died in the terrorist atrocities , but ms jowell said it was still too soon to say exactly how many .
she said : " british families owe an enormous debt of gratitude to these firefighters , who lost 10 of their members when the twin towers collapsed .
" the prime minister wanted to come and thank them personally last week and i have brought a personal letter to the firefighters and the police from him .
" they need to know how grateful we are for what they have done to save the lives of british people in this unprecedented tragedy . "
firefighters gratitude ms jowell was introduced to firemen tom woods and captain mark munnelly , who met tony blair 's wife cherie when they visited the disaster scene last week .
capt munnelly said both visits had meant a lot to him and his men .
he said : " we know we are not isolated , but the whole world recognises what has happened and supports us .
words can not express the sorrow we feel at the loss of your firefighters , nor can we express in sufficient terms our admiration for your bravery tony blair " this letter from the prime minister shows us the world is grieving with us and we really appreciate it . "
mr blair 's letter was sent to fire battalion chief james wendling with a message of praise for the courage of his staff .
he said : " words can not express the sorrow we feel at the loss of your firefighters , nor can we express in sufficient terms our admiration for your bravery . "
he said they were an " inspiration to the world " , adding : " we stand with you in your sorrow " .
his letter to police chief kevin ward said the courage of the officers was " a beacon to the world " .
family suppport later , ms jowell visited the family centre set up by authorities in new york to deal with the relatives and friends of those missing and killed in the world trade centre attacks .
she said : " it is an extraordinarily impressive operation on a very large scale .
" the family centre itself is like a great hangar , an immense space that has been kitted out with facilities for families . "
and the minister said she was using her visit to review whether there were " gaps " in the help being offered to british families .
" whether or not the support is enough is something each family will judge , " she said .

ms jowell , who has been given special responsibility for co-ordinating the support for the british relatives of the victims of the attacks , also delivered personal letters of thanks from tony blair .
the prime minister had intended to meet firefighters and police during his visit to new york last week , but had to cancel that part of his visit to meet president george bush .
about 200 british people are feared to have died in the terrorist atrocities , but ms jowell said it was still too soon to say exactly how many .
she said : " british families owe an enormous debt of gratitude to these firefighters , who lost 10 of their members when the twin towers collapsed .
" the prime minister wanted to come and thank them personally last week and i have brought a personal letter to the firefighters and the police from him .
" they need to know how grateful we are for what they have done to save the lives of british people in this unprecedented tragedy . "
firefighters gratitude ms jowell was introduced to firemen tom woods and captain mark munnelly , who met tony blair 's wife cherie when they visited the disaster scene last week .
capt munnelly said both visits had meant a lot to him and his men .
he said : " we know we are not isolated , but the whole world recognises what has happened and supports us .
words can not express the sorrow we feel at the loss of your firefighters , nor can we express in sufficient terms our admiration for your bravery tony blair " this letter from the prime minister shows us the world is grieving with us and we really appreciate it . "
mr blair 's letter was sent to fire battalion chief james wendling with a message of praise for the courage of his staff .
he said : " words can not express the sorrow we feel at the loss of your firefighters , nor can we express in sufficient terms our admiration for your bravery . "
he said they were an " inspiration to the world " , adding : " we stand with you in your sorrow " .
his letter to police chief kevin ward said the courage of the officers was " a beacon to the world " .
family suppport later , ms jowell visited the family centre set up by authorities in new york to deal with the relatives and friends of those missing and killed in the world trade centre attacks .
she said : " it is an extraordinarily impressive operation on a very large scale .
" the family centre itself is like a great hangar , an immense space that has been kitted out with facilities for families . "
and the minister said she was using her visit to review whether there were " gaps " in the help being offered to british families .
" whether or not the support is enough is something each family will judge , " she said .
" we have put in place a whole range of measures .
the major organisation concerned with supporting families facing bereavement have come together to help .
" one of my reasons for being here is to make sure that if there are gaps then we take action to fill them . "

the turbine will provide power for a distribution depot operated by the sainsbury 's supermarket company in east kilbride .
uk minister for energy and industry brian wilson and scottish executive environment minister rhona brankin will officially launch the project .
the project , called merchant wind power , has been put together by gloucestershire-based firm ecotricity .

" it is a pioneering initiative that leads to the supply of ' green ' energy which costs less than conventional electricity in the long run . "

the draft also seeks to improve the extradition of suspects and advance the exchange of information .
political measures , economic measures , intelligence measures , financial measures are extremely important to cut the financing of international terrorists italian foreign minister renato ruggiero all four representatives - from russia , china , france and britain - are reported to have given their backing to the resolution .
it is to be put before the whole security council late on thursday , and diplomats say it should be adopted before the un general assembly begins a debate on counter-terrorist measures .
the bbc 's un correspondent , greg barrow , says the us move is an attempt to fast-track the measures , which are likely to get bogged down by procedure and arguments over definition .
self-defence he adds that the security council has already done enough to give the us the go-ahead for a retaliatory strike .
on 12 september it condemned what it called " the horrifying terrorist attacks " , and went on to say that the security council " regards such acts , like any act of international terrorism , as a threat to international peace and security " .
this wording appears to support the us right to respond in self-defence against the suspected perpetrators .
long-term strategy but work still needs to be done on a long-term strategy to deal with international terrorism .
italian foreign minister renato ruggiero said military action was not the only solution .
" we need to have many other measures which will have at least equal importance , " he said .

the bush administration has already begun taking such steps by freezing the assets of 27 individuals and organisations - some of them suspected of being fronts for islamic extremist activities .
