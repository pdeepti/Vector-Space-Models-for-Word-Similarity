" east berlin " , " west berlin " , " divided city " , " berlin after the fall of the wall " , " unified berlin " - as the city lurched from one turbulent phase to the other , the adjectives describing it have varied .
new names have alwas been coined to refer to this city that has undergone so many fundamental and at times radical transformations till date .
since the fall of the wall in 1989 , the city has been caught up in a frenetic pace of change .
new buildings and complexes are transforming street and landscapes .
berlin defies all definition and keeps reinventing itself .
but all future projects here seem doomed to be caught up in the complex accumulations of history .
any new structure in the city is incomplete without photographs and information of the " before " and " after " .
past and present are visible in berlin as if seen through a magnifying glass .
anyone who understands the language of historic buildings , can not help being moved or feeling a shudder when walking through this city .
today this significant and troubled city of the western world has another new name - " the new berlin " .
it 's an outcome largely of the building and real estate boom in the city after the fall of the wall in 1989 , and the german federal government 's decision to move its headquarters back to berlin . dw-world.de dw-world : a short tour of berlin dw-world : berlin - the resurrected capital picture of the day dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaftsbilanz we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

journalist martin bashir has interviewed mr barrymore , who was recently cautioned by police on drug offences .
stuart lubbock , 31 , died at mr barrymore 's essex home in march this year , after a party .
the entertainer said he felt remorse and responsibility .
" i ca n't imagine how stuart lubbock 's family are feeling ...
i 'm sorry for them , i 'm terribly sorry , i 'm sorry for stuart , he did n't deserve to die , " mr barrymore said .
this was somebody i never knew but it was my house , it was my pool and i felt responsible for that michael barrymore " i do feel responsible , i 'm responsible for the house ...
i 'm not responsible for his demise . "
mr barrymore , who is undergoing treatment for alcoholism and drug addiction , explained how he panicked and fled from his home when he realised what had happened .
" this was somebody i never knew but it was my house , it was my pool and i felt responsible for that .
i did n't know how it happened or what happened , to this day i do n't know what happened to him . "

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- israel considers further withdrawal categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : middle east front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 30 october , 2001 , 05:35 gmt israel considers further withdrawal the latest violence has caused widespread destruction the israeli defence minister has said his forces will pull out of four more west bank towns if the palestinians guarantee security there .
binyamin ben eliezer was speaking after israeli troops completed a withdrawal from palestinian-ruled bethlehem and nearby beit jala .
the united states welcomed the israeli move , but urged israel to pull out of the other palestinian-controlled areas in the west bank .
a report by a un human rights investigator says that israel and the palestinian authority should agree on the deployment of international monitors or peacekeepers to oversee any ceasefire agreement .
the bbc 's united nations correspondent says the new report labels israel as an occupying power in palestinian areas , and accuses the israeli army of using excessive force against palestinian protesters and gunmen .
the report 's author , un human rights investigator john dugard , says he finds it difficult to understand why the international community does not put more pressure on israel to accept international monitors or peacekeepers .
following the weekend 's violence , parts of bethlehem were left looking like a war zone , with several houses close to manger square destroyed .
shop fronts were demolished and buildings scarred by bullets and tank fire .
the israeli withdrawal came despite two shooting attacks by palestinian militants on sunday that killed five people in northern israel .
more funerals have hardened positions on both sides the israelis said the pull-out was a test case for withdrawals from four other towns they entered 10 days ago - jenin , qalqilya , ramallah and tulkarm .
further withdrawals could proceed " the moment anyone gets up on the palestinian side and says they take responsibility for security , " mr ben eliezer said .
palestinian casualties the palestinian mayor of bethlehem , hanna nasser , said the israeli operation had left a legacy of hatred , and cost the palestinians about $ 18m in lost revenue .
the withdrawal from bethlehem and beit jala is encouraging .
we look to israel to complete the process of withdrawal from all the other palestinian-controlled areas us state department spokesman richard boucher other palestinian officials said at least 20 palestinians had been killed during the incursion .
israel moved forces into and around the six palestinian-run towns and cities in the west bank on 17 october in response to the assassination of israeli tourism minister rehavam zeevi .
at least 40 palestinians have died in clashes since then .
us pressure the united states , which has been trying to calm a year of israeli-palestinian violence as it pursues its military campaign in afghanistan , is pressuring israel 's prime minister ariel sharon to withdraw from the remaining towns quickly .
" we want to see it go through immediately , we are encouraging them to continue this process and see it go through all the way , " said us state department spokesman richard boucher .
israeli foreign policy adviser danny analon has told the bbc that mr sharon 's visit to the united states planned for early november " is on schedule " .
if mr sharon 's visit takes place while israeli forces are still occupying palestinian towns he can expect a hostile reception , the bbc 's middle east analyst roger hardy says .
the israeli military offensive has led to unusually strong condemnation from senior us officials and has strained us-israeli relations .
sunday attack sunday saw two palestinian gunmen kill four women and wound up to 14 others in the coastal city of hadera , north of tel aviv , hours after an israeli soldier was shot dead in the same area .
the militant palestinian group islamic jihad said in a videotaped statement that its men - who fired at random from a car before being shot dead by police - carried out the attack .

at the centre of the proceedings , the protagonist - former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic - has not changed his attitude since his first court appearance in july .
there is no longer an element of surprise when mr milosevic tries to turn the legal proceedings into a show trial it was then that he uttered his famous phrase - " that 's your problem " - after the judge asked him whether he wanted the indictment against him read out .
interest in the milosevic case has not waned .
public and press galleries are still packed and the media , cameras and satellite trucks are still parked outside the court when the former president makes an appearance .
but what has changed is the atmosphere inside the court room .
there is no longer an element of surprise when mr milosevic tries to turn the legal proceedings into a show trial .
those on both sides of the bullet-proof glass separating observers from those in the legal world have come to expect his sporadic , feisty outbursts .
interesting start tribunal representatives had been bracing themselves for another show of defiance at mr milosevic 's third court appearance , on monday .
mr milosevic entered the court with his usual nonchalance .
he listened intently as the hearing got off to an interesting start .
the amici curiae , or " friends of the court " - the three independent lawyers appointed by the court to assist him with his case in the interests of a fair trial - presented a challenging argument to the judges .
they proposed that , in responding to mr milosevic 's claim that the tribunal is biased against him , the court itself should not rule on its own competence .
instead they advised the judges to seek the expert opinion of the world court on this matter .
one of the amici curiae , stephen kay qc , said the un 's highest legal organ - the international court of justice , also in the hague , is the only body equipped to put the legitimacy of the tribunal to the test .
he said : " one of the key fundamental principles for any valid court of law is the principle of impartiality .
without that , there can be no rule of law and no right to a fair trial , so this court should be validated by the principle organ of the un " .
more evidence the showdown came later during proceedings .
since his arrival at the hague three months ago , mr milosevic has refused to read the indictment against him - or have it read to him - a mandatory requirement of the court .
at monday 's hearing , the former president had to sit through a lengthy reading of the amended kosovo indictment and a new indictment covering war crimes in croatia .
the extra charges in the kosovo indictment take into account the discovery of a mass grave in a belgrade suburb , believed to contain the bodies of kosovar albanian victims .
both indictments charge mr milosevic with murder , persecution and deportation , and accuse him of the ethnic cleansing of kosovar albanians , croats and other non-serbs , in his bid to build a greater serbia during the 1990s .
mr milosevic again refused to plead to the charges in the two indictments .
he tried to interrupt judge richard may as he entered a plea of not guilty on mr milosevic 's behalf .
lack of clarity the issues raised in the milosevic case are complex , legal ones .
there is the question of his immunity as a former head of state , as well as the legality of his transfer to the hague by serb authorities last june .
but mr milosevic 's non-participation in the proceedings - such as refusing to listen through a headset to a translation of the prosecutor 's response in the french language , which he does not understand - obviously does not leave much room for clarity in his case .
when the judge did allow him to speak earlier in the proceedings , he stated in calm clear tones that the kosovo indictment against him was false .
he said that during the conflict he had only been defending his nation and protecting the yugoslav people from what he called terrorism .
mr milosevic sees himself as the victim of what he ironically terms " hague fair play " .
the judges and the amici curiae are on the same side , he says .
and it is they who will be pulling the strings at the status conference on the milosevic case , on tuesday .

at the centre of the proceedings , the protagonist - former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic - has not changed his attitude since his first court appearance in july .
there is no longer an element of surprise when mr milosevic tries to turn the legal proceedings into a show trial it was then that he uttered his famous phrase - " that 's your problem " - after the judge asked him whether he wanted the indictment against him read out .
interest in the milosevic case has not waned .
public and press galleries are still packed and the media , cameras and satellite trucks are still parked outside the court when the former president makes an appearance .
but what has changed is the atmosphere inside the court room .
there is no longer an element of surprise when mr milosevic tries to turn the legal proceedings into a show trial .
those on both sides of the bullet-proof glass separating observers from those in the legal world have come to expect his sporadic , feisty outbursts .
interesting start tribunal representatives had been bracing themselves for another show of defiance at mr milosevic 's third court appearance , on monday .
new kosovo charges have been brought mr milosevic entered the court with his usual nonchalance .
he listened intently as the hearing got off to an interesting start .
the amici curiae , or " friends of the court " - the three independent lawyers appointed by the court to assist him with his case in the interests of a fair trial - presented a challenging argument to the judges .
they proposed that , in responding to mr milosevic 's claim that the tribunal is biased against him , the court itself should not rule on its own competence .
instead they advised the judges to seek the expert opinion of the world court on this matter .
one of the amici curiae , stephen kay qc , said the un 's highest legal organ - the international court of justice , also in the hague , is the only body equipped to put the legitimacy of the tribunal to the test .
he said : " one of the key fundamental principles for any valid court of law is the principle of impartiality .
without that , there can be no rule of law and no right to a fair trial , so this court should be validated by the principle organ of the un " .
more evidence the showdown came later during proceedings .
since his arrival at the hague three months ago , mr milosevic has refused to read the indictment against him - or have it read to him - a mandatory requirement of the court .
milosevic could face a another indictment on bosnia at monday 's hearing , the former president had to sit through a lengthy reading of the amended kosovo indictment and a new indictment covering war crimes in croatia .
the extra charges in the kosovo indictment take into account the discovery of a mass grave in a belgrade suburb , believed to contain the bodies of kosovar albanian victims .
both indictments charge mr milosevic with murder , persecution and deportation , and accuse him of the ethnic cleansing of kosovar albanians , croats and other non-serbs , in his bid to build a greater serbia during the 1990s .
mr milosevic again refused to plead to the charges in the two indictments .
he tried to interrupt judge richard may as he entered a plea of not guilty on mr milosevic 's behalf .
lack of clarity the issues raised in the milosevic case are complex , legal ones .
there is the question of his immunity as a former head of state , as well as the legality of his transfer to the hague by serb authorities last june .
but mr milosevic 's non-participation in the proceedings - such as refusing to listen through a headset to a translation of the prosecutor 's response in the french language , which he does not understand - obviously does not leave much room for clarity in his case .
when the judge did allow him to speak earlier in the proceedings , he stated in calm clear tones that the kosovo indictment against him was false .
he said that during the conflict he had only been defending his nation and protecting the yugoslav people from what he called terrorism .
mr milosevic sees himself as the victim of what he ironically terms " hague fair play " .
the judges and the amici curiae are on the same side , he says .
and it is they who will be pulling the strings at the status conference on the milosevic case , on tuesday .

so far the environment agency has said people have nothing to worry about this year with river levels remaining normal .
despite the government allocating an extra £ 51m for flood defences , those on the ground say they see little sign of anything being done .
installing flood defences takes time , so shrewsbury and bewdley will have to survive another winter before their dramatic portable flood barriers can be put in place .
meanwhile , in smaller towns such as upton-on-severn it will probably be uneconomic to install expensive flood barriers .
so those living along the river severn are facing up to the hard facts that they will have to spend another winter without defences and some places may never be defended to the level they would like .
but bewdley in particular has shown the way forward for those living by a river .
for while the authorities have been unable to show much concrete action these past months , the residents of bewdley have been preparing for the worst .
flood fairs once the water had receded last year the people of bewdley formed a flood defence committee .
for the first time , those directly affected by flooding in the town had an organised voice .
so while flood defences for bewdley will not be ready this winter , they have been pushed through ahead of schedule partly thanks to the committee .
the committee also organised one of britain 's first flood fairs .
flood prevention products for the home were put on display by the manufacturers .
it proved a popular event with more than 500 people from outside the town attending .
since then the committee has helped others to organise flood fairs , with five having been held so far .
the committee can also help with those annoying niggles that the authorities tend to overlook .
for example bewdley 's flood defence committee has made sure the local council promises to clean up and remove sandbags this year once the waters recede .
soaking , split bags were a real problem in the town last year .
worst in 30 years the people in bewdley have spent the last 12 months learning once again how to cope with flooding and installing their own barriers and even pumps under the floor .
though they hope they will not be reliving the events of a year ago .
and if you wonder why people who live by the river severn seemed so surprised to be flooded in the first place it is due to a fluke .
examining the records kept of the maximum river height in bewdley , we found that for the last 30 years the river has never been high enough to flood buildings in the town .
until the year 2000 , of course .
it seems because of this unlikely dry period the people simply forgot how to cope with the river severn when it turned against them .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- european press review categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : europe front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 30 october , 2001 , 07:06 gmt european press review a french paper reporting from the opposition front in afghanistan says the us strikes have not proved very helpful to the anti-taleban fighters .
the french government comes in for more criticism over its latest decision on corsican nationalist prisoners .
the 40th anniversary of turkish guest workers in germany is marked in the german press .
and a danish paper welcomes the reclassification of cannabis in britain , but warns against doing the same for ecstasy not so quiet on northern front le figaro in paris devotes its lead story to a report from its special correspondent with the anti-taleban northern alliance forces in north-eastern afghanistan .
the correspondent says that for the first time american planes have targeted the taleban forces on the other side of the front in this part of the country .
but he adds that the local northern alliance leader , gen alim jonali , is not impressed by the results , which the general says were off target and landed in the no-man 's-land between the two sides " they do n't even risk hurting a goat where they have struck , " gen jonali is quoted as saying of the us strikes .
" if they do n't coordinate with us it wo n't produce anything , " he adds .
mind your language berlin 's die tageszeitung is highly critical of german chancellor gerhard schroeder for saying the bombing campaign against afghanistan should not be halted during the muslim holy month of ramadan .
the paper considers schroeder 's statement , made during his visit to pakistan , to be " over hasty , disproportionate and politically extremely unwise " .
the paper says this will be seen throughout the islamic world as a provocation .
" after all , " it says , " one can not be against the war of cultures and religions and at the same time offend the religious feelings of nations , no matter how unintentionally . "
paris " hesitating " on corsica le monde in paris says in an editorial that french prime minister lionel jospin has made the right choice by trying to reach a political agreement on the future of corsica .
it welcomes the announcement that a special detention centre is to be built to house corsican nationalist prisoners together on the island , even if the opposition and other political groups have come out against it .
" grouping the prisoners together on the island , " the paper says , " is a legitimate concession and in line with the laws of the republic . "
" however , it should have been negotiated in exchange for a very clear gesture by the nationalists . "
the paper adds that instead the government " is hesitating ... and , as a result , is opening the way for its opponents ' disparate coalition " .
ecstasy : a trip too far copenhagen 's information approves of cannabis being reclassified in the uk but says the time is not yet right to do the same with ecstasy .
a leader entitled " cannabis legalis " ponders why the otherwise authority-obsessed uk government seems to have changed direction on cannabis .
but the paper warns that reclassifying ecstasy will be " a harder nut to crack " .
" the british public is well aware that dozens of young people have died from ecstasy since the drug came to britain in the 1980s .
" on the other hand , cannabis has history and experience on its side .
reclassification is fine .
but the time is hardly right to do something similar with a drug like ecstasy , " information concludes .
new trial unlikely despite a confession appearing in a tabloid newspaper , sweden 's sydsvenska dagbladet sees little chance of a new trial over the murder of swedish prime minister olof palme in 1986 .
christer pettersson , who stood trial for the murder , was acquitted , but has spoken of his guilt in the newspaper confession .
" something exceptional " will be required for the high court to order a new trial , the paper says .
" a confession by proxy is hardly sufficient .
the police have to have a significantly more accurate and credible account of what happened on the night of the murder , and preferably information about the weapon which was never found , " it concludes .
mixed results of turkish guests germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung says that today is the 40th anniversary of the agreement to officially invite turkish workers into germany .
although , it says , " ' guest workers ' became immigrants and , finally , holders of dual citizenship " , the process has been far from perfect .
it says that the many successful cases of integration are offset by just as many unsuccessful ones .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .
