islanders on gigha have already met local politicians to discuss how to raise the £ 3.8m asking price .
the present owner , 74-year-old derek holt , said ill health had forced him to put the island up for sale .
the island , which lies more than 20 miles from the mull of kintyre , has a population of 110 .
the community is now bidding to become its own landlord .
community representatives will meet highlands and islands enterprise next week to discuss the buy-out .
the argyll and bute msp george lyon has already called on the scottish executive to provide funds to help the islanders raise the £ 3.8m asking price .
the lib dem msp said the island 's situation illustrated a classic example of a community being bought and sold without their consent .
mr holt has said he would consider a bid from local residents .
absentee landlord but the selling agents , fpd savills , have reported that the island is already generating interest - with at least one prospective buyer understood to be an american .
the liberal democrat mp for argyll and bute , alan reid , said the scottish executive should take action to ensure the island does not fall into the hands of an absentee landlord .
he said it should provide money to help finance a purchase or take action through land reform .
the 3,400-acre island contains 37 cottages , a shop and a pub , as well as a nine-hole golf course and private airstrip .
i believe the community wants to buy the island and i want to help them do that .
argyll and bute msp george lyon mr lyon said : " this is a classic example where an island community has been bought and sold over the past 30 years and never has anyone given them the chance to purchase the island and take control of their own destiny .
" i believe the community wants to buy the island and i want to help them do that .
" the thought of communities being bought and sold as some millionaire 's play thing is abhorrent . "

islanders on gigha have already met local politicians to discuss how to raise the £ 3.8m asking price .

the island , which lies more than 20 miles from the mull of kintyre , has a population of 110 .
the island extends to more than 3,000 acres the community is now bidding to become its own landlord .
community representatives will meet highlands and islands enterprise next week to discuss the buy-out .
the argyll and bute msp george lyon has already called on the scottish executive to provide funds to help the islanders raise the £ 3.8m asking price .
the lib dem msp said the island 's situation illustrated a classic example of a community being bought and sold without their consent .
mr holt has said he would consider a bid from local residents .
absentee landlord but the selling agents , fpd savills , have reported that the island is already generating interest - with at least one prospective buyer understood to be an american .
the liberal democrat mp for argyll and bute , alan reid , said the scottish executive should take action to ensure the island does not fall into the hands of an absentee landlord .
he said it should provide money to help finance a purchase or take action through land reform .
the 3,400-acre island contains 37 cottages , a shop and a pub , as well as a nine-hole golf course and private airstrip .
i believe the community wants to buy the island and i want to help them do that .
argyll and bute msp george lyon mr lyon said : " this is a classic example where an island community has been bought and sold over the past 30 years and never has anyone given them the chance to purchase the island and take control of their own destiny .
" i believe the community wants to buy the island and i want to help them do that .
" the thought of communities being bought and sold as some millionaire 's play thing is abhorrent . "

a former intelligence agent has told the bbc that the ombudsman nuala o 'loan has a transcript of a tape which proves the police were given information .
the chief constable sir ronnie flanagan described as " preposterous " allegations that the ruc had prior knowledge of the 1998 bombing which killed 29 people .
mrs o 'loan 's investigation was launched after the agent claimed in newspaper interviews that he had tipped off the ruc about plans by dissident republicans to plant a huge bomb somewhere in northern ireland .
the man , using the cover name kevin fulton , said he gave information to his police handler two days before the omagh bomb .
' preposterous ' speaking on the bbc on friday , sir ronnie said the security forces were aware of the threat of the real ira , but had no specific information about the bombing in omagh .
" we had information and we had a belief that the real ira were very active , " he said .
" the suggestion that we had any information , which if acted upon could have prevented omagh , is an absolutely preposterous suggestion .
there is no substance in it . "
willy carlin , who acts as a spokesman for a group of former intelligence agents , claimed the authorities were trying to mount a cover-up .
in an interview with the bbc , he said the police ombudsman had been given a tape recording of a conversation between kevin fulton and his ruc handler .
the secretary of state , dr john reid , said any such tape should be investigated by the ombudsman .
senior police sources confirmed that kevin fulton had worked for the ruc as an intelligence agent , but they strenuously denied any suggestion that they had been given prior warning about the omagh bomb .
on friday , mrs o 'loan said the investigation was " highly sensitive " .
" the relatives of the omagh victims , the secretary of state , the chief constable and the police authority have all stated their support for my decision , and my focus now is on carrying out the investigation as quickly and as rigorously as possible , " she said .
the investigation comes two days after the third anniversary of the atrocity in county tyrone on 15 august 1998 .
civil action imran khan , the lawyer representing the man at the centre of the allegations , said it was important the ombudsman examined the claims .
" clearly the allegation is very serious and there is a real responsibility on the ombudsman , particularly to the families who have suffered as a result of omagh , that this allegation is checked and double checked and investigated thoroughly and quickly . "
victims ' relatives formally launched a civil action against five men with alleged links to the paramilitary group , claiming it was " their last hope for justice " .
michael gallagher , who lost his son aidan in the bombing , also welcomed the move and said he hoped the inquiry would move swiftly .
