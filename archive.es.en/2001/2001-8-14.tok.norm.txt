the average american ate 3 % fewer meals out last year than in 1999 , the biggest drop since 1979 , according to market research firm npd group .
for the year ended february 2001 , the average american ate 137 meals out , down from 141 the year before .
" we 've never seen this kind of drop , " said npd president harry balzer said .
" the economy certainly did n't help and the price of food bought at a restaurant is n't helping - it 's rising faster than the food cost anywhere else . "
the average restaurant meal price was $ 4.92 per person in 2000 , up about 4 % from $ 4.72 a year before .
recession fears the figures - albeit not hugely insignificant in themselves - are one more piece of evidence that the us economy is slowing sharply .
indicators of household spending are especially important , since the bubbly consumer market was seen as a key counterweight to the depression suffered by manufacturing industry in the us and elsewhere .
the us is due to release keenly awaited figures on retail sales at 1330 gmt on tuesday .
but the restaurant figure is not necessarily an unequivocal indication of slowdown .
mr balzer also attributed the cutback to the use of meal solutions , or prepared dishes that need very little cooking or clean-up and are cheaper than take-out meals .
" we will not let our food budget rise faster than our incomes and restaurant food by its very nature is going to be more expensive than making it at home , " mr balzer said .

after a majority vote , the boj is trying to put more money into circulation to allow hard-pressed banks to lend more .
other countries might use a cut in interest rates to encourage lending .
but japan 's short-term interest rates are already at zero , after an aggressive loosening of policy in march .
instead , the boj is raising its target for current-account deposits at the central bank to 6 trillion yen -lrb- £ 34bn ; $ 49bn -rrb- from 5 trillion yen .
the bank also said it will boost its monthly purchases of long-term japanese government bonds to 600bn yen from the previous 400bn yen .
gdp fears the decision comes three weeks before the unveiling of japan 's latest gross domestic product figures , which are widely expected to show the health of the economy is , if anything , getting worse .
many observers expected the bank to make its move after the figures , according to fiachra mccanna , head of research at westlb .
" the timing more than the level of it was a surprise , " he told the bbc 's world business report .
" they moved for two reasons - because they expect the numbers to be really horrible , and because if they did n't move beforehand , the politicians will blame them for the turn in the economy . "
cosmetic decision he doubted whether the move will have much practical effect , though .
" i do n't think that the boj itself really believes it will boost the economy , " said mr mccanna .
" they 've often said that under the current circumstances monetary policy can only play a limited role .
with the huge amount of bad debt they have in the system , banks are simply unwilling - or unable - to lend money to corporations and so it really makes no difference how much liquidity you pump into the economy . "
vincent musumeci , an economist at abn amro , was harsher , saying that the decision was entirely cosmetic .
" they had to show some easing effort and this is their reaction to pressure , " he said .
" it does n't change the fact that monetary policy is ineffective .
it does n't make any difference since rates are at zero . "
japan 's politicians have put enormous pressure on the boj to help stimulate the economy , but after many rounds of policy loosening , each fresh change has less dramatic effect .
some argue that the ball is now in the politicians ' court .
" they really do have no other option at this point ... we just have to hope and pray that the politicians implement the reform ... nothing would be worse than to flood the economy with money and then the politicians not do anything else , then we would really be in a pickle , " kenneth courtis , vice chairman of goldman sachs asia , told the world business report .
market cheer still , the move comes at a crucial time for the japanese economy and financial markets .
japanese shares fell by more than 2 % on monday , to their lowest level since 1984 .
revised figures released by the ministry of economy , trade and industry on tuesday showed that industrial output in june was down 8.7 % year on year , compared with an annual slowing of only 3.9 % in may .
the yen reacted quickly to the monetary-policy news , sliding from 122.38 to 123.14 in the us dollar in the minutes after the announcement .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- wimpey buys mcalpine building unit categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 14 august , 2001 , 06:06 gmt 07:06 uk wimpey buys mcalpine building unit wimpey 's move could trigger wider consolidation property firm alfred mcalpine said it had agreed to sell its house-building business to rival george wimpey .
the price tag was £ 461m in cash , mcalpine said - slightly higher than the £ 440m indicated by speculation ahead of the deal .
the deal creates the uk 's largest house building group with a value of more than £ 1bn .
uk house builders -lrb- by market capitalisation -rrb- berkeley group : £ 929.5m persimmon : £ 898m barratt development : £ 802.5m george wimpey : £ 724.9m wilson bowden : £ 688.5m bellway : £ 395.5m mcalpine : £ 357.8m wimpey said that it expected to cut about 450 jobs from the unit , as it merges it into its own operations .
bigger players the move could trigger a much wider shakeup of the uk house building industry , which analysts say is dominated by medium-sized firms .
plans for new house building in the uk are well behind schedule , and house prices continue to soar in many parts of the country as new housing starts have fallen .
part of the problem , according to some , is the range of small-to-medium building firms lacking the " assembly line " ethos and techniques which bring prices down in the us and much of europe .
but in the meantime , prospects for the housing business have improved further , thanks to the recent surprise cut in uk interest rates .
mcalpine also announced that it plans to return more than £ 100m to shareholders during 2002 .
alfred mcalpine said it will retain assets worth £ 34m from its house-building unit . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's quentin sommerville " the latest deal takes wimpey into a more upmarket neighbourhood " see also : 02 aug 01 -pipe- business mcalpine in buyout talks with wimpey 01 aug 01 -pipe- business when will house prices start to fall ? 17 aug 01 -pipe- business house giants come under same roof 12 jun 00 -pipe- uk politics showdown looms over new houses internet links : mcalpine george wimpey the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : worldcom chiefs refuse to testify buoyant ebay snaps up bills firm digital tv woes hit pace profits bush vows action after scandals merck ' exaggerated ' revenue in accounts congress pushes accounting reform oil trade thaws us-russian ties hiv : the drug firms ' quest for a cure links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

mr vedrine is on the third stop on a four-nation tour of the great lakes region of central africa .
earlier he held talks in the rwandan capital , kigali , with president paul kagame .
france wishes to be with modern rwanda during its reconstruction , to clear away the horrors of the past hubert vedrine rwanda supports an armed insurgency against government forces in the democratic republic of congo .
the bbc correspondent in kigali says mr vedrine acknowledged rwanda 's concerns over its border security and urged neighbouring countries and other protagonists in the lusaka peace accord to help resolve the problem .
it was the first time since 1978 that a french foreign minister had made an official visit to rwanda .
the 1994 genocide strained french-rwandan ties mr vedrine 's visit was also billed as an attempt to normalise bilateral relations with rwanda after the 1994 genocide .
france gave critical backing to the former rwandan regime of the late juvenal habyarimana , whose assassination sparked the genocide , before and during the bloodbath .
france has been accused of helping those suspected of atrocities to escape the country under an initiative - ostensibly humanitarian - known as operation turquoise .
at least 800,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the space of 100 days in 1994 .
most of the dead were tutsis and those who perpetrated the violence , mainly hutu .

mr vedrine is also due to visit kinshasa for talks with the dr congo president , joseph kabila .
president kagame , in a newspaper interview earlier this year , said he had not seen any significant change in france 's relations with rwanda , although the rwandan embassy in paris is due to reopen next year .
the democratic republic of congo is another point of contention in franco-rwandan relations .
france has been active within the united nations at security council level in putting pressure on rwanda to pull out of dr congo completely .

disarming hutus meanwhile on monday , the british government announced it would finance a scheme aimed at disarming hutu rebels blamed for the genocide .
the announcement was made by the british international development secretary , clare short , after she concluded a tour of the region .
the scheme , costing $ 7m , will target hutu militias in the dr congo .
ms short said the money would go to women who could persuade their men to give up their weapons and return home .
she said disarming hutu fighters would also reduce concerns by rwanda and uganda over their own security , encouraging them to end their involvement in the fighting in the dr congo .

mr vedrine is on the third stop on a four-nation tour of the great lakes region of central africa .
earlier he held talks in the rwandan capital , kigali , with president paul kagame .
france wishes to be with modern rwanda during its reconstruction , to clear away the horrors of the past hubert vedrine rwanda supports an armed insurgency against government forces in the democratic republic of congo .
the bbc correspondent in kigali says mr vedrine acknowledged rwanda 's concerns over its border security and urged neighbouring countries and other protagonists in the lusaka peace accord to help resolve the problem .
it was the first time since 1978 that a french foreign minister had made an official visit to rwanda .
mr vedrine 's visit was also billed as an attempt to normalise bilateral relations with rwanda after the 1994 genocide .
france gave critical backing to the former rwandan regime of the late juvenal habyarimana , whose assassination sparked the genocide , before and during the bloodbath .
france has been accused of helping those suspected of atrocities to escape the country under an initiative - ostensibly humanitarian - known as operation turquoise .
at least 800,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the space of 100 days in 1994 .

so-called " grey entrepreneurs " account for approximately 15 % of all business start-ups in england and wales , according to a barclays bank survey .
entrepreneurs aged 50 and over are becoming a force to be reckoned with in the uk economy barclays bank this compares with 10 % a decade ago .
older entrepreneurs are also responsible for 50 % more start-ups in absolute terms than they were 10 years ago .
barclays said that " entrepreneurs aged 50 and over are becoming a force to be reckoned with in the uk economy " .
demographic shift the growth in older business owners has been attributed to a demographic shift , where it is more common for older people to work past 50 .
it also reflects the composition of today 's population .
more than a third of people will be older than 55 in 2025 , compared with a current one in four .
redundancies , retirement or dissatisfaction with previous jobs are spurring older people to start up their own companies .
nearly a fifth of " grey " start-ups were founded using redundancy payments .
and more than half of them set up in an area the owner had worked in before .
less money however , the older generation tends to make less money than younger entrepreneurs .
average turnover for businesses owned by the over 50s is £ 70,000 compared with a national average of £ 104,000 .
but to offset this , the older owner-manager faces less stress as only 27 % rely on the business as the family 's sole source of income .
and older people seem to think more clearly about objectives and pitfalls , according to the survey .
while 43 % of grey start-ups prepared a business plan before going it alone , only 23 % of under-50s did , the report added .
research for the survey was conducted in april , using a sample of 473 businesses with turnover of less than £ 1m . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's greg wood " the older entrepeneur can still teach the whizzkids ... a thing or two " the bbc 's martin lewis " an extra level of skill and experience is helping these firms to blossom " owner of chelsea flowers , jane owers " there is certainly an element of risk , in terms of the quality of my retirement " how healthy is uk plc ?

it took four years to re-open one section of the dee beds and , earlier in the month , cocklers were warned more areas could be closed because some fisheren had breached their zones .

the agency has said it will inspect the beds after the meeting and decide on whether to re-open more beds so that mature cockles can be fished again .

in early trade on tuesday , the euro rose to a 3.5-month high of about 110.50 yen , up from 109.76 yen late in new york .
the bank of japan loosened its monetary policy on tuesday , effectively cutting interest rates and sending the yen lower on the foreign exchange markets .
meanwhile , the euro firmed slightly against the us dollar to 89.72 cents , up from 89.62 cents in late monday trade .
on monday the euro at one point climbed to 90.06 cents , breaking through the 90 cent barrier for the first time since 26 april , although in later trade it fell back slightly .
there was some hope of respite for the uk 's hard pressed exporters as the euro also gained ground against the pound to hit its highest level for five months .
in early trade in london on tuesday , a euro was worth more than 63.3p.
inflation risk eases some short-term support for the euro is flowing from hopes that the european central bank will reduce interest rates for only the second time this year , perhaps as soon as 30 august , some economists said .
retail sales figures in germany , released on 13 august , were even worse than expected , encouraging hopes of a rate cut from the ecb at the end of august or at the following meeting on 13 september , said westlb currency strategist michael klawitter .
" we expect that eurozone inflation will be favourable -lrb- for a rate cut -rrb- , " he said .
" this is something investors are betting on , and is supplying some mild support . "
the latest monthly report from the ecb , released on 9 august , said " sizeable " risks remained to growth in the eurozone .
the ecb also said inflationary pressures in the 12-country eurozone may be easing .
marc hendriks , currency strategist at socgen in london , agreed that the ecb will cut rates within a few weeks , with at least one further cut expected later in the year .
in may , the bank cut a quarter-point , to 4.5 % .
all eyes on the us but the euro 's surge is unlikely to last , he said .
like mr klawitter , he stressed that the us is the real story , following on from the depressing outlook in the beige book which spoke of stagnating growth .
a mass of us economic data is due out this week , from retail sales numbers on tuesday via industrial production and consumer prices to trade balance figures and the well-regarded university of michigan consumer sentiment survey on friday .
results from key companies such as computer maker hewlett-packard are also due this week .
these are likely to demonstrate that the pain felt by us corporations is set to persist , said mr klawitter .
flood of data the consumer numbers in particular are eagerly awaited .
with manufacturing in the doldrums , consumer spending has helped support the us economy this year , and significant slippage could trigger further pressure on the dollar .
" the dollar was only as high as it was because there was nothing else to buy , " he said , pointing to the continuing weakness of eurozone economies and of other possible candidates such as the swiss franc .
" now that 's gone too , and there 's nothing to buy at all . "
the euro is likely to stay within a range of 85-92 cents for the rest of the year , mr hendriks said .
whatever its current woes , the us economy is still a better bet than europe for a recovery some time early next year , he said .
