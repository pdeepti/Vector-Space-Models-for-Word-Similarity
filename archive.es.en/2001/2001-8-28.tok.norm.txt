nato hopes that by wednesday it will have gathered a third of its target of over 3,000 - a figure macedonian prime minister ljubco georgievski has called " ridiculously low " .
the rebels have agreed to surrender the weapons as part of a peace plan which includes greater rights for macedonia 's ethnic albanian minority .
on monday the rebels released seven more of the prisoners they have been holding in the north of the country .
eight were set free the previous day in an apparent gesture of goodwill .
the international red cross says all 15 prisoners had been seized in or around the second city of tetovo .
death of a soldier but monday was overshadowed by the death of a british soldier - sapper ian collins of the 9th parachute squadron , royal engineers - killed near the capital , skopje , after youths threw a lump of concrete at his vehicle .
weapons handover to include : two tanks two armoured personnel carriers six anti-tank weapons 130 mortars 210 machine guns his death did not halt the weapons collection , which began hours later in a barn in the village of otjla , near the town of kumanovo .
the arsenal included more than 350 kalashnikovs - but heavy machine-guns , landmines and mortars were also surrendered .
some of the weapons were new , nato said - countering speculation that the national liberation army would hand over only its oldest , poorest arms .
the surrendered weapons will be moved to a special arms dump in the centre of macedonia , run by greek forces , before being taken out of the country and destroyed .
despite nato 's satisfaction at the first day 's work , questions remain over how effective the weapons collection will be .
nato commanders say the operation will result in a meaningful reduction in weapons and is an important step towards disbanding the guerrillas .
new demands but nationalist elements within the macedonian government have dismissed the exercise , alleging that the rebels possess an arsenal of at least 70,000 arms .
the collection of weapons is a key part of an agreement designed to end months of conflict in the balkan state .
in return , the macedonian government has agreed to various amendments to the constitution that will benefit the country 's ethnic albanian minority .
however , hours before the operation began , the government put forward a new set of demands .
an adviser to macedonian president boris trajkovski told the bbc that security forces expected to be in a position to re-occupy territory held by ethnic albanian rebels by the end of the operation .
the government also wanted to see the swift return of up to 50,000 macedonians forcibly displaced from their homes , and the release of all prisoners held by the nla .

although uk grocers in the late 1990s opened a gloves-off fight for customers , there has been a " marked relaxation in the intensity of competition " in the sector in the last nine months , a report by consultants verdict research said .
verdict put the rise down to the integration of a new management team at asda , the us retailer bought by wal-mart two years ago .
asda , which wal-mart has pledged to take above sainsbury and even tesco in the uk supermarket league , is now poised to spark a new battle for trade , the report said .
the opening shots in the price war could be fired by christmas , to the benefit of customers and the uk as a whole , the consultancy said .
" a more competitive trading environment should be good news for customers and the economy at large , both beneficiaries of low inflation , " the report said .
asda unrest asda 's leading role in the grocery wars assumes minimal disruption from the loss of company president paul mason , who it was announced on friday has been poached by discount retailer matalan .
the loss represented the second top-ranking resignation in less than a year , after allan leighton quit as president last september .
seven other senior staff members have quit , including mike coupe , who joined iceland as managing director , and justin king , now managing director of food at marks & spencer .
tony denunzio , wal-mart 's european finance chief , is currently seen as favourite to become asda 's next president ..
tesco praised in tuesday 's report , verdict also said it rated tesco as the uk 's highest rated supermarket , thanks largely to the retailer 's " growing skill as a hypermarket operator " .
while waitrose and marks & spencer remain strong in the grocery sector , sainsbury and safeway may fare less well from a price war , the report said .

the new-york based group says the security forces targeted northerners and muslims , seen as supporting opposition leader alassane ouattara in last year 's elections .
africans have often been the victims of racism but they can also be perpetrators human rights watch the report , " the new racism " was released ahead of the united nations world conference against racism , which opens in south africa on friday .
peter takirambudde , head of hrw 's africa division said : " the world conference should condemn the ivorian leaders who have promoted intolerance based on ethnic and religious differences . "
' state-sponsored violence ' " africans have often been the victims of racism but they can also be perpetrators , " he said .
the group says that more than 200 people were killed in the past year , while others were tortured , raped and arbitrarily detained .
it calls this " state-sponsored violence " saying that the paramilitary police , or gendarmes , were largely responsible .
the protests forced guei out of office but then degenerated into ethnic clashes earlier this month , eight gendarmes were found not guilty of massacring 57 civilians , whose bodies were found in a field on the outskirts of the commercial capital , abidjan , days after last october 's presidential elections .
the only two survivors said they were too afraid to testify in the military court .
the bbc 's west africa correspondent mark doyle says that the past two years have seen ivory coast descend from being one of the most stable countries in africa to one where many citizens and foreign residents feel insecure .
' immunity ' during the controversial poll , the gendarmes crucially took the side of laurent gbagbo - who won - against military leader robert guei , who had tried to remain in power despite losing the popular vote .
by the time of parliamentary elections in december , the report says , " the relationship between the security forces and the youth wing of gbagbo 's party had consolidated , with the latter enjoying complete immunity , even when they committed atrocities in the presence of gendarmes and police . "
gbagbo inherited ethnic tensions but has used them for his own political ends the december poll as also marred by serious violence , including threats from some northern areas to secede from ivory coast .
human rights watch accepts that president gbagbo was not the first ivorian leader to manipulate ethnic tensions but says he " failed to take credible steps to bring to justice the perpetrators of violent human rights crimes " .
mr gbagbo 's two predecessors , mr guei and the man he ousted , henri konan-bedie , prevented mr ouattara standing for elections , accusing him of being a foreigner , from neighbouring burkina-faso .
observers say that this created a climate in which northerners and muslims were seen as being foreign .

the exploits of homer and bart and the rest of his yellow family from springfield triumphed in a viewers ' vote for a channel 4 bank holiday special .
the muppet show , which brought us the unlikely coupling of kermit and miss piggy , came in second .
the entire poll was revealed in reverse order on channel 4 's the 100 greatest kids ' tv shows , presented by jamie theakston and the puppet cast of rainbow .
it was compiled by viewers voting by telephone and the internet .
british cartoon dangermouse took the third position in the poll , with the pink and white saggy cat bagpuss close behind .
the long-running school drama grange hill - a launch pad for many uk soap stars - was voted fifth favourite .
animated shows mr benn and scooby doo , alongside rainbow , also made it into the top 10 .
and it seems viewers remember and prefer the old favourites to new shows such as the tweenies and the teletubbies , as they came only 83rd and 90th in the poll .
homer simpson , head of the cartoon clan , had previously topped the channel 4 poll to find the greatest tv character of all time , beating the likes of basil fawlty , ali g and inspector morse .
as well as clips from the 100 top children 's shows , viewers were also treated to some behind the scenes secrets .
rick jones , who presented and operated the puppets on fingerbobs , came clean about having " drowned " the mouse .
" we 'd done the last shot of the second series and i did n't want there to be a third series believe me - two years under that table was enough , " said jones .
" i conspired with the cameraman to keep the camera rolling .
i took the mouse and dumped him in my cold cup of coffee - and drowned him . "
bob the builder narrator neil morrissey , who topped last year 's christmas charts with a song from the show , had his own story .

animated shows mr benn and scooby doo , alongside rainbow , also made it into the top 10 .
not forgotten : grange hill characters zammo and jackie and it seems viewers remember and prefer the old favourites to new shows such as the tweenies and the teletubbies , as they came only 83rd and 90th in the poll .
homer simpson , head of the cartoon clan , had previously topped the channel 4 poll to find the greatest tv character of all time , beating the likes of basil fawlty , ali g and inspector morse .

" we 'd done the last shot of the second series and i did n't want there to be a third series believe me - two years under that table was enough , " said jones .
" i conspired with the cameraman to keep the camera rolling .
i took the mouse and dumped him in my cold cup of coffee - and drowned him . "

at last , u2 are back in scotland for an unexpected , but most welcome two-date gig in glasgow .
on monday , concert-goers at the city 's secc could hardly believe they were watching one of the world 's biggest live bands .
a week ago none had been expecting to see bono and the boys performing their elevation tour .
fans clapped and cheered at the secc the lead singer thanked the dedicated followers for queuing up to snap up the gold-dust tickets and he gave a tongue-in-cheek apology to those who had planned to watch telly that evening .
bono was the showman - clad in cool black leather and donning those dark shades we expect a popstar of his standing to wear .
-lrb- but , may i add , sporting noticeably comfy black trainers . -rrb-
his voice is what helps to make u2 one of the best .
he is also a performer who teases and controls his audience .
pushing the buttons to applause from fans he peeled off his shades during staring at the sun and rubbed his eyes under the glare of the venue lights .
he took a t-shirt from the crowd to wipe his sweaty face , he sipped water from the bottle of a ca n't-quite-believe-it fan , he told his followers " if we bomb in glasgow then that 's the end of u2 " .
bono knows what buttons to push , and push he does .
indeed his god-like status allows him to get away with political statements on the g8 , the un council , jubilee 2000 and northern ireland - his fans appear to love him all the more for it .
guitarist the edge really knows how to make his talent sing for many a u2 concert-goer the live performance is a spiritual experience .
when bono dedicated a song to his father , it was n't just a case of " and this one 's for me dead dad " .
bono tells us it 's to celebrate the new body of his pa , whose old cancer-ravaged one is now gone forever .
during the latter stages of the elevation tour , the lead singer 's dying father was mentioned nightly - such a dedication helped to make that all-important connection with the audience .
u2 is a band of simplicity , a lead singer , lead guitarist , bass player and drummer .
the chorus-line but they do have harmony , they do have percussion and they do have a chorus line - thanks to the fans .
they make the concerts - they know the words , they know the tunes , they know to breath at the right moment and they know when to keep silent .
the u2 fan is well practised , he rehearses in the bath , rehearses in bed and rehearses in the car .
bono , the showman on monday we all got the chance to be the chorus line , to be part of the beat that resonated throughout .
when u2 were in scotland for their 1997 pop mart tour the venue was murrayfield - justifiably big and outdoors .
this was an altogether different affair - firstly an out-of-the-blue treat for scottish fans and for these international superstars a rather intimate setting .
the 9,000-strong crowd were at an almost touching distance from the gods of rock .
it 's easy to dwell on front man bono , but u2 are a band with an outstanding drummer , bassist and lead guitarist .
sweet-sounding violin there 's no 20-piece orchestra , no backing singers and no stage dancers - so its up to the four irishmen to make it work .
guitarist the edge really knows how to make his talent sing .
here is a man who can take his instrument and produce from it the sweetest-sounding violin or the power-pumped beat of a drum kit .
missing from this monday night set were my personal favourites - gloria , tomorrow , i still have n't found what i am looking for , rejoice and in god 's country - a list of highlights from that inspired 1980-90 era .
but i have to accept that the group has moved on , written new songs and collected along the way a new generation of fans .
audience favourites were undoubtedly that u2 signature tune sunday bloody sunday and i will follow .
and by the time where the streets have no name boomed out of the speakers it was definitely a case of forget about drinking the lager - let 's throw it in the air , rip off our t-shirts and jump as high as we can .
can you think of a better way to react ?
two hours after they took to the stage , u2 bowed and left .
the thousands filed out of the secc sporting big grins lit up by the clear red moon .
ah , what a beautiful day , what a beautiful night .
