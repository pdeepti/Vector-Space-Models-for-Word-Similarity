the move is seen as key to avoiding a massive debt default that would make the country 's recession worse .
latin america 's third largest economy is burdened by $ 123bn -lrb- £ 88.2bn -rrb- worth of debts ; it spends about a fifth of its budget to service it .
under the agreement , the provinces will accept getting a smaller share of the country 's tax revenues in exchange for a financial restructuring of its debts that will save them vast amounts of money .
but the largest and most indebted province , buenos aires , along with a further nine opposition led provinces , has refused to fall in line .
and without the backing of buenos aires , where a third of the 37 million argentine people live , the country may be heading towards economic disaster .
annual savings " the provinces will make an annual saving of more than $ 1bn in interest rate payments , " said economy minister domingo cavallo failure to sign up to the deal means no access to a debt swap that would cut interest payments for the provinces , mr cavallo has warned those that remain opposed .
this approach has left many cash-strapped provinces with little choice but to accept .
" politically , mr cavallo will gain the upper hand if he uses this incentive method , " said bnp paribas fixed income strategist owi ruivivar .
remaining obstacles having reached the agreement with four opposition provinces , the government will continue its struggle to get all the country 's 23 provinces to agree to a reduction of their share of national tax revenues .
this should help argentina balance its budget , a condition for continued economic assistance from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the international community .
landing the deal with the four provinces is seen as a significant step forward for the argentine government , but serious obstacles remain .
in addition to the four , the government had previously received the backing of loyal centre-left provinces .
but many analysts remain cautious , until buenos aires makes a final decision .
" although all the information points to the possibility of reaching a pact with the governors this week , we estimate the possibility of having to announce a temporary moratorium on public debt payments is higher , " said maxinver investment consultant eduardo blasco .

the double agent is thought to be the " young englishman " sent on the deadly mission in early 1937 , who features in mi5 documents released at the public record office on wednesday .
but the plot , allegedly ordered by soviet leader josef stalin , failed after a key spymaster was recalled to moscow .
general franco went on to rule spain for 39 years the documents also reveal that mi6 had its own man inside the soviet communist congress of 1920 .
what the mole reported was later ' planted ' in the times of london on the orders of winston churchill , who was then minister for war in the lloyd george coalition government .
details of the franco plot were devised by nikolai yezhov , head of ogpu , the soviet secret police , according to an mi5 memo by soviet defector general walter krivitsky .
' fanatical ' yezhov instructed another agent , paul hardt , to find an englishman to carry out the job .
" he did in fact contact and sent to spain a young englishman , a journalist of good family , an idealist and a fanatical anti-nazi , " said gen krivitsky in his memo .
the words " prob philby " were later written next to this passage in the margin of the document by an intelligence officer .
the spy reported lenin 's message to the secret congress philby was a journalist covering the spanish civil war for the times when the alleged plan was hatched .
the memo continues : " before the plan matured , hardt himself was recalled to moscow and disappeared . "
general franco 's forces went on to win the war and the dictator ruled spain for 39 years .
philby , head of the notorious cambridge spy ring which leaked sensitive state secrets to the ussr , fled to russia in the 1960s after the extent of his deceit was unmasked .
lenin 's message disclosures about the moscow mole are made in copies of mi6 papers about the late soviet leader vladimir ilyich lenin , compiled by the domestic security service mi5 .
the third international in moscow in september 1920 was a critical moment for lenin and the fledgling soviet government , mapping a new global strategy while preparing to deal with its own post-war problems .
the daily herald featured nicolai yezhov , former head of the soviet secret service delegations of communist parties from all over europe came to moscow - even a three-man delegation from switzerland .
it was one of the swiss delegation , pastor humbert droz , from la chaux de fonds , whose report to mi6 in london appears on the file .
he gives a concise and detailed account of lenin 's message to the secret congress : that russia was the seed-bed for communist revolution elsewhere in europe that the versailles treaty which ended the first world war must be smashed that the source of french and british wealth , their colonies , must be destabilised , in africa and india churchill told mi5 to leak the droz report , adding sternly that " it must not appear as having been furnished by the war office " .
the file shows the result of these endeavours , a cutting from the london times some weeks later , on 6 november , 1920 .

thirty-thousand police officers were deployed along the route ; some used batons and dogs to remove demonstrators who tried to block the line .
the train , with six containers of nuclear waste , was escorted by a fleet of police helicopters on the final stretch of its journey to the german city of dannenberg .
from there , it was transported by road to a nearby storage site at gorleben .
the 1,500km -lrb- 940-mile -rrb- journey from a reprocessing plant in france has been beset by demonstrations from protesters - although in far fewer numbers than earlier this year , when a similar convoy passed through .
15,000 german police were on hand up to 1,000 demonstrators had gathered at dannenberg , the shipment 's last rail stop , but they were kept at least 500 metres -lrb- yards -rrb- back from the fortified unloading area in a field outside the town .
protester maik weidemann , said : " you just ca n't get anywhere near the track .
we 've been denied the right to demonstrate . "
the police were clad in riot gear and joined by armoured vehicles carrying water cannon .
police said they had briefly detained about 100 people , and a number of people were treated for injuries , including some who had been bitten by police dogs and struck by batons .
previous clashes protesters did manage to delay the train by chaining themselves to the rail tracks and trees along the train 's route , but they were swiftly removed by police .
dannenberg was the scene of the most violent protests during a similar shipment of waste earlier this year .
at that time the police bill was around 50 million marks .
" it wo n't be any less this time , " said a police spokesman .
german obligation it was not immediately clear when the road shipment would proceed to the gorleben storage facility , although authorities said the transfer of the six containers of waste onto road vehicles would take about six hours .
the nuclear shipment is being returned from a reprocessing facility at la hague in france and is the second such train this year .
the last train to make the journey , in march , was beset by protests and delayed for 16 hours .
germany has no reprocessing plant of its own and is legally obliged to take back the spent fuel abroad for treatment .
the government has agreed to phase out nuclear power over a period of 20 years , but that is far too long for many anti-nuclear protesters , for whom the twice-yearly shipments to gorleben have become the principal focus of their campaigning . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's patrick bartlett " the train arrived here in the late afternoon " see also : 11 nov 01 -pipe- europe nuclear train heads for germany 23 apr 01 -pipe- europe germany 's nuclear waste headache 15 jun 00 -pipe- europe analysis : germany 's alternatives to nuclear 28 mar 01 -pipe- europe germany 's anti-nuclear protesters 28 mar 01 -pipe- sci / tech nuclear waste : a long-lived legacy internet links : germany 's government international atomic energy authority germany 's environment ministry green peace robin wood -lrb- in german -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top europe stories now : mass resignations rock turkey crash pilots given conflicting orders serbia jails first war criminal new hope for aids vaccine ukraine mine death toll rises russian anti-jewish sign explodes sicilians dish up anti-mafia pasta finland and sweden plan ' eurocity ' links to more europe stories are at the foot of the page .

thirty-thousand police officers were deployed along the route ; some used batons and dogs to remove demonstrators who tried to block the line .
the train , with six containers of nuclear waste , was escorted by a fleet of police helicopters on the final stretch of its journey to the german city of dannenberg .
from there , it was transported by road to a nearby storage site at gorleben .
the 1,500km -lrb- 940-mile -rrb- journey from a reprocessing plant in france has been beset by demonstrations from protesters - although in far fewer numbers than earlier this year , when a similar convoy passed through .
up to 1,000 demonstrators had gathered at dannenberg , the shipment 's last rail stop , but they were kept at least 500 metres -lrb- yards -rrb- back from the fortified unloading area in a field outside the town .
protester maik weidemann , said : " you just ca n't get anywhere near the track .
we 've been denied the right to demonstrate . "
the police were clad in riot gear and joined by armoured vehicles carrying water cannon .
police said they had briefly detained about 100 people , and a number of people were treated for injuries , including some who had been bitten by police dogs and struck by batons .
previous clashes protesters did manage to delay the train by chaining themselves to the rail tracks and trees along the train 's route , but they were swiftly removed by police .
dannenberg was the scene of the most violent protests during a similar shipment of waste earlier this year .
at that time the police bill was around 50 million marks .
" it wo n't be any less this time , " said a police spokesman .
german obligation it was not immediately clear when the road shipment would proceed to the gorleben storage facility , although authorities said the transfer of the six containers of waste onto road vehicles would take about six hours .
the nuclear shipment is being returned from a reprocessing facility at la hague in france and is the second such train this year .
the last train to make the journey , in march , was beset by protests and delayed for 16 hours .
germany has no reprocessing plant of its own and is legally obliged to take back the spent fuel abroad for treatment .
the government has agreed to phase out nuclear power over a period of 20 years , but that is far too long for many anti-nuclear protesters , for whom the twice-yearly shipments to gorleben have become the principal focus of their campaigning .

bbc news online 's tom geoghegan investigates why sales have dropped .
camelot has denied that national lottery ticket sales are falling .
the company insisted that the 16 % drop in the saturday game had been offset by a 21 % incremental sales increase in the midweek lottery game .
a spokeswoman said people were not losing interest and that the total sales of tickets had been maintained , at £ 90m a week .
she said : " the saturday game has decreased , but it was expected because as with other lottery games overseas , the sales are always high when it is introduced , then the trial period finishes .
lottery facts so far £ 342.3m unclaimed £ 16.3bn prizes 1213 millionaires £ 148.5m sales in one week , jan 1996 " we 've introduced new types of games to try to appeal to different people .
" some people like to just play to win the jackpot , while others prefer more prizes . "
in june camelot promised an aggressive marketing campaign after sales dipped below £ 5bn for the first time in four years .
but it has met its target of raising £ 10.5bn for good causes in its first seven years .
the report , called an economist 's guide to lottery design , was written by professor ian walker of warwick university and juliet young of the national economics research associates .
it was published as a review of the first seven years before camelot begins its new licence in january 2002 .
runaway success the report concluded that the initial runaway success of the lottery was hit by the introduction of the midweek game .
it said : " while the wednesday draw has been successful by international standards , regularly selling about £ 25m , its introduction has reduced saturday sales dramatically .
" now saturday plus wednesday sales only just match saturday sales before the midweek game was launched . "
it said that lottery extra , which is just one jackpot prize , had flopped .
however , camelot pointed out that it generated revenues of £ 130m a year .
the report also observed that good causes revenue might be higher if the ' take-out ' - the proportion of sales returned as prize money - were smaller .
but camelot said sales would fall if the prize fund was reduced , because most people play to win , not to give to charity .
tax on the poor ?
the firm denied it was a tax on the poor by saying there was no evidence to suggest people on low incomes spent proportionately more money on tickets than others .
it would not divulge if there were any changes planned for the new licence , although it did concede there would be a one-off , christmas millionaire maker game .
a spokeswoman also said that there were plans for expanding into other areas such as mobile phones , digital television and the internet over the next couple of years .
camelot was controversially given the new licence by the national lottery commission , ahead of richard branson 's people 's lottery .

mr bush announced the largest , unilateral cuts in nuclear weapons ever contemplated by an american president .
within the next decade , he said , the american arsenal would shrink from 7,000 warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 warheads .
america has proposed slashing the number of nuclear warheads in return ?
not much , apparently .
mr putin said he would " try to respond in kind " .
yet russia 's rusting missile collection could soon shrink to as few as 1,000 warheads of its own accord .
and on the issue of missile defence , he had nothing to offer .
for weeks washington has been alive with rumours of a " grand compromise " .
american missile cuts in return for russian agreement to the testing of a missile defence system .
but at the last minute , either the russians have played hard to get , or the practicalities have defeated them .
conflicting aims what they are trying to achieve may simply be impossible .
washington wants to test a missile defence system .
president bush wants to establish a missile defence shield moscow wants to keep the anti-ballistic missile treaty which explicitly outlaws tests .
even the most creative lawyers have trouble squaring that circle .
amending the treaty is out of the question .
with that dilemma unresolved , there are two reasons for mr bush 's apparent generosity .
his right-wing supporters are opposed , more to the principle of arms control than to the details of any specific deal .
the whole idea that the united states should be tied down by treaties is anathema .
hence mr bush 's decision to go ahead with a unilateral missile cut , without waiting for a quid pro quo .
new relationship but it is also true that the relationship between the two countries has been transformed since 11 september .
president putin made a very astute call , when he managed to be the first foreign leader to convey his condolences on that terrible day .
president putin says he will ' try to respond in kind ' to america 's offer on arms he has also made real sacrifices - removing his objections to the stationing of us forces in the central asian republic of tajikistan , for example .
washington needs that help .
it also sees longer term benefits in cultivating a new relationship with russia .
and if , as president bush keeps declaring , it is time to get rid of the last vestiges of the cold war , why does the united states still need some 7,000 warheads pointed at russia ?
stark choice nevertheless , the absence of a deal on missile defence would leave mr bush with a tricky dilemma .
he would then face the choice between renouncing the anti-ballistic missile treaty - not an attractive option despite american bravado - or compromising on the missile defence scheme .
the two presidents have two days in the congenial surroundings of mr bush 's ranch to resolve their differences .
the anti-ballistic missile treaty may be only a piece of paper , but at the moment it is looking like one of the most powerful weapons the russians have got .

amending the treaty is out of the question .
with that dilemma unresolved , there are two reasons for mr bush 's apparent generosity .
his right-wing supporters are opposed , more to the principle of arms control than to the details of any specific deal .
the whole idea that the united states should be tied down by treaties is anathema .
hence mr bush 's decision to go ahead with a unilateral missile cut , without waiting for a quid pro quo .
new relationship but it is also true that the relationship between the two countries has been transformed since 11 september .
president putin made a very astute call , when he managed to be the first foreign leader to convey his condolences on that terrible day .
he has also made real sacrifices - removing his objections to the stationing of us forces in the central asian republic of tajikistan , for example .
washington needs that help .
it also sees longer term benefits in cultivating a new relationship with russia .
and if , as president bush keeps declaring , it is time to get rid of the last vestiges of the cold war , why does the united states still need some 7,000 warheads pointed at russia ?
stark choice nevertheless , the absence of a deal on missile defence would leave mr bush with a tricky dilemma .
he would then face the choice between renouncing the anti-ballistic missile treaty - not an attractive option despite american bravado - or compromising on the missile defence scheme .
the two presidents have two days in the congenial surroundings of mr bush 's ranch to resolve their differences .
the anti-ballistic missile treaty may be only a piece of paper , but at the moment it is looking like one of the most powerful weapons the russians have got .

world trade organisation spokesman keith rockwell said that the draft was being presented on a " take it or leave it " basis as the " last best shot " to reach a deal .
negotiators have worked through the night to find an acceptable draft agreement and overcome big remaining differences , after the trade talks overran their scheduled conclusion .

agriculture the key the key to european union gains in other areas was its readiness to accept compromise language to get a deal on agriculture .
initially , the eu has been resisting pressure for an agreement in principle to phase out agricultural subsidies .
other countries , especially from the cairns group of agricultural exporting nations , have been pressing the eu to reduce its generous agricultural subsidies under the common agricultural policy , worth $ 90bn a year .
they say the aim of negotiations should be a " substantial reduction in , with a view towards phasing out , agricultural export subsidies " .
now the eu has accepted this language , provided that it is accompanied by the words that " without prejudging the outcome of the negotiations . "
environment gains in return , the eu wants to ensure that the issue of trade and the environment is firmly on the agenda for the next round of trade talks .
it has now got an commitment to an accelerated work programme in this area and the acceptance of national environmental impact statements as part of future trade deals .
there will also be discussion on eco-labelling , which may be illegal under current trade rules .
eu trade ministers are expected to approve the deal at a meeting of the eu general affairs council at the intercontinental hotel this morning .
but they may be forced to make further concessions to thailand and the philippines over the level of tariffs on tuna .
this was after both countries objected to a separate deal between the eu and the group of african , caribbean and pacific countries , granting them trade preferences .

the survey was launched on world diabetes day , which also saw the announcement of the largest-ever study aimed at preventing type two diabetes and cardiovascular disease -lrb- cvd -rrb- .
the navigator study , run by the drug company novartis , will run to 2007 and will involve patients in 40 countries .
the charity diabetes uk said a global explosion in the number of diabetes cases was threatening to reverse the reduction in the number of heart disease related deaths in the west .
picking up changes in blood glucose levels early reduces the chances of diabetics developing serious complications such as heart disease , kidney disease and eye or nerve damage .
regular blood glucose monitoring is important for good diabetes control simon o 'neil , diabetes uk but checking levels involves a painful finger-prick test , which deters many from carrying out the test .
the survey , of 1,330 diabetics , found over half said pain was a issue when testing , particularly for 21-35-year-olds , two-thirds of whom said it was a problem .
almost half of under-35s reported sore and bleeding fingertips .
a quarter had suffered loss of feeling or even temporary loss of use .
four out of five diabetics have to monitor their glucose levels regularly for at least two years .
and over half are supposed to check between one and five times a day .
the survey was sponsored by the abbott laboratories , medisense products , the makers of the soft-sense meter , also launched on world diabetes day , which promises normally pain-free testing .
it allows diabetics to test for glucose levels in areas less sensitive than their fingertips such as the forearm , the fleshy part of the upper arm and the base of the thumb .
simon o 'neil , head of care developments for the charity diabetes uk , said : " regular blood glucose monitoring is important for good diabetes control .
" it can also help prevent diabetes complications from developing . "
he added : " we are delighted that meters like soft-sense can help make regular blood glucose monitoring easier and pain-free for people with diabetes . "
insulin there are currently 1.4m people diagnosed with diabetes in britain .
people with type two , or non-insulin dependent diabetes , do not make enough insulin , or are unable to make proper use of it .
without enough insulin , the body can not move blood sugar into the cells .
sugar builds up in the bloodstream and causes health problems .
type one diabetes - also known as insulin-dependent or immune-mediated diabetes - is a disease that that destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce the hormone insulin .
insulin is needed to control blood sugar levels .
without it , death is inevitable .
prevention the navigator study will look at whether the long-term administration of the drugs nateglinine -lrb- starlix -rrb- and valsartan -lrb- diovan -rrb- can reduce or delay the development of type two diabetes and cvd in people with a condition called impaired glucose tolerance -lrb- igt -rrb- .
one in seven people over 40 has igt .
up to 50 % will develop type two diabetes within 10 years .
igt sufferers are also at increased risk of developing cvd .
scientists think starlix may be able to reverse the effects of igt .
diovan may help prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes .
people with diabetes are two to four times more likely to suffer a heart attack than those without , and 70 % of people with diabetes will die as a result of cvd .
lead researcher rury holman , professor of diabetic medicine at oxford university , said : " igt is a silent condition which put unsuspecting people at dual risk , since they may well develop both diabetes and cvd . "
