" launching strikes against any arab country under any pretence would lead to severe complications , " arab league secretary general amr moussa told egyptian radio as the league 's foreign ministers gathered .
we support all measures taken by the united states to resist terrorism egyptian president hosni mubarak the 22 ministers of the arab league countries met in doha , the capital of qatar , to reach a joint position on the us strikes against afghanistan .
the meeting preceded a larger meeting including the 57 foreign ministers of the organisation of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- in doha on wednesday .
mohammad al-amin saif , the foreign minister of comoros , which currently chairs the ministerial council , said the purpose of tuesday 's conference was " to formulate a united stand " .
the qatar foreign minister , sheikh hamad al thani , said the aims of the conference were to articulate the arab nations ' condemnation of terrorism , but warn against an unstudied retaliation .
split on us strikes he said they needed to see the perpetrators of the 11 september attacks on the united states in court .
but the bbc 's frank gardner in doha says a split has emerged between those who support the us military action , and those who condemn it .
he says that the syrian delegate left early and iraq 's foreign minister , naji sabri , condemned washington 's actions , while his gulf arab counterparts broadly supported them .
as the delegates urged the us not to widen the strikes to other nations , mr sabri told the bbc he had " no reason to believe " his country would be the next target , because it had no relations with osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network , the group blamed for the attacks onj new york and washington .
raids ' premature ' mr saif pointed out that the arab countries had condemned the attacks .
" but the raids are premature , " he said , expressing the unease felt also by other arab countries in light of the us attack .
egyptian president hosni mubarak , who has fought against islamic fundamentalism in his own country , expressed his support for the alliance on tuesday , but asked that civilian casualties be avoided .
" we support all measures taken by the united states to resist terrorism , " he said , calling at the same time for the establishment of a palestinian state .
mr moussa said the arab position would be " fierce " if arab countries were attacked within the context of the ongoing campaign .
" we could never accept strikes against any arab country , particularly since the accusations made by the united states focused on specific camps , which have been linked to what happened in new york and washington , " he said .
omani foreign minister yussuf bin alawi bin abdullah said arab countries would continue supporting the united states as long as its operations " come within the anti-terror fight . "
but he , too , warned that the " arab league will not accept any move that might target an arab country , " according to ona , the official omani news agency .
popular dissent uk prime minister tony blair told the arab countries in an interview on al-jazeera , which was dubbed into arabic , that bin laden was as much a threat to the middle east as he was to the west .
our correspondent says that is a message that moderate arab governments have mostly failed to get across to their people .
now they face a growing problem from disillusioned citizens who can see few benefits from being friends with america and the west .
across the middle east , governments are battling to rein in hardline elements .
in the gaza strip , three palestinians were killed in violent clashes with their own security forces following a pro-bin laden demonstration on monday .
egypt and even oman , where demonstrations are very rare , have had two straight days of student protests against the us attacks on afghanistan .

the spokesman , sulaiman abu ghaith , was speaking in a pre-recorded message broadcast by the qatar-based television station al-jazeera .
there are thousands of the islamic nation 's youths who are eager to die just as the americans are eager to live sulaiman abu ghaith he praised the suicide attacks against america on 11 september and said there would be more of them .
the ruling taleban regime in afghanistan has said that it will free up bin laden , whom it is sheltering , to wage this jihad .
he had previously been barred by the regime from using telephones , fax machines and the internet .
taleban spokesman abdul hai mutmaen told the bbc 's pashto service that all previous restrictions on the saudi-born dissident would be lifted following the us-led air raids .
' crusade ' abu ghaith said in his statement : " the americans should know that the storm of plane attacks will not abate .
there are thousands of the islamic nation 's youths who are eager to die just as the americans are eager to live . "
he said the us and britain , by attacking afghanistan , had opened a door that would never be closed .
several times , he used the word " crusade " as a derogatory term to describe the actions of the us and its western allies .
the message from abu ghaith was the second statement by al-qaeda since the launch of us-led air strikes against afghanistan on sunday .
bin laden issued a videotaped message the same day , though it appeared to have been recorded before the attacks began .
abu ghaith said : " us interests are spread throughout the world .
so , every muslim should carry out his real role to champion his islamic nation and religion .
" carrying out terrorism against the oppressors is one of the tenets of our religion . "
he said those who carried out devastating attacks on new york and washington with hijacked aircraft had " done a good deed " and taken the battle to the heart of america .
" let the united states know that the battle will continue to be waged on its territory until it leaves our land , stops its support for the jews , and lifts the unjust embargo on the iraqi people . "
state department criticism the message was similar to bin laden 's earlier statement , which interpreted the battle between the us and al-qaeda as one between the west and israel against the interests of muslims .
an official from the al-jazeera station told the reuters news agency it had received the video recorded statement in the afghan capital kabul on tuesday .

the spokesman , sulaiman abu ghaith , was speaking in a pre-recorded message broadcast by the qatar-based television station al-jazeera .
there are thousands of the islamic nation 's youths who are eager to die just as the americans are eager to live sulaiman abu ghaith he praised the suicide attacks against america on 11 september and said there would be more of them .
the ruling taleban regime in afghanistan has said that it will free up bin laden , whom it is sheltering , to wage this jihad .
he had previously been barred by the regime from using telephones , fax machines and the internet .
taleban spokesman abdul hai mutmaen told the bbc 's pashto service that all previous restrictions on the saudi-born dissident would be lifted following the us-led air raids .
' crusade ' abu ghaith said in his statement : " the americans should know that the storm of plane attacks will not abate .
there are thousands of the islamic nation 's youths who are eager to die just as the americans are eager to live . "
he said the us and britain , by attacking afghanistan , had opened a door that would never be closed .
several times , he used the word " crusade " as a derogatory term to describe the actions of the us and its western allies .
the rhetoric echoed bin laden 's broadcast the message from abu ghaith was the second statement by al-qaeda since the launch of us-led air strikes against afghanistan on sunday .
bin laden issued a videotaped message the same day , though it appeared to have been recorded before the attacks began .
abu ghaith said : " us interests are spread throughout the world .
so , every muslim should carry out his real role to champion his islamic nation and religion .
" carrying out terrorism against the oppressors is one of the tenets of our religion . "
he said those who carried out devastating attacks on new york and washington with hijacked aircraft had " done a good deed " and taken the battle to the heart of america .
" let the united states know that the battle will continue to be waged on its territory until it leaves our land , stops its support for the jews , and lifts the unjust embargo on the iraqi people . "
state department criticism the message was similar to bin laden 's earlier statement , which interpreted the battle between the us and al-qaeda as one between the west and israel against the interests of muslims .
an official from the al-jazeera station told the reuters news agency it had received the video recorded statement in the afghan capital kabul on tuesday .
it was not clear why abu ghaith rather than bin laden made the recording .

megabite vouchers are an alternative to people giving money to rough sleepers , which they know will go towards food .
the scheme began 10 years ago in exeter at the city 's palace gate project .

and there are plans to set up 40 projects across the uk over the next three years .
the " meal square " vouchers are fraud-resistant , credit card-sized tokens worth Â£ 1 , which people can buy from their local megabite project .
once they have been spent , the food outlet sends them back to the local project and is reimbursed .
trevor gardner , palace gate project community development manager , developed the scheme in exeter .
he said : " local people wanted to help people begging in the street but felt anxious about giving them money . "
he developed a fraud-proof system with serial numbered vouchers .
many homeless people want to eat better food homeless people can take the vouchers to any of five food outlets in exeter , where they can exchange them for food and soft drinks .
mr gardner said : " it allows people to help while getting rid of all the risk .
" they know the money they donate is not going towards tobacco , alcohol or drugs . "
since they were launched , more than 30,000 tokens have been bought and dished out .
mr gardner said he was " proud and relieved " the scheme is expanding .
he said : " it will be great to just get on with my own scheme and know that the next inquiry i get from leicester or inverness can be passed on to someone else . "
government figures estimate that some 50,000 people live on the streets during the day and seek financial help through begging .

local day centres are encouraged to be part of megabite franchises and details of national helplines and local services are given on the backs of the " meal squares " .
mr gardner said : " it is never going to solve the problem of homelessness but we can alleviate the crisis when people need feeding . "

the entire upper half of belize - including the northern cayes so brutalised by hurricane keith last year - was completely spared by hurricane iris .
but just the opposite is true of the south .
it seems almost every village has been damaged in some way .
i am thankful to be alive , but this is so much worse than i imagined it would be placencia residen miraculously , however , the only deaths reported so far were aboard tourist dive boats which capsized .
no fatalities have been reported in local communities .
this , despite concern that many people - unused to hurricanes in this part of the country - had not heeded warnings and evacuated in time .
since sunday afternoon , belizeans throughout the country were glued to their radios and watching the us weather stations to monitor the storm .
now , the day after iris hit hard and fast , they are listening to damage reports and getting relief supplies together .
coastal damage iris did not come near belize city as was first feared and even the southern towns of dangriga and punta gorda escaped with minimal damage .
but iris wrought havoc in smaller costal communities , most of which are comprised of wooden houses with zinc roofs built on stilts , or palm thatch with adobe walls .
the storm 's eye passed closest to monkey river town .
although there was a mandatory evacuation , 75 people stayed to weather the storm .
now the survivors and the evacuees are coming back to , as one woman put it , " nothing , nothing , nothing " .
local resident : " it 's all mashed up " only two buildings remain upright in monkey river .
everything else is matchsticks .
the story is little better in independence , big creek and placencia .
an estimated 95 % of the small inns , restaurants , dive shops and bars in placencia - a popular tourist destination known for its sandy beaches - was flattened by the 140 mph winds .
a woman identified only as christine called a radio station on monday night in despair .
" i am standing here looking at what used to be placencia , " she said .
" hardly anything is still standing , including my hotel .
i am thankful to be alive , but this is so much worse than i imagined it would be . "
tourists killed in the big creek , a port where belize 's bananas are shipped out , two dive boats with tourists capsized .
the number of lives lost is still in dispute .
the latest reports are 11 dead , 11 more missing .
several other fishing boats and catamarans that were on their way to honduras when the storm hit have not been heard from since monday .
the tourists killed are believed to have been us citizens while no casualties have been reported thus far in the southern district of toledo , hundreds of families , predominately mayas , have been left homeless in scattered villages .
the district 's largest town , punta gorda , escaped with mainly downed power lines .
but the surrounding communities , most of which have almost no cement buildings , have been levelled .
little warning was given in toledo , since initial projections were that the storm would hit somewhere between belize city and dangriga .
at the last minute the storm made a southerly turn giving the toledo district a pounding .
the district was last hit by a hurricane in 1942 .
to compound the problems of providing adequate warning , many residents speak mainly spanish and there is only one belizean radio station , broadcasting in english , which reaches this southernmost district .
ill-prepared paul mahung , of punta gorda , was worried before iris hit land that his district might not be adequately prepared , that people might not be taking the warnings seriously or would wait until the last minute to move to higher ground .
even then , higher ground often meant retreating to villages with only one or two concrete buildings .
a mayan rights activist and community leader , valentino shal , says the people of toledor are in desperate need of shelter .
local resident : " it was something out of a scary movie " " last night we had hundreds of people coming into the churches , with only the clothes on their backs , babies wrapped in plastic bags , " she said .
" they had to stand shoulder to shoulder , they could n't sleep last night .
" we do n't know where they are going to sleep tonight . "
in the community of big falls , 800 of the 1,000 residents lost their houses .
the story is duplicated throughout the district .
hundreds of those left homeless are children .
cry for help villagers are making desperate appeals for water , food and basic necessities .
building supplies are urgently needed .
mennonite farmers in western belize are already shipping supplies of rice , beans and corn .
relief agencies in the united states and mexico are sending supplies .
the belize red cross and the government 's department of human development are also swinging into action .
in the long term , the southern district also face heavy crop losses since rice , beans and corn which were just about to be harvested , have been destroyed .
the stann creek district is where belize 's main banana and citrus farms are located .
the damage to these and belize 's burgeoning shrimp farming industry has not yet been tabulated .
in response to the disaster , those in the northern part of the country are donating supplies to their southern neighbours .
in the north the mood is one of relief at escaping another storm , particularly following hurricane keith last year and a near miss by mitch in 1998 .
but in the south , the reality of loss is just setting in and it will only be lessened when the people find that help is on the way .

" they had to stand shoulder to shoulder , they could n't sleep last night .
" we do n't know where they are going to sleep tonight . "
in the community of big falls , 800 of the 1,000 residents lost their houses .
the story is duplicated throughout the district .
hundreds of those left homeless are children .
cry for help villagers are making desperate appeals for water , food and basic necessities .
building supplies are urgently needed .
mennonite farmers in western belize are already shipping supplies of rice , beans and corn .
relief agencies in the united states and mexico are sending supplies .
the belize red cross and the government 's department of human development are also swinging into action .
in the long term , the southern district also face heavy crop losses since rice , beans and corn which were just about to be harvested , have been destroyed .
the stann creek district is where belize 's main banana and citrus farms are located .
the damage to these and belize 's burgeoning shrimp farming industry has not yet been tabulated .
in response to the disaster , those in the northern part of the country are donating supplies to their southern neighbours .
in the north the mood is one of relief at escaping another storm , particularly following hurricane keith last year and a near miss by mitch in 1998 .
but in the south , the reality of loss is just setting in and it will only be lessened when the people find that help is on the way .

the dogs are being trained to carry out new tasks and to work with new equipment to make the job of the police safer .
the use of newy technology now means that a firearms dog can now be fitted with a camera on its head .
everything it sees , the police can see through a portable monitor .
the " wireless operated live video exploration system " is just one of the ways the dogs are making the role of the police a safer one .
catching a criminal who has escaped up a ladder poses no problems for one dog at the devonport-based unit .
the dog , dino , has learned to climb with his handler .
he can now be strapped to the officer 's front with a special harness so he can be lifted to where he is needed .
dog handler and instructor pc george collins said : " basically , it 's to make it more comfortable for the dog and to give the handler the ability to use his hands when scaling heights that would n't normally be entertained . "
the previous harness was used purely by the handler holding it in his hand like a carrier bag , which made it awkward for him .
but the new harness , which has been in use for the last eight months , can help increase response times during an incident .
only the top 10 % of the mod dogs make it through the ranks to work alongside the elite tactical firearms unit .
the canines that master the skills of filming and climbing are now proving invaluable to the police .

the poster which showed the man sliding down a banister and carried the slogan " if smirnoff made painkillers " was slammed by the advertising standards authority because they believed his private parts were just about visible .
smirnoff 's owners , guinness united distillers and vintners , reject the claim , insisting that the man was actually wearing skin-coloured pants , adding that the advert did not set out to offend .
the watchdog said that whether or not he was wearing pants , the general public would assume he was not and therefore the advert would be likely to cause offence .
the company also said the advert was meant to be a " humorous , visual pun and was part of a campaign using surreal humour depicting the improbable and bizarre " .
it rejected an assertion by the watchdog that the advert could encourage people to drink excessively .
guinness has promised not to run the advert again .
