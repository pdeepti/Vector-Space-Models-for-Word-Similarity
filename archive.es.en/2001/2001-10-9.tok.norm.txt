it is what they have being training for ever since the pentagon formed special operations command in 1986 , in the wake of the debacle of desert one , the failed attempt to spring american hostages from iran .
there are 46,000 troops in special operations command , which is based at macdill air force base in florida .
they are a mixture of green berets , rangers and the delta force from the army , the seals -lrb- which stands for sea-air-land -rrb- from the navy and the air force 's combat controllers and para rescue teams .
there are three levels of special operations .
special , which are operations which the government will admit to openly .
clandestine , which the government will try to hide but acknowledge if uncovered .
covert , which a government will deny all knowledge of .
covert are usually commanded by jsoc , a secret group within special operations command .
usually , it is only the delta and seal teams that get to do covert ops .
' targets of opportunity ' the special operations teams are almost certainly moving into afghanistan now to take advantage of the confusion on the ground caused by waves of air attacks .
they will have several roles .
firstly , they will be working with the northern alliance , calling in us air assets in support of attacks by afghan commanders .
they will also give the afghan commanders some basic training and perhaps provide them with equipment such as radios and night sights .
other groups will act as long-range reconnaissance units , feeding back to the pentagon invaluable real-time intelligence about the disposition and condition of taleban forces on the ground .
if they see a chance , they can call in air strikes - anything from a cruise missile to b-1 bombers - on what they call " targets of opportunity " such as a sudden gathering of taleban forces .
the hunt for al qaeda finally , some of the units will have been given the mission to hunt down and kill the leaders of al-qaeda .
the key to their success will be having " actionable intelligence " - information that they can act on .
afghanistan is the size of texas , so they need to know with at least an 80 % degree of certainty the exact location of the target before they will act .
and right now there is a huge effort underway to get that information .
in the words of one former special operations officer , " they are using everything they have " .
high technology intelligence using radio intercepts , aerial reconnaissance and infrared sensors as well as low tech methods such as spending a lot of cash bribing disgruntled or former members of the taleban and al-qaeda .
it explains donald rumsfeld 's cryptic comment the other day that " it 's not going to be a cruise missile or a bomber that is going to be the determining factor .
it 's going to be a scrap of information . "
in the operation , british sas troops will probably work alongside the americans .
the small teams of soldiers will be flown in on high-speed air-refuellable helicopters and dropped as close as possible to the targets .
it will probably be a bloody battle .
reinforcements waiting everyone expects that osama bin laden will be protected by several hundred very experienced fighters .
but not far behind the special operations strike teams will be sizeable reinforcements to extract them if things go wrong .
insufficient support was one of the reasons why the operation to capture the somali warlord mohamed farrah aidid in october 1993 resulted in the deaths of 18 american soldiers .
the bloody scenes in mogadishu sapped domestic support for the mission and led to a us pullout .
the us does not want to make the same mistake again .

speaking ahead of tuesday 's first meeting of the british war cabinet , he used the interview with qatari satellite television station al-jazeera to counter claims by osama bin laden that the us-led action was aimed at the islamic world .

" i can not understand how a person who studies islam and the koran can justify the killing of 7,000 innocent persons .
" so , we act not because we want to act but because we are forced to act .
" we do not want to wage war and enter into conflicts . "
mr blair told the arabic channel that bin laden 's al-qaeda network posed as big a threat to moderate arab states as it did to the west .
" this is not about the west versus islam , " he said .
" decent muslims , millions of them in european countries have condemned these acts of terrorism in new york and elsewhere in america with every bit as much force as any of the rest of us . "
" let us be clear when we listen to the words of osama bin laden , if he has his way the regimes that he would replace regimes in the arab world with would be like the taleban in afghanistan .
" i do n't believe that anybody seriously wants to live under that kind of regime . "

mr hoon told bbc 2 's newsnight programme that it was not yet known how successful the tomahawk missile strikes launched from uk submarines had been .

it now emerges it was that very tuesday that mr bush decided the time had arrived for the united states to act - exactly three weeks after the devastating attacks on new york and the pentagon .
" he called me to the oval office and told me he was preparing to launch a military operation and asked me to start thinking about an address to the nation , " said white house adviser karen hughes .
five days and two diplomatic missions later , us and british forces had blasted afghan targets , and mr bush delivered that speech .
final manoeuvres soon after the 11 september attacks , mr bush was declaring a " war of the 21st century " which would " whip terrorists " , disturbing those who wanted a considered response from the us .
but such talk was soon toned down and a more restrained rhetoric introduced , with the focus on coalitions and consensus .
in the days leading up to the strikes , two key diplomatic missions were under way .
on the wednesday of last week , us defence secretary donald rumsfeld started what was to be washington 's last attempt to shore up arab support for military strikes against bin laden and his network before those strikes began , trying to find friends in saudi arabia , oman and egypt .
and a day later , mr bush 's " truest friend " , british prime minister tony blair , started another two-day diplomatic mission which took him to russia and pakistan - the latter seen as particularly crucial to any coalition , given its former close ties with the taleban .
while his colleagues were busy abroad , mr bush came to the decision as to the final timing of his strikes during a briefing with his military planners on the friday , according to national security advisor condoleezza rice .
she said that mr bush had asked whether army general tommy franks , commander of the forces in the gulf and the middle east , was ready to get going .
" yes sir , " replied general richard myers , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
" the president sat back and said : ' all right then .
we 're ready to go ' , " said ms rice .
on saturday , mr rumsfeld returned and mr blair was back .
everything , and everyone , was in place .
go the president then spent the weekend at camp david , alternating between a football game between the university of oklahoma and the university of texas , mr bush 's home-state , and issuing final orders to send the bombers on their way .
early sunday , he left to address the national fire academy near camp david , speaking at a memorial honouring the 300 fire-fighters who died in service when the world trade center collapsed .
he then travelled to the white house .
with the exception of britain , international leaders , including those of france , germany and russia , were only informed of the strikes shortly before they were launched .
then , at 1:00 pm local time , mr bush turned to his country for a televised address .
" on my orders , the united states military has begun strikes against al-qaeda terrorist training camps and military installations of the taleban regime in afghanistan , " he said .
" the battle is now joined on many fronts .
we will not waver .
we will not tire .
we will not falter and we will not fail , " mr bush said .

its report " invisible children " suggests that more than 132,000 children out of an estimated 500,000 in the region are brought up in families living on or below the breadline .
report author and barnardo 's scheme co-ordinator , dr owen gill , told bbc news online the report highlighted hidden poverty in what is perceived as a " wealthy " part of england .
the charity is now calling for urgent government action to address child poverty .
poverty is condemning far too many children to a bleak future dr owen gill , barnardo 's report author bristol-based dr gill carried out the research during summer 2001 in bristol , bath , gloucestershire , somerset and wiltshire .
his figures were compiled using government statistics on income-deprived families , which rely on benefits .
the report suggests they often have worse health , achieve less at school and as a result are less likely to get the better jobs in society .
' bleak future ' dr gill said : " there is a clear link between poverty and negative outcomes in life .
" what we are saying is that poverty is condemning far too many children to a bleak future . "
according to the report , rural areas in the west are some of the worst affected .
in taunton , somerset , 37 % percent of children are brought up in poverty .
dr gill 's research included detailed interviews with parents on benefits .
a common theme to emerge was the problem of repaying social fund loans .
people on low incomes can apply for this money to help fund large purchases such as furniture .
repayments are deducted at source from benefits which can leave families short .
the report showed that becky knight , a lone parent with one child , on a benefit of £ 100.40 a week was having that benefit cut to £ 89.40 as she had to pay £ 11 a week for her social fund loan .
the deduction prevented her from buying things beyond the bare necessities for her daughter toni .
ms knight said : " i get by .
it 's just the extras you 've never got .
like if toni is ill , i 've never got any money for calpol , and things like that . "
barnardo 's says replacing the loans with grants would have a positive impact on the poorest in society .
' lost childhood ' a second theme to emerge from the research was the bleakness of day-to-day life .
dr gill said : " children and parents need to feel there is some leeway , some scope for the occasional treat .
but there is n't .
" as one parent said to me ' kids lose their childhood when money is short . '
there is never anything to look forward to . "
he went on : " we need to say it loud and clear that children have rights to adequate resources , regardless of their parents ' ability to get a job . "

poverty is condemning far too many children to a bleak future dr owen gill , barnardo 's report author bristol-based dr gill carried out the research during summer 2001 in bristol , bath , gloucestershire , somerset and wiltshire .
his figures were compiled using government statistics on income-deprived families , which rely on benefits .
the report suggests they often have worse health , achieve less at school and as a result are less likely to get the better jobs in society .
' bleak future ' dr gill said : " there is a clear link between poverty and negative outcomes in life .
" what we are saying is that poverty is condemning far too many children to a bleak future . "
according to the report , rural areas in the west are some of the worst affected .
in taunton , somerset , 37 % percent of children are brought up in poverty .
dr gill 's research included detailed interviews with parents on benefits .
barnardo 's says 37 % of taunton children are poor a common theme to emerge was the problem of repaying social fund loans .
people on low incomes can apply for this money to help fund large purchases such as furniture .
repayments are deducted at source from benefits which can leave families short .
the report showed that becky knight , a lone parent with one child , on a benefit of £ 100.40 a week was having that benefit cut to £ 89.40 as she had to pay £ 11 a week for her social fund loan .
the deduction prevented her from buying things beyond the bare necessities for her daughter toni .
ms knight said : " i get by .
it 's just the extras you 've never got .
like if toni is ill , i 've never got any money for calpol , and things like that . "
barnardo 's says replacing the loans with grants would have a positive impact on the poorest in society .
' lost childhood ' a second theme to emerge from the research was the bleakness of day-to-day life .
dr gill said : " children and parents need to feel there is some leeway , some scope for the occasional treat .
but there is n't .
" as one parent said to me ' kids lose their childhood when money is short . '
there is never anything to look forward to . "
he went on : " we need to say it loud and clear that children have rights to adequate resources , regardless of their parents ' ability to get a job . "

jonathan attwell , 10 , fell 500ft during the walk along the east side of wales 's highest mountain in october 1999 .
peter finlay , 51 , was accused of negligence after the incident , during which he was leading a party of 12 scouts from bristol .
it follows monday 's evidence from a snowdonia national park senior warden who said the route was unsuitable for experienced walkers .
sam roberts , who was on the mountain when the incident happened , said that attempting the descent with inexperienced climbers was akin to throwing someone learning to swim into the deep end of a pool .
' inappropriate ' the court also heard from outward bound trust climbing expert and safety adviser roger barton , who said the route was " inappropriate " and " over-ambitious " for a climbing party which included novices .
the jury heard that four of the 12-strong group had not scaled snowdon previously .
mr barton said that one slip could be very dangerous .
he claimed mr finlay was not qualified enough to lead the scouts on the mountain .
earlier in the trial , some of the boys told the court they turned around to find jonathan , of oldland common in bristol , had disappeared from view .
earlier in the trial , the court heard he had been " left to pick his way down " the mountain in north wales , alone and unsupervised .
but electrical engineer mr finlay , from the warmley area , strongly denies the charge and the defence claims necessary preparations were made .
in evidence , assistant leader matthew wilson has said both he and mr finlay had received training for climbing and descending the mountain with the boys .
' sunny day ' they discussed a plan to go down an appropriate path , he told the court .
mr wilson said the path down which the group was walking was slippery , but he claimed the weather was good for climbing .
it was a " fine and sunny day , " the court heard .
prosecution counsel robin spencer qc said earlier that the boy 's death was " a tragic accident " - but one which should never have happened .
the court was told how the older boys were led by mr finlay from the front with the youngest at the rear of the group .
evidence was heard that some of the younger boys had gradually become separated from the leaders .
one of the boys told the court that jonathan said he was scared as the group tried to descend a rocky scree .
but mr finlay had said the group would go at the pace of the slowest member .
the boy was the youngest of the party , and the defendant had been taking scouting expeditions for several years .
mr finlay denies the charges and the case continues .

low-income families in the uk are being hit by repayments on government social fund loans for emergency household costs .
the research , called invisible children , suggests that one in four children miss out on necessities such as clothing because their family benefit is reduced by the payments .
many families think that benefit levels are simply not adequate for bringing up children dr owen gill dr owen gill , who carried out the research for barnardo 's , is campaigning for the social fund to be made up completely of grants .
he said : " far too many families across the country on income support are simply surviving because they have to pay back money .
" right across our services , the majority of really hard-pressed families are struggling to repay social fund loans .
" that means they are living £ 10 or more below the rock bottom poverty line .
social funds " our research has shown clearly that many families think that benefit levels are simply not adequate for bringing up children . "
social funds are made up of a combination of loans and grants : funeral payment loans , maternity grants , crisis loans and community care grants .
wider welfare reforms are concentrated on making work pay alistair darling work and pensions secretary more than 2.5 million families in britain take advantage of this .
he said : " the single thing that would have the greatest immediate impact on children 's poverty would be placing loans with grants . "
welfare reforms alistair darling , secretary of state for work and pensions , said : " the social fund is designed to complement other measures to help the poorest and most vulnerable in our society , but alone it can not lift people from poverty .
" that is why the government 's wider welfare reforms are concentrated on making work pay and encouraging responsibility and independence for those who can work , whilst also ensuring support for those who can not . "
more than two million families in britain rely on income support according to government figures .
a further million receive job-seekers allowance .
the study was conducted on children and families in affluent areas of the south west - bristol , bath , gloucestershire , somerset and wiltshire .
support levels it shows that a quarter of all families in both the urban and rural areas do not have enough money to live on and to provide for their children 's development , because of the reductions to their benefits .
income support levels vary according to the size of the family and the number of adults .

ms knight said : " i get by .
it 's just the extras you 've never got .
psychological effects " like if toni is ill , i 've never got any money for calpol , and things like that . "
dr gill believes that poverty has damaging psychological effects on children .
he said : " children and parents need to feel there is some leeway , and some scope for the occasional treat .
but there is n't .
" as one parent said to me , ' kids lose their childhood when money is short - there is never anything to look forward to . " '

members of the anti-war movement , which is based in the city , were voicing their outrage at the us and british air strikes on afghanistan .
the organisation came together following the 11 september terrorist attacks in america , in anticipation of retaliatory action by the us .
they held up placards and chanted slogans such as : " new world order , stop the slaughter " .
tom preier : " we oppose war of any kind " spokesman thomas preier told bbc news online : " we are opposed to any kind of war .
" each and every one of us is appalled at what happened in america .
no-one would condone that .
" we feel very strongly we do n't want any further bloodshed .
the poor afghan people would bear the brunt of any armed response .
half the population is already starving , there are seven million refugees and a huge crisis . "
he claimed bombing would not solve anything .
" i do n't think there 's any such thing as a surgical strike or military targets without what they call collatoral damage .
" it 's a horrible word for the loss of human life . "
he said the alternative to war was to look at why america had been targeted in the first place .
michael reinsborough : " need to address root cause " " really it is because of american policy in the middle east .
america 's involvement in palestine was absolutely atrocious , " he said .
american michael reinsborough , who is originally from maine - but now lives in belfast - said many people living in the us were against military action .
" there 's a huge peace movement in america pushing against this .
much of the world is upset at american foreign policy , " he said .
" the news media in america does not report very strongly what the actual affects of american foreign policy are .
" i 'm sure people in kabul are terrified tonight of being bombed .
if we are confronting terrorism with terror what does that say about an effective response . "
saddened he said it was necessary to look at root causes of the problem .
" we 're pumping weapons into countries around the world and supporting dictatorships that are positive for corporate business rather than looking at genuine human rights and long term causes . "
earlier , a prominent member of the islamic community in northern ireland said many muslims were saddened by the military action .
mamoun mobayed said they were concerned at the potential loss of life .
" the muslim community in northern ireland is sharing the same feelings like many , many people around the world , that violence , whether it is in the form of terrorism or war , is painful and hurtful to so many people , " he said .
however , irish foreign minister brian cowen said afghanistan 's taliban regime had brought the overnight air strikes on itself by failing to hand over suspected terrorist osama bin laden .
mr cowen , who is currently chairing meetings of the united nations security council , said ireland supported the " multi-faceted " action intended to take out key taleban military installations .
