bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- turk telecom faces privatisation low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : europe front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo sunday , 13 may , 2001 , 05:09 gmt 06:09 uk turk telecom faces privatisation turkish pm bulent ecevit : determined to pass the law by chris morris in istanbul the turkish parliament has approved laws to privatise the state-owned telephone company , turk telecom , and to reform the country 's troubled banking sector .
the government was determined to pass the laws in order to secure $ 10bn in new emergency loans .
the executive board of the international monetary fund will meet on tuesday to discuss the aid package for turkey , which is now almost certain to be approved .
there was political haggling in the turkish parliament right until the end , and there are still reports of bitter disputes within the government about the new privatisation law and the pace of reforms demanded by the international monetary fund .
ecevit 's row with president ahmet necdet sezer sparked a collapse in investors ' confidence turk telecom will be put up for sale , but a foreign investor can buy no more than 45 % of the company .
the turkish state will retain a golden share to maintain its influence and reduce military concerns about the sale of what the generals see as a strategic asset .
the problem is that many analysts believe it is all rather academic .
turkey , they believe , will not find a major foreign buyer in the telecom sector .
this privatisation has been delayed for years and now is not a good time to sell .
nevertheless , the legal framework for a sale should be enough for the imf to aprove the release of the new loans to help turkey stabilise its banking sector and meet its debt repayment .
parliament has also passed a law to reform the banking system and make it easier to seize the assets of corrupt bank owners .
sorting out the mess in the economy will cost a lot more than turkey is going to receive from abroad .
that means it needs to cut spending and increase revenue collections substantially if it is going to balance the books .
that is not good news for ordinary turks , who have already suffered badly in the last few months .
hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost and prices have risen dramatically , but the economic crisis is by no means over .

secretary of great yarmouth inshore fishermen 's association paul lines , said : " they 've taken all the top layers of the seabed away and when the fish come there 's no food left for them . "
" we 've seen our fishing grounds slowly pinched from us by gradual expansion further eastwards .
" when dredging first started we lived with it by going further outside of the dredgers .
" but slowly they acquired more and more dredging areas to the point where we have to go 12 miles out to sea before we can get clear of them .
" and in the winter , that 's not safe . "
dredging grounds very quickly recover and the marine life rapidly returns to them within almost three years british marine aggregates producers association many local authorities along the east coast are concerned that dredging is speeding up coastal erosion .
great yarmouth has repeatedly objected to new dredging licences and the government has announced plans to introduce tighter controls .
but andrew bellamy , a spokesman for the british marine aggregates producers association - the trade association representing dredging companies - said : " independent research has shown that the dredging grounds very quickly recover and the marine life rapidly returns to them within almost three years .

humour and tenderness critics praised his style as being unpretentious and natural .
he wrote with ironic humour and tenderness about the struggles of ordinary people .
others described him as a writer who represented the common man , who understood the realities of rural life and cared passionately about rural development and good governance in india .
many indians came to know his characters through a major television series here .
he was a close friend of the late british author , graham greene , who is said to have described him as one of the greatest contemporary writers in english .

the elections are being seen as the first major test for president gloria arroyo 's government , which came to office in january when her predecessor , joseph estrada , was ousted over a corruption scandal .
thirteen out of 24 senate seats and hundreds of lower house and municipal seats are being contested in the elections .
ms arroyo needs to score a convincing victory in both houses to bolster her position and ensure the passage of key bills .
legislator marcial punzalan and one of his aides were shot dead when they were confronted by armed men in quezon province , south of the capital manila .
and a grenade attack at a rally in maguindanao province in the southern philippines is reported to have killed four supporters of a mayoral candidate and injured 30 other people .
in total , about 60 people have died during the election campaign .
up to 5,000 troops have been placed under the command of the election commission for deployment to violence-prone areas .
family threatened this comes amid allegations that an assassination team has targeted president gloria arroyo 's family .
mrs arroyo said in a radio interview she had received an intelligence report that a nine-man squad had threatened to kill or kidnap her family .
she said the main target was her son , jose miguel , who is a candidate in the senate elections .
she did not say who was behind the plot or whether the threat still existed .
meanwhile , former president joseph estrada and his son jose - who are both in jail accused of corruption while he was in office - have been taken to a military hospital complaining of illness .
mr estrada had earlier urged supporters in a taped message to vote against the threat of dictatorship and accused mrs arroyo 's government of instilling fear in the poor .
last friday , a court decided to let mr estrada vote in the elections in his home area of san juan in manila , but police said that they could not guarantee his safety .
