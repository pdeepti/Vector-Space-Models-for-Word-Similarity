i 'm sure armenians and azeris say similar things about each other .
the hatred between the two nations goes back for generations , culminating in the six-year war they fought over nagorno-karabakh , the rolling landscape that straddles the mountains between armenia and azerbaijan .
nagorno-karabakh , many say , is the most beautiful part of the region , awash with vineyards and fig trees .
i 'm told watermelons as big as footballs grow in the fields and pomegranate and persimmon trees groan beneath the weight of their heavy fruit .
nagorno-karabakh 's uncertain future but that could just be nostalgia speaking .
humanitarian aid agencies working in both countries say parts of nagorno-karabakh are so thick with landmines , much of the region is now completely out of bounds .
earlier this year , two little boys were playing football in the fizuli district , near nagorno-karabakh .
as they chased each other , one of them stood on a mine .
he lost his leg and died later that day in hospital .
his friend has shrapnel wounds so deep he will never be able to play football again .
the war ended in an unsatisfactory ceasefire - more unsatisfactory for the azeris than for the armenians , who got to keep most of the land and six of the surrounding territories - in 1994 .
the azeri capital , baku hanging on the wall of our home in the azeri capital baku is a map of the republic of azerbaijan between 1918 and 1920 .
it 's enormous .
it consists of all of today 's azerbaijan , huge swathes of georgia and most of armenia .
" you see , " the woman in the map shop told me when i bought it .
" all of this used to be ours .
those wretched armenians have taken half our country . "
i 'm doubtful of the accuracy of the map - i think it was probably drawn in 1994 by azeri politicians to prove to armenians , foreign mediators and anyone else who would listen that azerbaijan was a giant empire before the armenians got hold of it .
i 've heard armenians have similar inflated maps of their own country .
suspicion and accusations the extent to which the two nations despise each other has reached new depths since the attacks in america .
almost as soon as the first of the twin towers collapsed , azeri commentators were blaming the armenians .
azerbaijan 's ans network spoke to its new york correspondent the day after the attacks .
" the two planes took off from boston , which has the second largest armenian community after california , " he told viewers triumphantly .
over in yerevan , the capital of armenia , there was speculation that the planes had both been carrying azeri nationals .
going to yerevan involves a detour to georgia last time i went to armenia , i took the car .
the border between azerbaijan and armenia is closed , so you have to go via georgia .
instead of an eight-hour trip , it takes the best part of two days .
on the georgian-armenian border , i had to unscrew my azeri number plates and put on temporary armenian ones .
ironically , the car , a bashed-up old niva , comes from a part of azerbaijan that 's now under armenian occupation .
the armenian border guard held my number plates at arm 's length as though they had gone bad .
" if armenians see your azeri plates , you could be in great danger , " he told me .
a couple of weeks ago , an envelope containing white powder turned up at the office of the head of azerbaijan 's trade union for the media .
the union head told reporters he was in no doubt that the envelope had come from armenia .
even the russian pop diva alla pugachova , who has had more top 10 hits than most russians have had bowls of borshch , is treated with suspicion because azeri politicians say her husband is half armenian .
when the pope visited armenia recently to celebrate the country 's 1,700th year of christianity , the azeris said he was taking sides .
they 've even gone off the chinese because a delegation of armenians went to china last week and signed a trade agreement .
nevertheless , for all the public hatred , you do hear stories of friendships between the enemies .
a retired soldier i know in baku told me his best friend in the army had been an armenian .
they served together in kazakhstan , near the border with russia .
" there were soldiers from all over the soviet union , " he told me , " but the man i got on best with came from armenia .
" for years we used to write to each other , " he said .
" but after a while it got too dangerous .
he was my greatest friend , but sadly i 'm azeri and he 's armenian .

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- row erupts over msp numbers categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 15 november , 2001 , 06:36 gmt row erupts over msp numbers mr salmond says he struck a deal with donald dewar the scottish national party 's westminster leader said that a private deal was struck with labour to ensure that the number of msps would not be cut after devolution .
alex salmond said he had a private agreement with the late first minister donald dewar that the terms of the scotland act would be changed to ensure that the scottish parliament still had 129 msps .
he said that the deal was struck in exchange for snp support during the devolution referendum in 1998 .
but his claims have been disputed by scotland office minister george foulkes who challenged mr salmond to produce some documentary evidence of the agreement .
alex salmond : " blatant hostility " speaking on bbc two 's newsnight scotland programme on wednesday , mr salmond said that he had seven meetings with mr dewar after labour 's 1997 election victory .
he said : " the purpose was to construct a common platform that would take us successfully though the referendum campaign . "
mr salmond said that mr dewar - then scottish secretary and later first minister - assured him that the issue of msp cuts would " be revisited " .
he said that mr dewar said it was " inconceivable " that the issue of cuts could be forced through over the head of the scottish parliament and that the late first minister did not expect this to happen .
the former snp leader said this commitment was made public the following year in the house of commons by mr dewar 's successor , henry mcleish , who was then a minister of state for scotland .
' complete fantasy ' mr salmond said he felt compelled to raise this issue now as mr dewar had since died and " henry is out of the game " .
he also cited what he called the " blatant hostility " of some backbench labour mps to the scottish parliament and said it was necessary to ensure that this did not affect the current review of numbers .
but mr salmond 's comments were disputed by scotland office minister george foulkes who challenged him to produce " documentary evidence " of any agreement .
george foulkes : " complete fantasy " speaking on the same programme , mr foulkes accused mr salmond of indulging in " complete fantasy " and trying to " rewrite history " .
" it is really quite ridiculous to suggest that alex salmond could have extracted any kind of promises out of donald dewar , " he said .
" i think it was the other way around . "
when asked if he thought mr salmond was making this up , mr foulkes agreed .
he added : " i would challenge him to produce any kind of evidence whatsoever to substantiate these claims . "
scotland act mr foulkes conceded that there was a commitment to " revisit " the issue of msp and scottish mp numbers but said this was currently being done through the current review being undertaken by scottish secretary helen liddell .
but he denied that anything concrete had been agreed between mr dewar and mr salmond .
under the terms of the scotland act the number of msps is linked to the number of scottish mps at westminster .
the act contains proposals to reduce the number of mps some time after 2007 - a move which would necessitate a reduction in the number of msps to keep the same ratio of representation .
under the review currently being conducted these plans could be revised - either in favour of the cut being brought forward or being abandoned indefinitely .

management said that a recent serious rock fall and major geological fault on the mine 's d4 face had necessitated its closure after operating losses spiralled to about £ 2m per month .
in a statement released on wednesday night , board chairman , professor ross harper , said there was " no alternative " to the redundancies .
the announcement came despite a recent £ 41m injection into the mine by the department of trade and industry .
professor harper said that 170 redundancies out of the mine 's workforce of 518 would need to be made to keep it operational .
he said : " we deeply regret any redundancies , but can see no alternative .
having commenced coal production from the new d2 face , we have , for some weeks now , also been hitting problems in our other major coal face , known as d4 .
" we had hoped to battle through , but the geological faulting is so serious that we have been unable to deliver our production targets .
" we now face both potential safety problems and the prospect of losing vital plant and machinery .
we feel we have no option but to close the face and salvage the equipment .
survival steps " this means we will lose production of up to 250,000 tonnes of coal . "
he said a drastic reduction in costs had to be undertaken to keep the mine operational and that the redundancies would help safeguard the pit 's long-term future .
prof harper added : " we believe we can stabilise both production and costs at a lower level .
if we take the right steps now , we will be best placed to survive for the future . "
the 170 job losses will take effect from this weekend .
management at the mine said that the 27 apprentices recruited during september will remain in employment and they hoped to recover the coal reserves on the d4 face following further mining operations in future years .

by bbc news online science editor dr david whitehouse one of the best meteor showers in decades could strike the earth around 18 november .
some experts say it could produce thousands of shooting stars each hour during its peak .
the leonid meteor shower takes place every november when the earth passes through the dusty remnants of comet tempel-tuttle .
tiny fragments , no bigger than sand grains , burn up in the atmosphere to produce fleeting streaks of light , or " shooting stars " .
and because this year the earth will be passing through a particularly dense swarm of dust , astronomers are hoping for a memorable display .
america , the pacific and asia should be best placed to see this year 's event .
possible storm comet tempel-tuttle orbits the sun every 33.25 years and leaves its trail of dusty debris in a slightly different path with every orbit .
the debris the earth encounters is normally sparse , producing about 10-15 meteors per hour at most .
just go outside and look up what might make this year exceptional is that comet tempel-tuttle last passed close to the sun in 1998 and left behind a much higher concentration of material in the inner solar system than in normal years .
the earth will pass close to three separate debris paths , which were created by close solar approaches in 1699 , 1767 and 1866 .
when the earth skims these paths there is the chance of increased meteor activity and possibly a meteor storm .
europe poorly placed the first encounter will occur when the earth passes close to the path created in 1767 , at about 1000 gmt on 18 november .
observers in north-western south america , central and north america will be well placed to see this .
the next possible outburst will occur about seven hours later at 1730 gmt from the debris path created in 1699 .
observers in eastern australia and the western pacific should get a good view of this one .
the last possible outburst may be the best as the earth passes very close to the 1866 path of the comet .
this will occur at 1815 gmt .
unfortunately , although most of europe and africa will be in darkness at this time , the debris will be hitting another part of the globe .
the shooting stars appear to come from the constellation of leo , but experienced meteor watchers say observers should be able to see streaks of light all over the sky .
the best advice is to just go out and look up .
it is a difficult business predicting meteor rates but analysts say as many as 100 shooting stars per minute might be seen at some stage on sunday .

voting took place on thursday and if he wins , william straw will follow in the the path of his father , who was president of leeds university students ' union in the late 1960s .
william , who hit the headlines in 1997 after being cautioned for cannabis possession , is up against two other candidates .
the result may be announced on friday .
during his career at the university , he has clashed with government policies , by campaigning against tuition fees for students .
the 21-year-old says he will remain " staunchly anti-fees " if he is elected .
his pledge follows a recent government proposal to scrap fees .
in his election statement , he vows to streamline the union 's council by " kicking out time-wasters " , and to monitor regularly student feelings at a " grass roots " level .
william will also look at the idea of creating a central student facility , something the university has never had .
he has previously been jcr president at new college .
minister 's embarrassment at the age of 17 william was accused of selling 1.92 grams of cannabis resin to a journalist from the mirror newspaper .
in a statement at the time , mr straw , then home secretary , said : " william is now learning the lessons of this episode and he has of course my full support in doing so . "
newspaper reports of mr straw 's son 's alleged action were a severe embarrassment to him , having been a hardliner who opposed legalisation of soft drugs .
after being president at leeds university students ' union , from 1967-68 , mr straw became president of the national union of students in 1969 .

the agreement , which the firms said was a " landmark strategic alliance " , could help it market more premium services , potentially including multimedia features such as music and movies .
for yahoo , the agreement provides monthly subscriber payments from sbc , promotion through sbc 's sales channels , and the ability to offer premium services via sbc 's communications and billing infrastructure - in the first instance , broadband internet access through sbc phone lines .
in return , yahoo will offer sbc a share of its non-subscriber revenue on advertising , e-commerce and other premium portal services .
but analysts remained unsatisfied that the sbc tie-up would represent a genuine source of revenue , or just one more vague alliance for the firm .
signs of hope yahoo 's shares rallied on the news , rising $ 1.24 to close at $ 15.21 .
investors were cheered that the alliance with sbc would move yahoo towards a distribution strategy for the wealth of online content it owns .
another potential benefit is that by teaming up with a company that already bills customers for a service , it could help yahoo collect money for more of its premium services .
it will also allow the development of new premium services , including unified messaging , a tool that enables users to check , store , manage and reply to voicemail , faxes and e-mail received from multiple sources .
the addition of premium services is crucial to the company 's strategy of moving away from a business model based on selling ads to support its free content .
questions remain the deal comes a day before yahoo holds its annual analyst meeting , at which it is likely to announce a corporate realignment , including possible job losses .
the firm revealed a net loss of $ 24.1m for the july-to-september quarter , compared with a $ 47.7m profit a year earlier .
analysts are likely to probe the firm for further details on the sbc deal , which some say is still worryingly vague .
there is still little information , for example , on the pricing of the new service , whether all of sbc 's high-speed internet customers would be migrated to the new service , and whether yahoo would be able to come up with enough new features to make it attractive .
nor has the company spelled out the potential for providing subscribers with entertainment content , such as movies and music , which many believe could be a major source of profit for online firms .
earlier this year , the company hired terry semel from warner brothers as its new chief executive .
the move sparked speculation that it was mulling a push into entertainment-related content , and away from its current mix of search services and news .

the firm revealed a net loss of $ 24.1m for the july-to-september quarter , compared with a $ 47.7m profit a year earlier .
terry semel may push the firm towards entertainment content analysts are likely to probe the firm for further details on the sbc deal , which some say is still worryingly vague .
there is still little information , for example , on the pricing of the new service , whether all of sbc 's high-speed internet customers would be migrated to the new service , and whether yahoo would be able to come up with enough new features to make it attractive .
nor has the company spelled out the potential for providing subscribers with entertainment content , such as movies and music , which many believe could be a major source of profit for online firms .
earlier this year , the company hired terry semel from warner brothers as its new chief executive .
the move sparked speculation that it was mulling a push into entertainment-related content , and away from its current mix of search services and news .

forces have been put on a heightened state of alert although any role they will take is likely to mainly involve the safe passage of humanitarian supplies , the prime minister told mps .
before the history books are written , we will continue to hunt them down until we find them for as long as it takes .
tony blair on thursday , mr blair continues his international diplomacy in downing street with talks with european commission president romano prodi and with austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel .
in wednesday 's commons statement on the latest developments in afghanistan , mr blair said several thousand soldiers were on 48 hours ' notice for deployment ahead of the arrival of a un-led force .
" the main purpose of these troops would be in the context of multinational efforts to make safe the humanitarian supply routes now opening up as a result of military progress , " he said .
" others may be focused on securing airfields and clearing unexploded ordnance and ensuring the safe return of the un and ngos -lrb- non-governmental organisations -rrb- to afghanistan , permitting the construction of the broad-based government that is so badly needed " .
conservative leader iain duncan smith said that recent events in afghanistan vindicated us-led military action .
he said : " had we heeded the calls -lrb- from those -rrb- who , for whatever reason , demanded a pause in the bombing , we would not have achieved the successes we 've achieved so far .
" nor would we be any closer to a situation in which effective humanitarian aid can now be brought through .
that is clear . "
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said that any troop deployment should be part of a co-ordinated effort to bring chief terror suspect osama bin laden to justice .
in his statement mr blair also said that northern alliance forces are now beginning to succeed in the south of the country having taken kabul on tuesday .
" it is now clear that the taleban regime is in a state of collapse across afghanistan . "
evidence the statement coincides with the publication of what the government says is new evidence against bin laden .
referring to that mr blair said : " the intelligence material now leaves no doubt whatever of the guilt of bin laden and his associates . "
he added : " they are terrorists , and history will judge them as such .
" before the history books are written , we will continue to hunt them down until we find them for as long as it takes . "
thoughts are already turning to the next steps for afghanistan , with a un-convened gathering of afghan factions and ethnic groups outside the war-torn country , probably in a gulf state , expected this weekend .
humanitarian corridors mr blair said : " the way the world supports the new afghanistan will be the clearest possible indication that the dreadful events of 11 september have resulted in a triumph for the international community as a force for good , and the defeat of the evil that is international terrorism . "
he added that moves were now afoot to ensure that humanitarian corridors were established to get vital supplies through to afghanistan 's food-starved population .
as ministers claim military advances in afghanistan give bin laden fewer places to hide , the british government says its updated evidence dossier will show the majority of the hijackers involved in terrorist attacks in the united states had links to his al-qaeda network .
mr blair previously said three of the men were directly connected .
the document also quotes from an unpublished video recording by bin laden that says : " let history be a witness that we are terrorists " .
uk troops for the lib dems mr kennedy expressed relief that there was " tangible progress " towards bringing bin laden to justice but said that relief would be tempered with apprehension over reported atrocities carried out by the northern alliance .
he offered his party 's " full support " for the " difficult and dangerous " task faced by british troops in the event of their deployment .

the resolution calls on all afghan parties involved in efforts to form a new government to accept an invitation from the un special representative for afghanistan , lakhdar brahimi , to attend a un conference aimed at putting these plans into place .

the uk has already put several thousand troops on standby .
un secretary general kofi annan said un personnel would begin returning to kabul on friday , and as the un had no military presence on the ground , he said , it had to rely on those already there .
the initial role of these forces , likely in the first instance to come from the us and the uk , would be to protect civilians .
they would also provide stability for any transitional authorities and provide security for international aid workers bringing assistance to the afghan people .

daniel radcliffe , the 12-year old british boy who looks set to achieve worldwide fame , has a quiet air of wonder about him .
he seems unfazed and unspoilt by the prospect of being scrutinised by millions of harry potter fans when the film of the much-loved book is released on 16 november .
" i 've always believed in magic , " radcliffe says , with a gently surprised expression that suggests he still ca n't believe his luck .
the young cast are working on a sequel film indeed , the last 16 months of his life have been something like enchanted - he was asked to audition for the part after eight months of casting calls had screened out tens of thousands of hopeful boys .
his reluctant and protective parents were gradually won over and he entered a world of " enormous fun " .
he even denies that the 130-day shoot , in which he had to be there almost all the time , was hard work .
" it was n't like a job for me , " he says .
" a lot of people say , ' oh god , i have to go into work today , ' but it 's not like that because it 's so exciting . "
when he saw the finished film for the first time , he left the theatre with his knees trembling .
radcliffe shot to fame in david copperfield " it was surreal , " he says .
" i thought i was going to be sitting there thinking ' oh yeah , that 's the day when that happened " .
but i was n't , i was totally caught up . "
of the three central child stars - emma watson plays hermione granger and rupert grint plays ron weasley - radcliffe was the only one with any professional acting experience .
nonetheless , conveying the complex emotions an orphan who lives with his nasty aunt and uncle until he finds out he 's a wizard might have proved challenging , were it not for the fact that he had played dickens ' david copperfield in a 1999 tv film .
" i 'd done being an orphan before , " radcliffe smiles .
fellow stars ron and hermione cast a spell " chris columbus -lrb- the director -rrb- says i have a knack for looking haunted . "
he was doubtless helped by harry potter 's big , round spectacles .
another challenge the role presented was keeping the looks of amazement fresh every time something magical happens to harry .
audiences may notice that radcliffe 's reactions to events - such as a baby dragon being born and ghosts appearing - seem somewhat delayed compared to those of the other children .
but this is n't accidental , radcliffe explains .
cardboard " i think it 's because ron has grown up around all this and hermione knows even more about wizards and stuff than ron does , so they instantly realise what it is , " he says .
" it just takes harry more of a moment to realise what he sees . "
since the ghosts and outlandish creatures in the film are mainly computer-generated and were added in later , radcliffe and the other children often had to react to something that was n't there .
but they were helped by cardboard cut-outs and energetic coaching from columbus .
" first he 'd just let us do it how we thought , " says radcliffe , " then he 'd help us improve on that .
he is so amazing .
he gets the balance just right . "
aspirations radcliffe , who has no siblings and goes to an all-boys school , believes he made lifelong friends during the making of the film and even got along well with his female co-star .
" i do n't mind being around girls , " he says .
" some boys my age just tease them and i just do n't get that . "
like all the cast and crew of the first harry potter film , radcliffe seems delighted that the second is already in production .
" it will be like coming back for a second year at hogwarts , " he smiles .
he hopes to continue his career as an actor and puts jude law and joseph fiennes amongst those he 'd like to emulate .
