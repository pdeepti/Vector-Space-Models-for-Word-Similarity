at 5am , the whole mad dog team met in the kitchen , slightly bleary eyed , for a quick breakfast .
by 5.45 , we were all packed up and on our way to the starting line in darwin .
we joined the other 33 cars and took our place at position 17 - a position that had been determined following our performance during yesterday 's qualifying test when we reached a top speed of 84.8 kilometres per hour -lrb- 52.6 miles per hour -rrb- .
the line-up of cars was impressive and many people turned up to support the competitors .
there was even a brass band to see us off at 8am .
nigel burgess was our first driver .
he took mad dog through darwin and out of the town .
it 's a quick changeover for the drivers once we were able to break free of the convoy , we had an exciting moment as we overtook our first car : the french helios team , who had been our neighbours in the darwin workshop .
kind act just a little further down the road , a michelin representative saw his company 's sticker on the car and stopped to hand us a few spare tyres - a spontaneous gesture of sponsorship which would certainly come in useful .
we drove all day until 5pm , through a landscape of trees , red earth and bizarre-shaped termite mounds , only stopping for the compulsory media stop of 30 minutes and the quick driver changes .
all four drivers took a turn at the wheel and we covered 515 km -lrb- 320 miles -rrb- , at an average speed of 62.4 km / h -lrb- 38.7 mph -rrb- .
we set up camp on the side of the road , in the company of a japanese car , and , once mad dog 's daily maintenance was completed , we prepared for another aussie barbie .
martine follain is a communications officer with south bank university 's mad dog team .
bbc news online will be following the progress of mad dog throughout the world solar challenge .
at the front of the field , the american pre-race favourite had a very good opening day .
m-pulse , built by a team from the university of michigan , led away from pole position having recorded a qualifying speed of 112.5 km / h -lrb- 69.9 mph -rrb- .
as the cars went through the katherine control point , m-pulse held the lead ahead of new dutch entry nuna , with aurora , a past australian winner of this event , in third position .
early reports indicated some vehicles had reached speeds of up to 130 km / h -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- .
this impressive show of speed in the first stages of the event , if maintained , would see the leaders reach adelaide inside four days .

the excitement and the packed benches which were a feature of the on-again off-again election of david trimble and mark durkan gave way to a more sober reality .
when i sat in the assembly gallery to watch part of a debate on the executive 's programme for government , only about a dozen of the 108 assembly members were bothering to attend .
the real battle over guns and government will be on 1 december .
budgets and targets are the stuff of bread and butter politics , but they do not stir the soul .
still , like the crisps ground into the sitting room carpet after your party is over , there were unmistakable memories of more boisterous times .
when women 's coalition member jane morrice suggested to the assembly speaker that he could devise some kind of recreational play activities for the legislators , lord alderdice quickly interjected that this might not be wise given the antics which stormont had so recently witnessed .
away from the stormont chamber and great hall , meetings redolent with symbolism took place .
with the cross-border ban banished , sinn fein 's bairbre de brun , the health minister , met her southern counterpart micheal martin .
the deputy first minister , mark durkan , met irish prime minister bertie ahern .
mr trimble and mr durkan met the queen , with mr durkan predicting that sinn fein would follow suit whenever a royal visit to dublin could be arranged .
meanwhile , the ulster unionists met to discuss , oh yes , the old chestnut which still will not fall off the tree , ira decommissioning .
' tougher conditions ' the unionist annual conference at the waterfront hall in belfast was - in comparison to the sdlp 's gathering - a flat , sparsely attended occasion .
perhaps that was because ulster unionist members are biding their time for a more crucial council meeting which is due to be convened on 1 december .
the council will once again debate the disarmament issue with sceptics demanding tougher conditions for unionists staying in government with sinn fein .
at the party conference , a degree of unity was achieved around the call for the new emergency laws introduced by the home secretary to deal with international terrorism to be extended to cover northern ireland 's paramilitaries .
but aside from that , the ulster unionist conference looked like two separate meetings - one of trimble loyalists , the other of the sceptical ginger group within the party .
mr trimble 's supporters say they do not fear a meeting of the 900-strong council , as the leader will enjoy an increased level of support after the start of ira decommissioning .
the sceptics ask why , if the trimble camp is not scared , have they worked so hard to prevent a council meeting , representative of the party 's grassroots , taking place ?
so the annual conference was just a warm up - the real battle over guns and government will be on 1 december .

nintendo hopes the gamecube - the company 's most powerful console to date - will fend off competition from other games hardware on the market , particularly microsoft 's xbox which launched on thursday .
the console is expected to appeal to a younger age group , so giving it a strong position in the market in the run-up to christmas .
peter main , executive vice president , sales and marketing , for nintendo of america , said he was confident the gamecube would sell .
" nintendo is the only manufacturer in the world solely dedicated to creating the world 's best interactive entertainment , " said mr main .
" and because nintendo gamecube is n't concerned with duplicating the dvd , cd player or computer you already own , we have n't had to compromise the quality of our software or the affordability of our hardware . "
age group compared with other consoles , the gamecube 's $ 199 price tag is competitive .
this makes it $ 100 less than the xbox and sony 's playstation 2 .
in terms of functionality , nintendo describes its product as an advanced luxury toy , unlike microsoft 's and sony 's all-in-one entertainment systems .
xbox and playstation 2 are both aimed at young adults while the gamecube is likely to appeal more to children aged six to 14 .
this age group has always been nintendo 's prime market , one which has made the company 's famed mario game an all-time favourite .
fifteen titles have been made available for the gamecube for its us launch , although mario will not go on sale until the summer .
the only mario-related game on sale at present is luigi 's mansion , a game featuring mario 's brother , luigi .
orders still , gamecube has been so anticipated that before launch two of its games had made the top 10 list of the most wanted games in the us .
the gamecube has been selling well online in the us and shops reported good advanced sales of the console .
trip hawkins , chief executive of video game publisher 3do co and a game industry specialist , said : " the gamecube is a very well-positioned machine that will be the ideal kids ' christmas present for the next few years . "
nintendo said it aimed to make around 1.1 million gamecubes available by the end of the year .
but some analysts expect that number to reach 1.2 million or 1.3 million as nintendo struggles to keep up with demand .
the gamecube was originally set to launch in the us on 5 november .
in september , nintendo announced it was postponing it to 18 november to ensure it had enough units available at launch .
japan despite the optimism in the us , sales of the gamecube in japan have been weaker than expected , since its launch there two months ago .
analysts blame the slowness both on the timing of the console 's launch , which came before the christmas shopping season , and the lack of a hit title .
despite its slower start in japan , many analysts see gamecube outperforming the xbox , which goes on sale in japan in february .

the pair from wales were the latest heat winners to go forward to the finals in december , joining gareth gates , 17 , zoe birkett , 16 , hayley evetts , 25 , and laura doherty , 19 .
the finalists will battle it out for a deal with 19 management - the force behind the spice girls and s club 7 - and a recording contract with rca records .
gareth gates , pop idol finalist rosie , 18 , from pontardawe , near swansea , received a huge 51.2 % share of the public vote with her rendition of bryan adams ' everything i do .
her vote was the second highest for a contestant on the itv1 show , hosted by ant and dec .
panel judge pete waterman said : " rosie 's a superstar , i told you that from the beginning .
i just think she 's fantastic . "
jessica , 20 , from kidwelly , west wales , who has appeared on michael barrymore 's my kinda people , received 12.4 % of the vote , with her version of madonna 's crazy for you .
jessica said she was delighted with her place in the final .
" this is my dream and i 'd love to take it on to the second phase , " she said .
criticised the 10,000 hopefuls who applied to pop idol were reduced to just 50 by the show 's judging panel , consisting of simon cowell head of artists and repertoire at rca records , publicist nicki chapman , capital radio dj dr fox and waterman , who helped launch kylie minogue .
the youngest competitor in this week 's group , 16-year-old ollie manson , came third with 8.8 % of the vote .
judge simon cowell was criticised by fellow panelist dj neil fox for attacking ollie 's performance of i swear as " no where near good enough " .
fox accused cowell of being over the top and claimed he had become a " caricature " and " pantomime dame " during the series .
layla manoocherhri : under age in fourth place was sandi mccash , with 8.5 % of the vote , while christopher mason came fifth with 8.3 % .
earlier this week , warwickshire schoolgirl layla manoocherhri was disqualified when it was discovered she was only 15 .
anonymous e-mails sent to the programme revealed she did not meet the 16 to 25 age requirement .
layla , who was immediately replaced , defended her decision to ignore the rules .
" all i wanted to do was show them what i could do " .
" i got there on my own merit .
the organisers are right , but it 's not that serious . "
a pop idol spokesman said : " layla and her parents knew the age limit for the competition when she applied and took a risk . "
