the parasitic ormia ochracea fly is less than one centimetre in length , but its hearing is so acute it can determine the direction of a sound within two degrees .
scientists used to think that only keen-eared owls , cats and humans possessed this special directional hearing , but the research published in nature has found the fly 's hearing is particularly good .
most flies have no sense of hearing at all but the ormia specialises in detecting singing crickets .
they deposit their tiny larvae on them and when they grow into maggots they eat the crickets from the inside out .
these flies possess one of the most accurate and efficient auditory systems in the animal kingdom which is critical to their survival professor andrew mason the fly 's ears act as an extremely small , simple and sensitive directional microphone .
now a new generation of hearing aid technology and nanoscale microscopes , based on the flies ears ' , are being developed .
directional hearing and scientists hope the new technology will help them make special directional hearing aids that are smaller and cheaper than hearing aids currently available .
this would enable the hearing impaired to tune into specific things and filter out background noise - making it easier for them to decipher what one person was saying in a crowd of people .
zoology professor andrew mason in the division of life sciences at the university of toronto and the lead author of the study said their research showed the flies had remarkable hearing .
he said : " their sense of hearing is remarkable because their ears are so close together that directional hearing would be impossible in any other animal .
" our results demonstrate that in terms of directional hearing , the flies are as good as any system known .
" these flies possess one of the most accurate and efficient auditory systems in the animal kingdom which is critical to their survival . "
to work out how the ormia fly was able to pinpoint sound , professor mason and his colleagues tethered the flies on a spherical treadmill made from a ping pong ball .
they then floated the ball on an air stream to reduce friction and to ensure the flies ' walking movements were translated into the rotations of the ball .
the scientists then used an portable speaker to play artificial cricket sounds from different parts of the room .
they found that the flies then walked towards the sound and discovered they could detect changes in a sound-source location of smaller than two degrees .
filter noise professor mason said : " even humans trying to detect who is speaking in a crowded room ca n't do better than that . "
dr john low , director of technology at the royal national institute for deaf people -lrb- rnid -rrb- , said the research would benefit the hard of hearing .
" a major problem faced by people with a hearing loss , of which there are almost nine million in the uk , is the ability to pick out individual sounds against a background of noise .
" rnid therefore welcomes any new technologies that will improve hearing aid performance in this area .
" there are many challenges in translating research into practical technologies that will benefit deaf and hard of hearing people .
" rnid is actively monitoring progress in the transfer of this research to new hearing aid development . "

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- longer-lasting hip-joint hope low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo thursday , 5 april , 2001 , 04:16 gmt 05:16 uk longer-lasting hip-joint hope using different materials could mean hip joints last longer scientists are developing new materials for artificial hips , which may prolong their life .
existing models have an average life span of 10 to 15 years , but the " ball and socket " joint wears away with use .
scientists in switzerland say this happens because the artificial hip is not lubricated in the same way as a natural one .
the team , from the swiss federal institute of technology in zurich , is now looking at whether different materials may work better .
any research designed to improve the life-time of an implant and reduce the need of further surgery is a positive step spokesman for action research most uk doctors use metal " balls " and polyethylene " sockets " .
a combination of a ceramic ball and a polyethylene socket can also be used .
about 37,000 hip replacements are carried out in the uk every year .
the operation has a failure rate of 1 % per year .
surgical materials can cost up to £ 1,000 , with the actual operation setting the health service back another £ 5,000 .
but the polyethylene socket is worn away over time .
in a natural joint , the synovial fluid which surrounds it lubricates the cartilage .
but in a joint made of polyethylene , the synovial fluid is less effective .
polyethylene properties polyethylene is hydrophobic , meaning it repels water .
lead scientist professor nicholas spencer suspected that this property could neutralise the effectiveness of the synovial fluid as a lubricant - increasing friction and wear in the hip implant .
to test his theory , he treated the polyethylene to make it more hydrophilic , or " water-loving " .
he then tested how much friction there was when a ceramic ball and a polyethylene socket were immersed in a liquid with the same properties as synovial fluid .
he found there was less friction , which would translate to less wear , than when the polyethylene was untreated .
professor spencer said : " now that we 've established that the nature of the polyethylene surface plays a role in how effectively it uses the proteins in synovial fluid as lubricants , we 're trying to find new materials that have similar mechanical properties but are a lot less hydrophobic . "
hugh phillips , consultant orthopaedic surgeon at norfolk and norwich hospital and past president of both the british orthopaedic association and the british hip society , said the research was a welcome development he told bbc news online : " the problem with polyethylene is it 's not lubricated .
" if you can alter the property of polyethylene to make it attract water , that rather mimics the natural lubrication of joints . "
a spokesman for action research , a medical research charity which helped develop the uk 's first artificial hip surgery , said : " although hip replacement surgery can drastically improve the quality of life for many patients , there is some concern about its shelf life .
" any research designed to improve the life-time of an implant and reduce the need of further surgery is a positive step . "
the charity is currently funding some leeds-based research into how artificial hips are worn away during the " swing phase " of walking , which it is hoped will highlight the benefits of different materials , and lead to recommendations to improve surgical techniques or design .
professor spencer 's research will be presented to the american chemical society .

eddie crowhurst , a former hospital doctor , tells bbc news online how the combination of a high-pressured job and little sleep led him to leave the profession he had aspired to from childhood .
he now works as a taxi driver in northampton .
dr crowhurst had always wanted to be a doctor .
" i was fascinated by human biology , from a very early age , and that eventually coalesced , and i wanted to be a doctor by the time i left school , " he said .
dr crowhurst , 32 , trained in oxford and went on to work in hospitals around east anglia .
all was well until around five years into his career when he had what he describes as " a mild nervous breakdown " .
things came to a head while he was working as a surgical senior house officer at leicester royal infirmary , though he stresses the problems could have occurred in any hospital in the nhs .
dr crowhurst said he is happier driving taxis " the long hours , in particular the phenomenally long weekends - where you start early on saturday morning and finish on monday morning - were a real problem .
" my problem was that initially when i was a house officer , i was straight out of university and i could cope with the lack of sleep .
but as i got older , i increasingly could n't - and i was taking on more responsibility . "
he said the worst times were when he was operating during a long weekend shift .
" i was conscious about making a mistake and my bleeper was going off , telling me there were more patients to see . "
" i was getting stressed , i was getting very depressed .
" i even considered jumping off the hospital car park roof . "
health problems his health deteriorated , and he began suffering coughs and colds more regularly , and even had to start using an asthma inhaler .
things came to a head around christmas 1997 .
dr crowhurst had been away , and was preparing to return to work for his first on-call shift .
as he was leaving , he was struck by a severe coughing fit .
deciding it would be impossible if he was affected in the same way while operating , he decided to call in sick .
but he says his bosses were " very unsympathetic " .
dr crowhurst says he knows his anxiety and his sleep-deprivation probably affected his " bedside manner " and the way he dealt with patients .
his bosses suggested he see a psychiatrist - something dr crowhurst welcomed as a chance to sort his problems out .
but he says the aim of the consultation was simply to pass him as fit to begin going on call again .
he was coming towards the end of his six-month training stint at the hospital , and he says once that period had come to an end , he would have been another hospital 's problem .
dr crowhurst took a medical research post , but when that finished in the summer of 2000 , he found work as a taxi driver .
" i asked a friend who ran a cab service if i could drive for him .
" i enjoy being self-employed and being in control . "
he said he still did some occupational health work , but did not envisage going back into hospital medicine .
and dr crowhurst said the only comments he tends to get from passengers is to ask him why he 's wearing a bow tie .
although he is happy in the choice he has made , dr crowhurst says having a service such as neurolink could have helped .
" if there had been something like that around while i was practising , i might well have been able to manage things and stay in the job . "

finance minister edwina hart revealed on thursday that the project is ready to go to tender - and that the assembly will be looking for a fixed price contract for the building work .
our communities , our creative industry in wales and also our country 's international profile will benefit from this cultural development welsh finance minister jenny randerson " we are laying the foundations for a cultural centre which will not only enable creativity in wales to flourish but will also promote the welsh culture and the welsh success story to the rest of europe and beyond , " she said .
in recent months , assembly members have seen the bill for constructing the centre soar from £ 75m to £ 92m .
after the initial surprise , they are now ready to see if a company can build it for within that budget - with guarantees attached .
the appointment of sir david rowe beddoe as the new chairman of the wmc helped quell fears .
" as public funds are involved we have a responsibility to ensure that the wales millennium centre is delivered at an acceptable cost ... , " said ms randerson .
" but let 's not forget this is good news for wales and the advantages the wales millennium centre can offer will be far reaching .
" our communities , our creative industry in wales and also our country 's international profile will benefit from this cultural development . "
some questions do remain , however , such as the year-on-year funding of the centre with the business plan , which is seen by some as unrealistic .
issues like this are due to be scrutinised in may when the project goes before the assembly 's culture committee .
and last week , theatre managers in wales wrote to the assembly to voice concerns about the viability of a proposed new showcase for the arts .
creu cymru - an umbrella group representing 31 theatre venues in wales - lobbied the assembly , spelling out its concerns that the centre would damage other venues .
the wales millennium centre project has been dogged by delays and rows over funding for several years .
back in december , the project 's backers presented new proposals to the assembly aimed to help allay fears about its feasibility .
core features - including the dramatic slate and steel cladding of the building and the space allocated to the lyric theatre - remained unchanged .
but cost savings were made by changing the internal layout and reducing the height and complexity of the design .
work was due to start this spring , but assembly first minister rhodri morgan insisted money would not be released until he is satisfied with the centre 's business plan .
back in november it emerged that cardiff bay developers grosvenor waterside had made contingency plans to sell the 4.7-acre site if building work had not started within 12 months .

the european parliament has very little power to influence the foreign policies of the european union 's member governments , but it does provide an important forum for debate .

it had , she said , banished itself from the civilized international community .
so mrs fontaine and her fellow european parliamentarians will be keen to learn from mr masood how the world community might assist in efforts to oppose the taleban .
but the taleban itself has complained that european support for mr masood will merely prolong afghanistan 's civil war .
it has certainly been a significant boost to opposition morale that might also persuade the taleban of the need to do more to extinguish this source of annoyance to their regime .
