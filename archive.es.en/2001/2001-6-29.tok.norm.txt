with a round of base closings ... we could focus funds on facilities we actually need us defence secretary donald rumsfeld mr rumsfeld told congress that defence spending in 2002 would have to increase by about 5 % to keep the department running with no improvements - and the savings to be made by the proposed cuts were needed for future development .
he said the closures were needed as part of an overall military review to reduce overcapacity , and save the money needed to transform the armed forces .
the proposed 2002 budget of $ 329bn represents the biggest boost the us defence department has seen since the mid-1980s .
appearing before the house armed services committee , mr rumsfeld also proposed reducing the air force bomber fleet and scrapping all 50 peacemaker long-range nuclear missiles .
overcapacity mr rumsfeld focused on the planned base closures and referred to recent studies showing that the us has 20-25 % overcapacity in terms of its military bases .
the scheme received support from the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , general henry shelton .
" by removing that excess capacity we could potentially save an estimated $ 3bn per year , which is money which could be used to fix the remaining infrastructure , " he said .
others were more sceptical .
republican representative joel hefley spoke of his " serious concern " over the plans , which he said would cause anxiety over job cuts among military communities .
other republicans said the figures did not bear out the projected savings .
" i 'm disappointed by the overall content of this budget , given the extreme delays in producing it , " republican ike skelton of missouri said .
on the equipment front , mr rumsfeld delivered a clear indication as to the direction in which the bush administration planned to go .
i 'm disappointed by the overall content of this budget , given the extreme delays in producing it republican ike skelton of missouri he outlined funding rises for missile defence , and further spending on the global hawk unmanned reconnaissance aircraft .
mr rumsfeld also asked congress for permission to begin scrapping all 50 multiple-warhead mx ballistic missiles , which he said were simply " not needed " .
some lawmakers questioned his long-range plans for missile defence and other priorities .
several democrats on the house armed services committee asked why the budget did not reflect any of the findings for an ongoing top-to-bottom defence review designed to modernise the military .
' people the priority ' the bbc 's jonathan marcus says that while much of the talk has been about hardware - the application of new technologies or major programmes under threat - the real priority in this budget is people .
he said mr rumsfeld realises there is no point setting about fundamental reformation of the military if some of its best personnel are leaving for more comfortable jobs in the civilian world .
he has proposed a significant increase in spending upon military health care , especially for older retired personnel .
pay rises are also in the pipeline , and money is to be spent on improving living conditions .

i do not want to kill people with our recommendations and it is conceivable we could do that panelist kenrad nelson the us food and drug administration recommended that no-one who had spent three months or more in britain or five years in other european countries in the 1980s and 1990s should be able to give blood .
the committee 's recommendations are set to be implemented as soon as possible .
doctors in new york are warning of severe shortages and even of hospitals having to close .
a spokeswoman for the advisory committee said it was intended that within a year all the restrictions would be fully implemented - but that steps would also have been taken to recruit more donors to replace the lost blood supplies .
countless lives will be lost if blood supplies are cut further .
we already are dealing with a dwindling supply panelist dr jeffrey doughlin the american red cross - which collects half of the us blood supply - was pushing for even stronger restrictions .
but other medical institutions argued that there must be more of a balance between ensuring the safety of the blood supply and the safety of patients who need blood during operations or transfusions .
there is no scientific proof that bse - or mad cow disease - is transmitted by blood .
the new regulations will hit new york city hardest .
the city currently has to import a quarter of the 2,000 pints of blood it needs every day from europe and it can not find enough donors .
