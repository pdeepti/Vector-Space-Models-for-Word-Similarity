only two other countries - pakistan and saudi arabia - still recognise the taleban , who control most of afghanistan .
a uae foreign ministry statement quoted by the official news agency wam said the gulf state had taken the decision after failing to persuade the taleban to hand over saudi-born militant osama bin laden .
the united states says bin laden and his associates are the main suspects in the devastating suicide attacks on washington and new york .
suspects several saudi citizens and one emirati have been named among the suspects for the 11 september suicide attacks on the world trade center and pentagon , which left more than 6,000 people missing and presumed dead .
saudi arabia downgraded ties with kabul to charge d 'affaires level in 1998 in protest at the taleban 's refusal to hand over bin laden following attacks on us embassies in kenya and tanzania .
a uae foreign ministry official said the emirati authorities " have made intense efforts to persuade the taleban to give a favourable answer to the -lrb- un -rrb- security council request to hand over bin laden , so that he can be given a fair trial by an international court on the charges linked to the terrorist attacks " .
the official added that the uae " does not believe it is possible to continue to maintain diplomatic relations with a government that refuses to respond to the clear will of the international community " .
the uae has complied with un sanctions imposed on the taleban at the end of 2000 for failing to hand over bin laden .
the uae , where some 110,000 afghans live , halted an air link between dubai and the afghan capital kabul last november as the sanctions went into effect .
the uae , saudi arabia and other gulf states have stated their readiness to " co-operate fully " with the united states in the campaign against international terrorism .
the six member states of the gulf co-operation council are to meet in the saudi capital riyadh on sunday and are expected to present a united front .

it was an emotional performance and springsteen 's reverential lyrics managed to focus appropriate attention on the victims of last week 's terrorist attacks .
the subdued two-hour america : a tribute to heroes broadcast , which was produced in los angeles and new york , ran without interruption by commercials , and for the most part , did not lapse into hollywood sentimentality .
we are merely artists , entertainers , here to raise spirits and we hope , a great deal of money bruce springsteen stevie wonder , sting , celine dion , mariah carey , neil young , billy joel and sting were among 20 different musicians who performed .
whether it was paul simon singing bridge over troubled water while wearing a new york fire department cap or wyclef jean sporting the american flag while doing a version of bob marley 's redemption song , it all added up to a very powerful evening .
one of the most anticipated performances came from mariah carey , who recently suffered a breakdown , but her rendition of the song hero was not among the stand-out moments .
brief tributes after the horror of recent days the music acts that resonated for new yorkers seemed to be billy joel crooning a new york state of mind , or neil young 's version of john lennon 's imagine .
the musical contributions were interspersed by brief tributes from a roster of big name actors and singers who detailed the heroic efforts of firefighters , police officers and other individuals affected by the disaster .

intense experience after springsteen performed he told viewers : " we are not the protectors of this great nation " .

for rice , a special moment in the telethon occurred when sting , performing fragile live from london , dedicated the song to his brother 's boss herman sandler , who also died in the world trade center carnage .
the relatives hope the broadcast was effective as a fundraising effort , and many thought the presence of having major celebrities , including jack nicholson and sylvester stallone , working phone banks was a good tactic that would encourage people to call in .
anti-muslim discrimination the broadcast also included clips of muslim schoolchildren in the us describing how they had already become targets of hatred .
in an effort to combat discrimination against muslims , will smith appeared with muhammad ali , who he plays in a forthcoming biopic .
ali , america 's most famous muslim , said : " i would n't be here representing islam if it were terrorist . "
the telethon was not an overtly political event , but it was boldly patriotic and it fell to hollywood veteran clint eastwood to remind the rest of the world of american resolve .
eastwood told viewers : " in the conflict that 's come upon us we 're determined to win through the ultimate triumph , so help us god . "
meaningful tribute the broadcast succeeded because it was understated and not manic or flashy , in fact several celebrities stumbled over their lines and the ensemble musical finale was unco-ordinated .
this lack of hollywood gloss made it a far more authentic and meaningful tribute .
it will be a few days yet before it is known how much money the telethon has raised for the united way 's september 11 fund .
but it could end up being one of most successful attempts ever to harness the power of pop culture to generate money for the victims of a disaster .
the fund will use the money to " respond to the pressing needs of the victims and their families and all those affected by the tragedy " .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- verdict due in libyan hiv trial categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : middle east front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 22 september , 2001 , 08:51 gmt 09:51 uk verdict due in libyan hiv trial gaddafi says foreign intelligence forces are to blame a libyan court is due to announce its verdicts in the trial of six bulgarian health workers and a palestinian doctor , charged with deliberately infecting hundreds of libyan children with the virus that causes aids .
libyan prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for the workers , who are accused of injecting 393 children with hiv-contaminated blood .
the indictment said the infection was part of a conspiracy by foreign intelligence forces to undermine libyan security and its role in the arab world .
there have been serious irregularities in ... pre-trial proceedings amnesty international all the defendants pleaded not guilty .
the trial has provoked strong feelings in bulgaria after two of the defendants alleged they had been tortured and made confessions under duress .
it has also raised concern among human rights groups who have complained about reports that hiv-contaminated plasma was discovered at a defendant 's apartment while she was in police custody , and the refusal of the court to allow expert opinion from switzerland and france .
amnesty international has said " there have been serious irregularities in ... pre-trial proceedings " .
bad practices bulgaria has accused libya of holding a political trial and has repeatedly called for an independent team of international experts to study the case and testify .
luc perrin , head of virology at geneva university hospital , said the contamination was caused by " bad medical practices . "
perrin , who examined 40 of the children , said at least half were also infected with hepatitis c , which suggests the hospital had reused needles .
the court has refused to allow perrin to testify .
libyan leader muammar gaddafi has said the cia or mossad , israel 's intelligence agency , were behind the childrens ' illnesses .
he has blamed other crises on the united states and israel , both of which accuse libya of supporting terrorism .
besides the murder and conspiracy counts , the bulgarians are charged with drinking in public - alcohol is banned in libya - and engaging in extramarital sex .
nine libyans charged in the same case are out on bail .
othman el-bezanti , the lawyer defending the bulgarians , said that if they are found guilty , they have two stages of appeal .

secretary of state john reid suspended the political institutions at midnight on friday , for a period expected to be no longer than 24 hours , in an effort to buy more time to break the deadlock .
the move has created another six-week window for the parties to try to reach agreement over the issues of ira decommissioning , british army demilitarisation and ensuring the stability of the institutions .
it is the second time the british government has used this device to prevent the collapse of the power-sharing administration in northern ireland .
dr reid ordered a similar temporary suspension on 11 august .
the six-week window that had created was due to expire at midnight on saturday .
outstanding issues dr reid said there was now an opportunity for paramilitaries " to take the step which will enable the issue to be resolved once and for all " .
" when i restored the institutions on 11 august my hope was that early progress would be possible to secure the full implementation of all the outstanding issues under the good friday agreement , " he said .
" in the past six weeks , however , circumstances have changed . "
he said the deadlock on policing had been resolved , the ira had announced that it was intensifying engagement with the arms body and the tragic events in the united states had overshadowed everything over the past two weeks .
david trimble : " no point in suspension if ira will not then move on arms " " they have brought into starker focus than ever before the choice that has to be made between democracy and terror - a choice which leaves no room for ambiguity , " said dr reid .
ulster unionist leader david trimble is expected to consult with party colleagues on saturday as they consider their options in the wake of the suspension move .
the uup would have prefered an unlimited suspension rather than a temporary break .
hardliners within the party want mr trimble to withdraw his ministers from the power-sharing executive , but mr trimble has indicated he will consult widely before making any decision .
sinn fein president gerry adams has condemned the suspension .
he said : " once again , the british government has stepped outside the good friday agreement in a bid to satisfy insatiable unionist demands . "
northern ireland finance minister mark durkan , of the sdlp , said suspension was " a regrettable but necessary device " .
" the alternatives to it would mean that the day after the executive agreed a draft programme for government and a draft budget to be put before the assembly next week , those institutions which were working effectively in the public interest would have been stood down , " he said .
irish minister for foreign affairs brian cowen said : " it is disappointing that we should , once again , find ourselves in this situation .
" however , i understand that the secretary of state has taken this difficult decision to provide us with extra time in which to build on the progress made in recent weeks . "
' unionist demands ' the dup said the institutions were " steadily losing credibility " .
assembly member ian paisley junior said the suspension was " only delaying their demise " .
david trimble precipitated the current crisis with his resignation as northern ireland first minister on 1 july because of the ira 's refusal to disarm .
the suspension came after the ira said on thursday that it would intensify its contacts with the international decommissioning body .

eugene krushchev to watch coverage of the forum , select the link below : 56k as the prospect of military retaliation for the attacks on the united states looms closer , all eyes are focused on afghanistan .
the us and her allies are expected to target the country if the ruling taleban fail to hand over the main suspect , osama bin laden .
but afghanistan is a notoriously difficult country for military assaults , as the british and russians have previously learnt to their cost .
it is a rugged , inhospitable country , with mountainous terrain severely hampering communication links .
what challenges would ground forces face ?
how difficult is the terrain ?
and how much of a challenge is a military assault on the country likely to prove ?
eugene krushchev , deputy chairman of the russian afghan war veterans union , joined us for a forum on thursday .
transcript of highlights newshost : welcome to this bbc news online forum on the aftermath of the attacks on the united states .
the prime suspect osama bin laden is believed to be hiding in afghanistan and it is widely believed that the us and her allies are preparing military action to find him .
well joining me now from moscow is eugene krushchev a former red army soldier an a veteran of the russian army 's ill fated war in afghanistan which ended of course in defeat for the russian forces .
can we start first of all with a question from vichali churyan from berkeley in the united states , do you believe russia and the rest of the cif states in the region should support or even get involved in any american led operation against afghanistan .
eugene krushchev : i have to split this question into two subdivisions first answering the second part we are already involved , it is a de facto , it is a fait acompli , there is nothing to talk about .
that is the first , the second point is that we have to be more emphatic about our support for an international drive to fight terrorism .
but fighting for real , not just to pay lip service .
we have to , we have to set up a universal internationally accepted approach .
newshost : another question now from the united states , this one from dan webb from ann arbour .
what were the most critical factors that led to the soviet failure in afghanistan .
eugene krushchev : the most critical failure it was a half hearted attempt to begin with , it was a slow slippage from good intention to , to disastrous results , both for the afghan population to disenchantment of our troops and in a way i would say it was a kremlin betrayal .
us russian veterans we believe that gorbachov betrayed our allies in kabul in afghanistan , our own troops .
we had the resolve to stay there but if politicians betray you and your allies what you can do ?
we are the military , we get the job done , we are not discussing the orders .
we got the order to pull out and we just did it .
if we were ordered to stay and continue we would , we would do whatever we were told to , just like any professional army for that matter .
newshost : so it really is about the political will to go in and do it .
eugene krushchev : exactly .
i highly admired president bush senior when he solicited us congress support before the persian gulf war .
at that time i was in new york city and he was very explicit about getting one hundred percent support of the whole political spectrum of the united states as well as getting support of the american nation as a whole .
we completely missed that altogether .
the second factor which compounded the soviet failure in afghanistan was that it was a proxy fight between the soviet union and the united states using our proxy pseudo freedom fighters .
newshost : a couple of questions now on the practicalities of managing an operation in afghanistan .
duncan keene in london wants to know would your advice be to go for a ground assault or more use of specialist forces and weapons .
eugene krushchev : i would rephrase this question , i would say we have to do our best to keep our ground forces at bay from their ground contact in afghanistan 's harsh , harsh and highly unfriendly environment for a couple of reasons .
first of all it is still , peppered with the mine fields which have been piling up for more than two decades .
i suggest that the decision will be made to minimise us third infantry division exposure to their ground enemy fire , sparing their tanks and bradley vehicles from being the fat and juicy targets for the chief rpg .
i would strongly suggest that it has to be completely within the domain and responsibility of special forces and low intensity conflict command .
it has to be exclusively a special forces operation , exclusively with the necessary air force , tactical support and high tech communication and intelligence capabilities .
newshost : well that leads on to the next question from yousef nasef in cairo , egypt will air attacks be of any use .
eugene krushchev : only for the preliminary stage .
it could not be substitution for the special operations major cleansing job .
the tactical air force component has to destroy all fixed installation .
newshost : another question now from shrieda rasheram in campul india who wants to know if the taleban take refuge in their mountain hide-outs what strategy should the americans follow to smoke them out as mr bush has put it .
eugene krushchev : well this is where americans can activate their experience of carpet bombing techniques from vietnam relying mostly on napalm .
this is especially effective in the mountains and you do n't have to use defoliants .
so it is not as hazardous for the environment like whatever they did in the jungle guerrilla warfare .
first napalm , second it is the vacuum bombs which we used in afghanistan and the third , the third it is , it is an old ancient but it is still reliable and highly effective .
they have to use the human intelligence component , relying on their pakistani allies and their intelligence sources in the north alliance .
newshost : question from nicholas chebdar in new york .
he wants to know do you believe the taleban could sustain a military operation against america without another country providing arms to them and would they be able to replenish what weapons they lose or use .
eugene krushchev : this is where i can not express too much optimism talking about that .
you can not blockage them if you , if the economic blockage failed against iraq how are you going to get an effective seal of the taleban movement in such a rugged terrain .
i do n't think you can effectively seal them off .
temporarily from one bombing attack and another they will try to sneak through .
newshost : ok eugene we are nearly out of time but let me just ask you this one final question , it is really a very personal question from samah in the uk who wants to know would you personally go back to afghanistan .
eugene krushchev : i will if my commanding chief will say so and i will gladly do so with american special forces partners as soon as i get my orders .

i would strongly suggest that it has to be completely within the domain and responsibility of special forces and low intensity conflict command .
it has to be exclusively a special forces operation , exclusively with the necessary air force , tactical support and high tech communication and intelligence capabilities .
newshost : well that leads on to the next question from yousef nasef in cairo , egypt will air attacks be of any use .
eugene krushchev : only for the preliminary stage .
it could not be substitution for the special operations major cleansing job .
the tactical air force component has to destroy all fixed installation .
newshost : another question now from shrieda rasheram in campul india who wants to know if the taleban take refuge in their mountain hide-outs what strategy should the americans follow to smoke them out as mr bush has put it .
eugene krushchev : well this is where americans can activate their experience of carpet bombing techniques from vietnam relying mostly on napalm .
this is especially effective in the mountains and you do n't have to use defoliants .
so it is not as hazardous for the environment like whatever they did in the jungle guerrilla warfare .
first napalm , second it is the vacuum bombs which we used in afghanistan and the third , the third it is , it is an old ancient but it is still reliable and highly effective .
they have to use the human intelligence component , relying on their pakistani allies and their intelligence sources in the north alliance .
newshost : question from nicholas chebdar in new york .
he wants to know do you believe the taleban could sustain a military operation against america without another country providing arms to them and would they be able to replenish what weapons they lose or use .
eugene krushchev : this is where i can not express too much optimism talking about that .
you can not blockage them if you , if the economic blockage failed against iraq how are you going to get an effective seal of the taleban movement in such a rugged terrain .
i do n't think you can effectively seal them off .
temporarily from one bombing attack and another they will try to sneak through .
newshost : ok eugene we are nearly out of time but let me just ask you this one final question , it is really a very personal question from samah in the uk who wants to know would you personally go back to afghanistan .
eugene krushchev : i will if my commanding chief will say so and i will gladly do so with american special forces partners as soon as i get my orders .

bbc news -pipe- forum -pipe- oxfam 's alex renton on afghan refugees categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : talking point : forum front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 22 september , 2001 , 10:59 gmt 11:59 uk oxfam 's alex renton on afghan refugees to watch coverage of the forum , select the link below : 56k more than one million afghans have fled their homes , driven out by food shortages and fear of us attacks .
the united nations says that at least 15,000 refugees have entered pakistan in the last week , despite attempts to close the border .
food supplies have been suspended , international aid workers withdrawn and winter on the way , relief agencies say millions face starvation .
what is the situation on the borders in afghanistan ?
are supplies getting through ?
alex renton is oxfam 's crisis co-ordinator for afghanistan and pakistan .
he joined us for a live forum and answered a selection of your questions .
transcript of highlights susannah price : hello and welcome to islamabad , i 'm susannah price , today we 'll be discussing the humanitarian crisis in afghanistan , a country already wracked by the worst drought in living memory and now facing the threat of american attacks .
well i 'm joined to discuss this by the spokesman for the aid agency oxfam , alex renton and i 'll be reading your e-mails .
alex first of all we have an e-mail from martin bray in glasgow , he says : i see it 's absolutely essential that aid gets to pakistan first of all very rapidly preferably within days and in large quantities .
how can it be done and if so when ?
alex renton : well the problem is n't getting aid to pakistan , i mean that 's needed because we 're seeing a massive influx of refugees across this border .
the thing that is worrying us more though is the people needing aid in afghanistan itself - there are three million people in afghanistan who are receiving food aid from oxfam who are distributing world food programme supplies and those supplies stopped on september 11th .
and those people face in a very few weeks , starvation .
susannah price : renate from london asks how can we help other than with money , is there a way of sending in food via oxfam ?
alex renton : i 'm afraid it 's not practical renate to send in food , money is the simplest and cheapest way , we try very hard to keep administration costs as low as possible .
and honestly what we 're delivering chiefly is corn and rice in afghanistan , when we get the chance to and we can buy that here far cheaper than you can buy it in london .
so it 's cost effective to send us money .
susannah price : well , following on from that hannah beadman in los angeles wants to know that if she gives aid to help organisations in afghanistan or in pakistan , how do we really know it 's getting through to the innocent women and children ?
alex renton : it would be hard to describe any of the people we 're seeing as anything other than innocent .
they are victims of twenty years of war , a war first begun by russia in 1979 .
they are the victims of a natural disaster which is appalling drought which has gripped at least half the country for the last three / four years , and they 're now the victims of a threat which is way outside their understanding .
they 're the victims of an open threat of retaliation - a rumour has spread across afghanistan that the allies lead by america intend to avenge the killings in america on afghanistan , this means they all believe they are targets .
now this is obviously untrue , it 's obviously not what george bush or tony blair want , but fear has spread across this , this tragic country and it 's meant that we have had to stop supplying food to these innocent people .
we ca n't do it any longer because of the security situation , because truck drivers in afghanistan are too frightened to drive the trucks up into the hills .
i also should point out that many of the people , the poor people that we 're giving food aid to , the poor people who are fleeing for the frontiers here are not supporters of the taleban .
if they have the chance to think about politics at all they , many of them are coming from the northern part of the country which is opposed to the taleban and which has been fighting a civil war against them , for , for a similar amount of time .
so , i ca n't sit here and make a promise to you that i will , we will provide no food to a supporter of the taleban .
what i can promise is that of the two million people that we see as being in need over the next couple of months , every one of them will need that food and that not a single one of them is in a position to make any choices about how they live their lives .
susannah price : well there 's a more political question now from amsterdam , saying : during the past years ngos have been actively protesting against globalisation - wto , imf and us farm policy .
in some cases such as seattle they 've been able to raise their voices enough to be taken into account when decisions are taken .
why are n't they reacting more strongly in the light of these current events ?
alex renton : that 's a very interesting question .
i mean the history of oxfam and politics is a difficult one , i , you may not be aware that in britain the charity laws prevent political activity by charities , otherwise you loose your status and all the necessary tax breaks that you get with it .
on the other hand we do increasingly indulge in global campaigning and we were part of the drop the debt campaign , we spend a lot of time and energy lobbying the world trade organisation and the imf and world bank .
because we see that tackling them , is the only real way of tackling the root causes of poverty .
we work in the fields , we build schools and help in hospitals and help educate people , but in the end we have to sort out the global , the global pressures that make countries poor .
so we do do that sort of work and we 're going to do it more and more i think .
here , it , it 's difficult again , the politics are extremely complicated , we risk our own staff 's lives sometimes if we dabble too much .
we have a hundred and forty staff , afghanis , who are in afghanistan still trying to do work .
we , we do not want to put them , make them more insecure than they already are .
but on the other hand we have been political today if you like , we delivered a letter to tony blair as a member of the alliance against terrorism , asking that he represent to george bush and the other countries involved the problem here , and state very clearly that unless the fear is lifted off the ordinary people of afghanistan , a humanitarian crisis of really quite catastrophic proportions is on its way .
so we 've asked that that a political decision be made , that it 's just simply spelt out that the ordinary people of afghanistan are not targets in this war against terrorism .
otherwise we are going to see - some people are calling it kosovo x 5 , the figures are unimaginable , two million people already on the move perhaps within afghanistan , a hundred and seventy thousand on the borders with afghanistan , up in these mountains that you can see behind me .
and as winter approaches , the three million we were feeding before are all facing starvation .
susannah price : well an interesting question now about what the taleban 's actually doing - d mcdonald from edinburgh in scotland says , is there any aid infrastructure or effort undertaken by the taleban aimed at providing food et cetera for those that need it which could be disrupted by military action ?
alex renton : i mean the taleban rule a part of afghanistan as any government rules it in some ways , i mean they operate a civil society , they operate hospitals and indeed islam is a religion which has always prided itself and part of its work is the caring for the poor .
and certainly our oxfam staff in those parts of afghanistan where the taleban operate have to work alongside the government in helping distribute food .
so , yes certainly their own humanitarian efforts will be damaged or in fact have stopped already , because all humanitarian effort has stopped at the moment .
susannah price : james from auckland new zealand wants to know if the refugees arriving at the pakistani border really know what they 're fleeing from and do they support the thinking of the taleban ?
alex renton : no , i mean if you go up to the border you will be appalled , you would find - these are people who as i said earlier have , have suffered twenty years of war .
if you asked an ordinary afghan farmer what was going on i 'm sure he has no idea at all .
i mean you 're talking about a country that is obviously among the poorest in the world , a place where twenty-five percent of children die before they 're aged five .
a place where someone said to one of our workers the other day , if this food stops this village will die , this winter .
global politics are certainly not part of most of these people 's daily existence .
their daily existence is about trying to find a way to exist .
but again as i said a little earlier , a large proportion of these people , the refugees we 're seeing now , have come from areas which are not taleban controlled and are controlled by the opposition .
susannah price : and briefly ruth burnett from bangkok in thailand has asked : is it true that a humanitarian crisis already exists in afghanistan and is about to reach panic levels , a tidal wave of refugees to neighbouring countries may be taking place , but what about those who have been left behind ?
alex renton : ruth , you raise a very good point .
we 're seeing - over a hundred thousand people already crossing this border .
but the view is that up to two million people could already be on the move , looking for food sources because they 're aware that the food deliveries they were getting , there 's three million who were getting them , are already drying out .
now these people are people i should stress are primarily looking for food , they 're not fleeing fear of attack .
we 've seen the cities empty because of fear of attack , but there 's a great rural population which is just worrying about how to feed themselves as winter comes .

otherwise we are going to see - some people are calling it kosovo x 5 , the figures are unimaginable , two million people already on the move perhaps within afghanistan , a hundred and seventy thousand on the borders with afghanistan , up in these mountains that you can see behind me .
and as winter approaches , the three million we were feeding before are all facing starvation .
susannah price : well an interesting question now about what the taleban 's actually doing - d mcdonald from edinburgh in scotland says , is there any aid infrastructure or effort undertaken by the taleban aimed at providing food et cetera for those that need it which could be disrupted by military action ?
alex renton : i mean the taleban rule a part of afghanistan as any government rules it in some ways , i mean they operate a civil society , they operate hospitals and indeed islam is a religion which has always prided itself and part of its work is the caring for the poor .
and certainly our oxfam staff in those parts of afghanistan where the taleban operate have to work alongside the government in helping distribute food .
so , yes certainly their own humanitarian efforts will be damaged or in fact have stopped already , because all humanitarian effort has stopped at the moment .
susannah price : james from auckland new zealand wants to know if the refugees arriving at the pakistani border really know what they 're fleeing from and do they support the thinking of the taleban ?
alex renton : no , i mean if you go up to the border you will be appalled , you would find - these are people who as i said earlier have , have suffered twenty years of war .
if you asked an ordinary afghan farmer what was going on i 'm sure he has no idea at all .
i mean you 're talking about a country that is obviously among the poorest in the world , a place where twenty-five percent of children die before they 're aged five .
a place where someone said to one of our workers the other day , if this food stops this village will die , this winter .
global politics are certainly not part of most of these people 's daily existence .
their daily existence is about trying to find a way to exist .
but again as i said a little earlier , a large proportion of these people , the refugees we 're seeing now , have come from areas which are not taleban controlled and are controlled by the opposition .
susannah price : and briefly ruth burnett from bangkok in thailand has asked : is it true that a humanitarian crisis already exists in afghanistan and is about to reach panic levels , a tidal wave of refugees to neighbouring countries may be taking place , but what about those who have been left behind ?
alex renton : ruth , you raise a very good point .
we 're seeing - over a hundred thousand people already crossing this border .
but the view is that up to two million people could already be on the move , looking for food sources because they 're aware that the food deliveries they were getting , there 's three million who were getting them , are already drying out .
now these people are people i should stress are primarily looking for food , they 're not fleeing fear of attack .
we 've seen the cities empty because of fear of attack , but there 's a great rural population which is just worrying about how to feed themselves as winter comes .

her movements were restricted after she attempted to travel outside the capital .
senior members of her party , the national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- , were also detained .
the nld won elections held in 1990 , but the military never allowed it to govern .
talks aung san suu kyi is no stranger to confinement .
she was originally put under house arrest in 1989 and spent six years there .
but this time it has been different .
the country 's military rulers have begun to talk to her .
she is not actually meeting the senior generals , an nld spokesman told the bbc , but there is regular contact between the two sides .
the talks are being held in secret and no one knows what is actually being discussed .
diplomats in rangoon say the talks are still at a confidence-building stage .
since the dialogue process began , more than 200 political prisoners , including two senior nld leaders , have been freed .
human rights groups say there are more than 1,500 political prisoners in burma 's jails .
the nld spokesman told the bbc that all political prisoners had to be released if the talks were to move beyond this initial trust-building stage .
meetings many critics believe the burmese generals are not serious about political change , and have only entered the dialogue process in an effort to deflect international criticism and in the hope that it might also lessen their international isolation .
in the past year aung san suu kyi has been allowed to meet senior members of her party , senior diplomats and un officials .
a burmese government spokesman says aung san suu kyi is under voluntary confinement , but that is not how the nld spokesman sees it .
he told the bbc that aung san suu kyi wanted all restrictions on her movement lifted immediately , including being able to travel outside rangoon .
only then , say diplomats , will the dialogue process actually be making real progress .

it was feared airlines would be forced to ground planes after a massive hike in insurance premiums following the atrocities in the us .
but the government stepped into the breach after insurers gave the airlines seven days ' notice that they were cancelling war liability cover from midnight on monday .
there is no generalised subsidy to airlines - that would be impossible anyway under european state aid rules gordon brown now eu finance ministers meeting in belgium hope to draw up guiding principles for a system under which governments across the union would underwrite the insurance of aeroplanes against acts of war or terrorism .
insurers will continue insuring the aircraft and their passengers and crew , but limit their liability for damage caused on the ground in the case of a crash to $ 50m -lrb- £ 34m -rrb- .
aeroplane owners , who lease the craft to airlines , normally demand third party insurance cover of around $ 750m -lrb- £ 515m -rrb- .
financial difficulties in an arrangement with the london insurance market , from next monday the government will provide a further indemnity for third-party war and terrorism liabilities .
the indemnity will be offered free of charge by the government for 30 days because of the financial difficulties currently being faced by the airline industry .
but following that period , the government will charge for the service at commercial rates in the same way as the " pool re " system of insuring buildings against terrorist attack introduced in 1993 following a wave of ira bombings in the city .
mr brown told bbc radio 4 's today programme there could be no bailout of ailing airlines .
he said : " over the last 20 years , europe has spent a lot of time eliminating the possibility of state subsidies for airlines .
european rules " this is , and should be , a highly competitive business .
" but there are specific things where it is clearly the government 's responsibility , and i thought it right , with -lrb- trade secretary -rrb- stephen byers , to step in on this issue of insurance .
" there is no generalised subsidy to airlines .
that would be impossible anyway under european state aid rules . "
mr brown refused to say whether airlines and airports could be given grants to improve security , while admitting the state clearly had responsibilities in the area .
the us government 's airline rescue package includes $ 5bn in direct grants and loan guarantees of $ 10bn .

the system , developed by qinetiq , is designed to pick up suspicious passengers before they board planes , by checking passport details against a database of suspects .
it could also be used to spot people using fake passports , passengers with a history of air rage , and criminals wanted by the police .
the british airline pilots ' association -lrb- balpa -rrb- believes this will be more effective than introducing new security measures on board planes , such as armed guards or extra cockpit security .
this system could give us the ability to stop potential terrorists from boarding our aircraft capt ian hibberd balpa 's security committee chairman , captain ian hibberd , told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " it has always been our belief that although such things might have a part to play in the final solution , the focus must be on stopping terrorists and preventing disruptive passengers from boarding our aircraft in the first place .
" we believe this system could give us the ability to stop potential terrorists from boarding our aircraft . "
faster check-in capt hibberd said airlines could feed information on potentially disruptive passengers and people who use fraudulent tickets into a central database .
the home office could also supply information on false passports and people wanted by the police or customs and excise , he said .
" one of the aspects of this is something called border guard , developed by imaging automation .
when that is added to the qinetiq database , it will actually validate the passport as soon as it is read . "
capt hibberd said the system would make it " very unlikely " that anyone with a false passport would make it on to a plane .
faster security checks would also benefit ordinary passengers , he added .
" they will be able to check in , in a far quicker way than they do at the moment , because it will be automated and their name will be run against the database . "
the system could be adapted to target different types of passenger in the future and would not leave taxpayers with a hefty bill , said capt hibberd .
" we believe it will be self-financing within a couple of years . "
new scanner qinetiq , the public-private partnership which took on much of the work of the defence evaluation and research agency , has also developed a scanner to detect objects missed by metal detectors .
the scanner picks out a ceramic knife hidden under this newspaper the millimetre wave camera would find weapons like the ceramic knives believed to have been used by some of the hijackers involved in the terror attacks on america .
it works by detecting naturally occurring radiation as it reflects off different objects .
knives or guns hidden in clothing or baggage appear on the scanner 's display as distinct illuminated shapes .

secretary of state john reid has told the bbc he intends to reinstate the institutions by midnight , but said this would be the last short suspension .
the move has created another six weeks for the parties to try to reach agreement over the issues of ira decommissioning , british army demilitarisation and ensuring the stability of the institutions .
it is the third time the british government has suspended stormont in two years to prevent the collapse of the power-sharing administration .
dr reid ordered a similar temporary suspension on 11 august .
the six week window that had created was due to expire at midnight on saturday .
" it is my intention to restore the assembly and the institutions as quickly as possible and the quickest date would be midnight , " said dr reid .
he said there was a " general feeling of finality " about the situation .
" people in northern ireland are tired of the endless wrangling , they 're tired of attempting to get this issue of arms resolved and they want the remaining issues resolved .
so there 's a sense in which we 're runnig out of road here , " said dr reid .
' changed ' when he suspended the institutions on friday night , dr reid said there was now an opportunity for paramilitaries " to take the step which will enable the issue to be resolved once and for all " .
he said the deadlock on policing had been resolved , the ira had announced that it was intensifying engagement with the arms body and the tragic events in the united states had overshadowed everything over the past two weeks .
ulster unionist leader david trimble is consulting with party colleagues as they consider their options in the wake of the suspension move .
the uup would have preferred an unlimited suspension rather than a temporary break .
hardliners within the party want mr trimble to withdraw his ministers from the power-sharing executive , but mr trimble has indicated he will consult widely before making any decision .
sinn fein president gerry adams condemned the suspension .
he said : " once again , the british government has stepped outside the good friday agreement in a bid to satisfy insatiable unionist demands . "
northern ireland finance minister mark durkan , of the sdlp , said suspension was " a regrettable but necessary device " .
" the alternatives to it would mean that the day after the executive agreed a draft programme for government and a draft budget to be put before the assembly next week , those institutions which were working effectively in the public interest would have been stood down , " he said .
irish minister for foreign affairs brian cowen said : " it is disappointing that we should , once again , find ourselves in this situation .
" however , i understand that the secretary of state has taken this difficult decision to provide us with extra time in which to build on the progress made in recent weeks . "
' unionist demands ' the dup said the institutions were " steadily losing credibility " .
assembly member ian paisley junior said the suspension was " only delaying their demise " .
david trimble precipitated the current crisis with his resignation as northern ireland first minister on 1 july because of the ira 's refusal to disarm .
the suspension came after the ira said on thursday that it would intensify its contacts with the international decommissioning body .
the political process received a boost late on thursday night when the two main unionist parties , the uup and dup , announced they had agreed to join the new police service .

two of the party 's frontline spokesmen brandished figures which , they said , back the call for " financial independence " from westminster .
conference delegates called on party leaders to launch a " hearts-and-minds campaign " to raise scottish self-confidence ahead of the 2003 holyrood elections elsewhere , one msp branded scotland 's presence in brussels " anonymous " while the party announced its intentions to launch a recruitment drive .
snp finance spokesman andrew wilson ignited the row over " fiscal freedom " one-day before delegates were due to debate the issue .
mr wilson brandished research from the house of commons library which he said proved that scotland raises more tax per head of population than the uk as a whole .
the figures suggested only four countries from the 29 member states of the organisation for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- taxed more per head of population .
luxembourg topped the tax-take league table with £ 11,786 raised per head , followed by norway -lrb- £ 11,483 -rrb- , denmark -lrb- £ 10,782 -rrb- and sweden -lrb- £ 8,650 -rrb- .
scotland came in fifth place with £ 8,132 - well ahead of the uk in 16th-place with £ 5,662 .
' ample financial base ' andrew wilson said : " we pay more tax per head of population so why do n't we get more back ?
" the argument is about revenues raised , rather than public expenditure . "
he added : " scotland has an ample financial base to support independence , which is why the scottish parliament needs to control the nation 's resources , instead of subsidising london . "
delegates also backed calls at the conference to raise scotland 's profile at home and on the international stage .
the party 's member for west of scotland kay ullrich won massive backing for a resolution , which called for scotland 's profile to be raised around the world .
she said the country was still " politically impotent " on the continent and needed independence to restore its voice .
describing a recent visit to scotland house in brussels , she said : " i was looking forward to something high-profile and in the heart of europe .
" we were taken there and deposited at the door - and if we had been on our own we would never have found it .
' ambition ' " it is n't exactly up a close , but at street level there is no sign over the door - just one name on a list of company names inside . "
delegates also backed a call by the party 's dollar branch to launch a hearts-and-minds campaign to raise scottish self-confidence ahead of the 2003 elections to the scottish parliament .
the motion said the campaign was needed to show voters that independence was the most effective way to improve their lives .
it was backed by professor neil maccormick mep who said : " independence by negotiation is won by government negotiating with government .
" we have to project ourselves to our fellow citizens as a party with capability for government - a party in which people can have confidence in order to express their own confidence in themselves . "
the hearts-and minds campaign will also be supplemented by a major recruitment drive .
party member kate higgins said : " ambition for our country should be matched by ambition for our party .
" this recruitment drive is aimed at making the snp scotland 's biggest political party .
this is a key goal in the drive to independence . "
as part of the drive , current members will be asked to recruit one more member .
a direct mail campaign will also target lapsed party members and online recruitment methods will be simplified .

a resolution calling for a comprehensive review to create a fairer , more progressive , and simpler system was passed by snp delegates .
the call comes the day after party leader john swinney told the conference he would not rule out using the " tartan tax " .
mr swinney said tough choices over the so far unused power of the scottish parliament to vary income tax by up to 3p would have to be made .
he said : " i may be faced with a choice between asking people to pay more in taxation or asking children to wait long periods for vital hospital treatment .
" let me make it clear , i will not turn my back on scotland 's children . "
shadow economy minister andrew wilson told delegates in saturday 's debate : " i was damn proud of john swinney yesterday , and damn proud to be in a party led by a man with the courage and honesty to say he is going to face hard choices .
" the snp had never shirked difficult decisions on tax , and he made that very clear yesterday . "
during the debate , snp delegates attacked the " unfair and dishonest " tax policies of successive governments and demanded a comprehensive tax review .
the review should be aimed at restoring " fairness and progressiveness " to the system , simplifying it , and delivering a " competitive " business tax regime in scotland .
the reforms demanded are in non-devolved policy fields - the present responsibility of westminster , or the future responsibility of an independent scotland .
shadow finance minister alasdair morgan said : " the people of scotland have every right to demand and expect a system of taxation that is honest , fair , easy to understand , encouraging to individual and collective enterprise , and which delivers the revenues which will enable us to make the investment in public services which john talked about yesterday . "
there was no mention of the tartan tax in the debate , beyond a general warning from activist ms dallas carter that voters did not like high taxes . "
the people of scotland have every right to demand and expect a system of taxation that is honest , fair , easy to understand . "
shadow finance minister alasdair morgan recalling the era of high personal taxation in the 1970s , she said high taxes were unpopular and counter-productive and warned : " do n't kid yourselves scots are any different .
they are not . "
she said the snp 's " penny for scotland " campaign of 1999 had not done well , and liberal democrats lost votes when they advocated a penny on tax in 1997 .
" people in the uk and scotland have got this idea into their heads that high tax is a bad thing - but they still want a national health service , education , police and fire services . "
delegates overwhelmingly carried the resolution calling for a comprehensive review of the tax system .
