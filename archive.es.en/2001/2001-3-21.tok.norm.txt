chief vet jim scudamore will join mr brown before the house of commons agriculture select committee to answer a series of questions .
the grilling comes on the same day as the first cull of healthy sheep in south-west scotland is planned , although it may be delayed because of a backlog in dealing with confirmed cases .
crisis continues 394 confirmed cases 223,564 animals slaughtered 95,872 awaiting slaughter 159,874 carcasses destroyed the move is part of the government 's attempt to stem the growing number of cases , which currently stands at 394 after the biggest day yet for outbreaks on tuesday .
tory leader william hague has already attacked the government 's response to the crisis and urged ministers to consider postponing local elections , due on 3 may , in those areas worst affected .
but the government has made clear that it does not intend to delay the vote .
it has announced a series of measures to ease hardship in communities hit by foot-and-mouth .
the head of the rural task force , michael meacher , told the commons that measures were being put in place to revitalise rural tourism where safe .
negotiations with banks he announced that affected small businesses in badly-hit rural areas would benefit from relief on business rates and temporary revaluations while customers stayed away .
mr meacher told the commons his negotiations with major banks had shown there was a prospect of extended lines of credit and repayment holidays for rural customers hit by the foot-and-mouth crisis .
he said the government was considering raising central government contributions to rate relief for affected small businesses from 75 % to 95 % .
the measures were announced as the army started work in devon and cumbria to help co-ordinate the destruction of diseased livestock .
up to 130 soldiers , military police and army logistics experts are supervising the disposal of culled animals in flocks infected by foot-and-mouth in devon , while another 80 are on their way to cumbria .
soldiers will not carry out the slaughter or burning of animals .
the tory mp for mid sussex and a former armed forces and agriculture minister , nicholas soames , argued that the army 's input should be much greater .
he said he believed that financial considerations were preventing that from happening .
" i suspect the treasury have said you are not to use the army , it 's just too expensive , " said mr soames .
a spokesman for the treasury dismissed his claims as " completely wrong and completely untrue " .
charity call meanwhile , the archbishops of canterbury and york have called for congregations across the country to support communities affected by foot-and-mouth , by holding collections on mothering sunday .
dr george carey and dr david hope have also approved special prayers for services and have set up an ecumenical fund to offer financial support .
" at this time when farming and other communities are feeling deeply isolated and under great stress , it is important that we stand together with them in thought , word and deed , " they said in a statement .

the nikkei index rose just under 913 points , or 7.5 % , to close at 13,104 after a day of frantic activity that signals its biggest one-day gain in three years .
the markets were responding to the bank of japan 's decision to cut interest rates to zero , shrugging off the heavy losses suffered in the us , where an interest rate cut did not live up to expectations .
the confidence of japanese investors is attributed to a new-found belief that both the government and the bank of japan -lrb- boj -rrb- are finally getting serious about combating the nation 's financial difficulties .
tokyo 's buoyancy was not mirrored elsewhere .
in hong kong , the hang seng index lost more than 250 points to trade at just under the 13,000 points level .
clearing up bad-debt wednesday trading was the first chance for investors to react to the boj 's decision to return to its zero interest rates policy , after a public holiday on tuesday .
the boj 's decision will make it cheaper for companies and consumers to take out loans and raised hopes that banks will soon take measures to clean up their bad-debt mountains .
old economy stocks - such as traditional retailers - were amongst the rising stocks , boosted by a slight recovery in consumer sentiment .
and key blue-chip firms such as toyota motor corporation , and telecoms firm ntt docomo also helped fuel the rise .
another factor was the continued weakening of the yen against the us dollar , which should be positive for the country 's exporters .
but despite wednesday 's surge , the tokyo stock market is still bouncing along the bottom of a 15-year low .
and the markets have a long history of interest rates being at zero - which makes experts suspect that the impact on share prices will be limited .
another reason why the market 's recovery could be a short-lived is the fact that many banks are trying to improve their books in the run-up to the end of the financial year .
as they try to make their balance sheets look better , some do attempt to boost share prices in the last few weeks of march , according to analysts in tokyo .
sharp contrast to us the sharp rises seen on the tokyo stock market are in sharp contrast to negative sentiment seen in the us .
stock markets in the us dropped on tuesday after the central bank , the federal reserve , cut interest rates by half-a-percent to 5 % .
traders hammered the dow and nasdaq , expressing anger that the fed did not cut by 0.75 % .
the dow closed down 238 at 9720 and the nasdaq finished down 4.8 % at 1857 .
analysts who predicted that a 0.5 % cut would not be enough to restore confidence to the markets appeared to have been correct .
the economic indicators which had pointed to a 0.5 % cut were ignored by many analysts who had demanded a 0.75 % decrease claiming it was needed to pull the us out of a looming recession .

the new york times reported on monday that vladimir frolov , press attache at the russian embassy in washington , worked for russia 's foreign intelligence service .
referring to the diplomat , an embassy spokesman said : " he worked at the embassy and he left .
we are not commenting on the article or on intelligence matters . "
fbi officials told the new york times that mr frolov was an officer in the svr , russia 's foreign intelligence service .
unexpected departure mr frolov was well known in press circles in washington as a frank and reliable commentator on us-russian relations .
he had told journalists here that he was unexpectedly cutting short his tour of duty in america in order to take up a job with the russian newspaper izvestia .
the fbi 's comments to the new york times suggest a very different story .
the anonymous fbi sources raised links between mr frolov 's sudden departure and the recent arrest of robert hanssen , an fbi agent accused of spying for moscow who was arrested last month .
the sources suggested that mr frolov may have been in involved in handling the hanssen operation and that is why he has now left .
mr frolov was not forced to leave but his departure might have been a pre-emptive move .
trying times mr frolov 's departure comes at a time when the us-russian relationship is already strained because of espionage issues .
following the arrest of mr hanssen , the bush administration is deliberating whether to demand that moscow withdraw some of its intelligence officers who are working in the us .
american intelligence officials have reported that russian president vladimir putin , himself a former intelligence officer , is reviving russia 's secret services .
officials at the fbi say that they have evidence that there are currently almost as many russian spies operating in america as there were during the cold war .
but it is not easy for america to respond to these increasing espionage threats .
tit for tat if america demands that russian spies return home it opens the door for retaliatory measures and american spies operating in russia could also be forced to leave their posts .
moreover the hanssen case has put washington in an awkward position .
one of the most sensitive secrets mr hanssen is accused of divulging to moscow is that americans built a tunnel underneath the russian embassy in washington in order to eavesdrop on the russian diplomats .
moscow has already made a diplomatic protest about the tunnel .
for the us government , there is one benefit from the increased levels of russian espionage in america .
benefits the more russian spies there are in the us , the more potential double agents there are for washington to try to recruit .
in the last few months at least two russian diplomats have defected from their posts in america and canada .
they were men who had been spying against their country .
and mr hanssen 's arrest was also attributed to information provided by a russian agent working for american intelligence .
