" real 28k thursday , 31 may , 2001 , 04:53 gmt 05:53 uk scottish life sale set for approval members are expected to approve the deal scottish life policyholders are expected to give their wholehearted backing to the sale of the company on thursday - triggering windfalls worth thousands of pounds .
the edinburgh-based pensions group is asking its members to approve a takeover by royal london .
and two other scottish firms are likely to follow its lead by going ahead with demutualisation later this year .
the scottish life deal needs the permission of 75 % of those policyholders who vote .
scottish provident is set for demutualisation if it gets the green light , royal london will pay out about £ 1bn to members in compensation .
however , only a small proportion of that amount will be handed out in cash .
the company says most policyholders will benefit through bonuses which will be added to policies .
only 220,000 members will receive a £ 500 cheque for the " loss of their membership " .
scottish life agreed to be taken over by its rival last october in a deal which is expected to earn with-profits policy holders about £ 4,000 each .
both companies said branch closures or job cuts would be unlikely .
windfall payments the group 's headquarters will remain in colchester , where royal london is based , while the independent financial advisers business will be located at scottish life 's headquarters in edinburgh .
two other life assurers are also due to demutualise this summer .
scottish provident is expected to be sold to the abbey national in september in a deal which would spark windfall payments for 450,000 of its members .
voting papers on the proposals were sent out to members of the 164-year-old edinburgh-based financial services company earlier this month .
qualifying members who hold with-profits policies will be eligible for a basic windfall of £ 500 .
additional variable compensation will also be paid to 385,000 members .
the amount will depend on the type and size of the policy held .
public company the average windfall is likely to be about £ 3,500 , but some members will get more than £ 100,000 .
and friends provident is currently balloting members on converting to a public company .
approval for the move would mean windfall payouts to 1.7 million qualifying members .
about half its members will receive payments of between £ 450 and £ 540 in shares , although some could get as much as £ 3,240 .
this would leave standard life as the only independent scottish mutual .
it fought off a move to force it to convert last year - but there is speculation that carpetbaggers will make another attempt in the near future .

the greater manchester town , which at the height of the trouble saw asian youths bombarding riot squad lines with petrol bombs , is less than 10 miles away from the cricket ground .
far-right white activists have been blamed for stirring the bank holiday weekend conflicts in the town , where racial tension has been high in recent weeks .
we have dealt with a much more serious atmosphere than this deborah simpson , lancashire ccc police also believe asian and white outsiders travelled from other parts of england to inflame the situation .
but a greater manchester police spokeswoman said the trouble in oldham did not mean there would be problems at the cricket , which starts on thursday .
thousands of asian youths are expected to attend the second test .
" we are planning on having plenty of resources , " she said .
" at the ground there will be a relatively average number of officers and there may be extra officers if needed . "
the oldham violence resulted in the arrests of 33 white people and 16 asians .
eleven of those arrested over the weekend are due to appear before oldham magistrates on thursday .
the oldham violence was most severe on saturday deborah simpson , of lancashire county cricket club , said it was working closely with the police in organising security for the match .
" we are working on the advice of the police .
there wo n't visibly be extra security but they will deal with it as and when . "
ms simpson said the club had hosted the 1999 match between rival pakistan v india , which had been a potentially serious situation .
" we have dealt with a much more serious atmosphere than this , " she said .
the pakistan team had been provided with a police escort , she added , but this was to protect them from over-zealous fans .
" the escort is only for match days , they have been practising at the ground and it is open to members of the public . "

disney reportedly spent £ 3.5m on the world première on board an aircraft carrier moored in pearl harbor , with thousands of guests , journalists and an air force fly-by .
the event resulted in huge advance publicity for the movie , helping propel it to the top of the us box office , becoming the most successful ever opening for a non-sequel film .
but the actress , daughter of 70s sitcom star richard beckinsale , said she was more nervous about wednesday 's low-key event in london 's leicester square .
" this is much noisier and scarier than it was in hawaii because it is britain and my friends and family are all here , " she said .
thousands of fans gathered to see beckinsale and her co-stars , american heart-throb josh hartnett and trainspotting actor ewen bremner .
one fan , ed , had already seen the movie .
" it 's not that fantastic , i had high expectations - the battle scene is brilliant but the start and the end could 've been better , " he told bbc news online .
he still liked it enough to come along specially to see the gala - though he was adamant that it was the producers and director he wanted to see .
the thought of seeing kate beckinsale was what pushed his friend kane into joining him at the premiere .
another , david , was also waiting for the actress .
" i 'm pleased kate beckinsale got the part - she 's very pretty but she 's not all flashy glamour like julia roberts , " he said .
but the biggest cheers were for josh hartnett , who got one group of teenagers so excited that they fell off their perches standing on the railings .
hartnett carried on the tradition of partially dressing down for movie premieres by wearing a pair of scruffy brown boots with a smart navy suit .
fellow star ben affleck did not attend , as was rumoured earlier in the day .
bremner said the screaming fans outside the cinema were " wild " .
" people in hawaii were much more reserved and there were no real fans there .
here it is kind of wild , " he said .
other celebrities attending the premiere included australian singer natalie imbruglia , royle family star ralf little , actress amanda holden and comedians david baddiel and frank skinner .
the film has received a mauling from us critics who have attacked the film 's weak dialogue and heavy reliance on special effects .
but the reviews have not put thousands of americans off , who spent more than £ 53m on it at the box office last weekend .
pearl harbor established the second biggest opening of all time , behind the $ 90.2m -lrb- £ 63.6m -rrb- gross for the lost world in 1997 .
its producer , jerry bruckheimer , said the critics were entitled to their opinion but it was the public that mattered .
" the people are the ones who pay to see it and they have been doing so in large numbers in america .
we hope it is the same here , " he said .
in the film , affleck plays rafe mccawley , an american fighter pilot , who falls in love with naval nurse evelyn johnson -lrb- kate beckinsale -rrb- .
an love triangle develops when his childhood friend and fellow fighter pilot danny walker -lrb- hartnett -rrb- falls for her as well , after they both believe mccawley has died during an air battle in britain .
emotional matters come to a head as the japanese launch their surprise attack on pearl harbor in december 1941 .

northern ireland secretary john reid said the new plastic bullets were safer than the existing ones , when they were announced in april .
however , relatives of those killed by plastic bullets have rejected dr reid 's assurances .
dr reid said a study by the defence scientific advisory council found the new round would be lighter , faster and made from more robust material .
he said it concluded that the new rounds were " on balance a great deal safer than the existing one " .
' alternative to firearms ' the baton rounds are to be used in situations where they would otherwise be forced to use firearms , he added .
police officers and soldiers are also to be issued with the new baton rounds in britain .
however , members of the united campaign against plastic bullets who have seen the study , said it found there was a greater chance of a round which strikes the head being lodged in the skull .
jim mccabe , whose wife nora died after being hit by a plastic bullet in 1981 , said the report concluded the new rounds were more dangerous than the existing design .
chris patten 's independent commission on the future of policing in northern ireland said there should be investment in research into finding an acceptable , less dangerous , alternative to the present baton round .
its report is the basis of legislation which is shaping the province 's new police service of northern ireland .

despite advise from the welsh assembly that footpaths can be reopened - as long as the are 3kms from an infected area - 98 % of the paths in powys remain closed .
crisis in wales total confirmed cases uk-wide 1,570 - with 92 in wales powys - 56 cases anglesey - 13 cases monmouthshire - 16 cases caerphilly 1 rhondda cynon taff - 1 neath port talbot -1 newport - 3 while many areas of wales reported a rise visitor numbers last weekend powys remains badly affected by the foot-and-mouth .
more than half of the 92 confirmed cases of the disease in wales have been within the county and the stranglehold of the virus on the areas economy remains tight .
however councillors face a difficult decision many businesses want the 10,000 kms of paths in the area to reopen but farmers are concerned about the further spread of the virus .
financial ruin tourism operators want them reopened immediately to try to save many businesses which are currently facing financial ruin .
but many of the footpaths go directly through farmland - and farmers are worried increased access at this stage could lead to a spread of the infection .
we have to help the industry get aggressively back into the marketplace and we also have to ensure that the industry reinvents itself into a leaner , keener machine more able to cope with any future crises wtb chief executive , jonathan jones in ceredigion in west wales the council has retained a ban on walking on public footpaths throughout the area - despite the fact that there has been no cases of foot-and-mouth in the county .
earlier this week the wales tourist board -lrb- wtb -rrb- published details of an in-depth study into the effects of the foot-and-mouth crisis on tourism across wales .
the organisation again urged the assembly to provide an urgent £ 10m recovery fund to help stimulate the industry .
wtb chief executive jonathan jones said foot-and-mouth was the " worst ever " crisis to hit the industry .
the study indicates that 75 % of businesses who responded have a lost of 60 % in their sales revenue .
the wtb argue that the £ 10m support package being called for would help to pay for advertising to bring back " stayaway " visitors to key tourism areas in north , mid south and west wales .
jonathan jones said : " on the positive side , the results also confirm that the measures put forward by wtb to the national assembly for wales for their consideration are the right ones for the industry .
" we have to help the industry get aggressively back into the marketplace and we also have to ensure that the industry reinvents itself into a leaner , keener machine more able to cope with any future crises . "

mr wahid is the first indonesian leader to face impeachment .

cosla spokesperson " there have been talks between individual councils and scottish care " real 28k joe campbell , chairman of scottish care " this is not a sudden move by scottish care " real 28k thursday , 31 may , 2001 , 07:43 gmt 08:43 uk ultimatum over nursing home costs homes in the aberdeen area have been targeted private nursing homes have been accused of holding a gun to the head of a scottish council by issuing an ultimatum over funding .
scottish care grampian has given aberdeen city council two weeks to increase its payments .
the umbrella organisation warned that its members would refuse to take any new residents after that date unless the local authority agreed to a higher rate .
and there have been warnings that other parts of scotland could be hit by similar demands .
other councils may face the ultimatum but a spokeswoman for the convention of scottish local authority -lrb- cosla -rrb- has said any extra money should go to improving the quality of care where it is needed .
the operators of nursing and residential facilities say they are not getting enough money to cover their costs .
scottish care grampian represents 19 of aberdeen 's 23 nursing homes and both of the city 's residential homes .
it has told the city council that it will halt any new admissions from 13 june unless a full economic rent is paid by the local authority .
this amounts to an extra £ 20 to £ 40 per week for each resident .
robert deeming , the chairman of scottish care grampian , said its members had no choice but to deliver the ultimatum .
what we are currently being paid is no where near what the true costs are robert deeming , scottish care grampian he said : " we do n't think that this is unreasonable and this is not a step that we have taken lightly .
" but what we are currently being paid is nowhere near what the true costs are . "
however , he stressed that no-one would be evicted and existing service agreements would be honoured .
june lamond , the convenor of aberdeen city council 's community services committee , said : " i am disgusted that we received such a letter today , so close to the general election .
" as far as we are concerned discussions were ongoing and it is like having a gun placed at our head . "
however , the problem is not confined to the north east .
funding issues while aberdeen is the first area to be targeted , a spokesman for scottish care said other councils could received similar ultimatums in the coming days and weeks .
he said this could cause a crisis in the elderly care sector if the funding issues were not addressed .
cosla 's spokesperson on social work and health , rita miller , said she was not in favour of a blanket increase .
she said : " we would not be recommending there would be a general increase that took no account of quality . "
on tuesday , scottish care warned scottish executive officials that many private nursing homes faced closure unless payments from local authorities were increased .
the organisation , which represents 800 of the 1,100 private residential homes in scotland , said that others would have to refuse to take council-funded residents .
it was agreed that further talks would be held with the executive and the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- within the next two weeks .
