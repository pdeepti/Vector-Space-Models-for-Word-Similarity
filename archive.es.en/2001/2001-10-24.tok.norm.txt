passenger group rail future says it has obtained documents showing that arriva trains northern wants to cut more than 1,000 services a week this winter .
and arriva has admitted meeting officials from the strategic rail authority -lrb- sra -rrb- to ask for permission to reduce the service .
it needs to secure the support of the sra to avoid paying penalties for failing to provide the trains .
arriva is training 120 new drivers this year train companies which fail to meet service thresholds detailed in the franchise may have to pay penalties depending on the number of delays and cancellations .
last year arriva made net payments of more than £ 9m to the sra after failing to meet performance targets .
and the sra , fed up with the cancellation passengers have already suffered for several months , is expected to announce later this week that arriva will face further heavy fines unless services improve quickly .
but arriva , which operates trains across north-east and north-west england , says despite an intensive driver-training programme , it can not run all 1,600 trains a day pledged under the current franchise agreement .
arriva took over the franchise in february 2000 and will carry on with the operation until 2003 .
the company says that when it was handed control there was already a shortage of staff combined with other problems such as insufficient rolling stock and maintenance backlogs .
drivers poached to bring in more drivers , arriva has launched what it describes as one of the largest recruitment campaigns ever seen in the industry .
it hopes to attract more than 120 drivers by the end of the year and bring in a further 170 in 2002 .
however , each of the drivers need 18 months training before they can operate without supervision .
one of the problems is that some arriva drivers have been poached by other companies . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's simon montague " the strategic rail authority is unsympathtic " see also : 05 sep 01 -pipe- business train cuts to ease driver shortage 22 jun 01 -pipe- uk train strike talks continue 13 jun 01 -pipe- uk changing the guards 13 jun 01 -pipe- uk fresh hopes of end to rail strikes 12 jun 01 -pipe- uk strike disruption on railways 15 jun 98 -pipe- business arriva chief quits amid profits alert internet links : arriva strategic rail authority rail passengers council the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top england stories now : tories attack brixton drugs scheme police shoot man on the m6 leanne killer jailed for life ivf mix-up heads for court inquiry into warship accident britain ' sheltering al-qaeda leader ' venables named leeds boss transplant first for cancer patient links to more england stories are at the foot of the page .

officials say they were going on the best information they had at the time , but workers wonder if lives could have been saved by a quicker response .

" they are going to test everyone up there who had nothing to do with it , and yet they wo n't test us .
common sense would have told them the letter had to go through a postal facility before it went up there , " he said .
capitol hill staff were tested immediately after a letter sent to senator daschle was discovered to have contained anthrax .
mass testing of postal workers did not begin until five days later .
mr anderson works three blocks from the brentwood facility where two workers have already died from anthrax .
he said no one was surprised by the slow response .
" we 're mad .

she tried to deflect criticism by refocusing attention on those who sent the anthrax-laden letters .

that 's the important thing people have to keep in focus , " she said .
although workers are now receiving antibiotics , they were told just last week that the risks were minimal , but officials said that they were going on the best information they had .
centers for disease control director dr jeffrey koplan said that they believed a person would actually have to open the letter to be exposed .
he told the us senate : " there was no reason to think - based on everything we had seen so far - that this was a possibility . "

the demand will be made by local mp sandra osborne when she meets aviation minister david jamieson on wednesday .
the labour mp 's move follows confirmation that work on the project has been put on hold .
the centre will be operated by a consortium of airlines - including british airways and british midland - which bought a controlling share in the national air traffic services -lrb- nats -rrb- last year .
sandra osborne will press the minister last week they confirmed that the reduction in air travel following the terrorist attacks in america last month had forced a review of the phasing of all investment projects .
preparatory work is still going on at prestwick , where it was predicted that the construction project would create 600 jobs .
but once the bulldozers have finished their work the builders will not be moving in to construct a new control centre .
the department of transport confirmed last week that the project had been shelved by the consortium .
critics of the government 's partial privatisation of air traffic control insist a new centre is vital - and say they are concerned that finance is being put before safety .
david jamieson has issued a long-term pledge mrs osborne is due to meet mr jamieson on wednesday to discuss the future of the project .
she will press him for a guarantee that the original plans for prestwick will go ahead .
speaking after last week 's announcement , mr jamieson stressed that the plans had not been shelved indefinitely - and promised that the government was " totally committed " to pursuing the project in the long term .
he told bbc radio scotland that safety remained a priority and that there would be no long-term delay in building the centre .
he said the government had " reluctantly " accepted nats ' request to suspend building work temporarily .
" at the very earliest opportunity , we will be looking again at the circumstances as they unfold and making sure this centre does go ahead , " he said .

four men took to the branches to guard it and then one remained in the tree on six-hour shifts for some time afterwards to ensure it was left standing .

war bond sales would enable ordinary americans to show support for the united states ' campaign against the suspects in the 11 september attacks , according to the bill 's backers .
" at this time of national unity these war bonds serve as an ideal vehicle for americans to support efforts to bring those responsible for these attacks to justice , " said john sweeney , a republican congressman from new york who initiated the bill .
the house of representatives approved the proposal on a voice vote .
