the wto ruled on 1 march that the eu broke the trade body 's rules when it imposed import duties on indian bed linen in december 1997 .
the eu failed to consider " constructive remedies " before the duties were imposed and did not evaluate " all relevant economic factors " in assessing the impact on domestic producers , the wto said .
" whilst mindful of the concerns of eu industry , our swift action to bring ourselves into line with the -lrb- wto -rrb- panel decision on bed linen from india is a tangible demonstration of the importance the eu attaches to compliance with wto rulings whether we win or lose , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
the move comes as the eu and us try to drum up support from emerging markets for a new round of global trade talks in december .
wooing india india has been campaigning for better access to the markets of industrialised countries , arguing that the uruguay round of trade agreements has not been implemented .
the wto ruled in india 's favour after it complained over how the eu calculated the duties .
the eu said that the " injurious dumping " of indian bed linen continued but that it had decided to suspend the duties rather than recalculate them .
the eu imports about 3.6bn euros -lrb- $ 3.2bn , £ 2bn -rrb- of indian textiles a year .
the suspension will become permanent if there is no request for a review by european importers or the textile industry within six months .
the eu and other countries reserve the right to impose anti-dumping duties unilaterally on products they claim are being exported by at unfair low prices .

" adjustments in economic activity are intensifying further , reflecting a substantial decline in exports and production , " it said in its august monthly report .
the future will not be much better , with the bank reporting a continued period of economic adjustment in line with the slowdown in the global economy .
the report comes after the central bank 's surprise decision on tuesday to loosen further its already very loose monetary policy , to try and pull japan from the edge of recession and ease the pain of planned structural reforms .
economic slowdown the bank reported that exports were falling due " not only to a slowdown in overseas economies but also to sluggish demand for it-related goods . "
corporate profits and business sentiment " are also worsening particularly in the manufacturing sector " , it warned .
the slowdown in corporate activity is having a strong impact on household spending which remained " flat on the whole . "
the bank however said there may be some relief later in the year from an expected pick-up in overseas economies , especially the us .
" there still exist such general views that around the end of this year , ongoing inventory adjustments in it-related goods worldwide are likely to peak out and overseas economies , particularly the us , will start to recover , " it said .

the results for july are a bit of good news after daewoo motor sales , the marketing arm of daewoo motor , reported a huge 71 % fall in first-half revenues and profits on tuesday .
daewoo had operating profits of 13.2bn won -lrb- $ 10.3m -rrb- in july on sales of 456.2bn won , it said on wednesday .
" we have posted operating profits for four consecutive months .
our restructuring efforts are beginning to pay off , " said a daewoo motor spokesman .
creditors have been negotiating a sale of korea 's third-ranked car maker with us giant gm and partner fiat of italy for the past year .
for the first half of the year , the unlisted car maker posted negative operating profit of 23.6bn won on 2.36 trillion won of sales , the company said .
job cuts daewoo sacked more than 1,700 workers in february when creditors , who had been supporting the company since july 1999 , lost their patience and demanded cuts to stem massive losses .
daewoo 's main plant , which is seen as the stumbling block in takeover talks with gm , contributed almost 40 % to its july profits figure .
" we have proven the pupyong plant can be profitable .
we believe gm will be interested in the plant , " the spokesman said .
the pupyong plant is the base of the company 's union , which clashed with riot police while protesting over february 's layoffs , and it is considered one of the oldest and least cost efficient .
creditors , led by state-run korea development bank , have conceded that it is not financially attractive , but they have fought to keep it open because it employs more than 7,000 people and thousands more at related firms .
daewoo currently has about 15,000 employees in korea , down from 22,000 less than a year ago .
gm and fiat submitted an initial purchase proposal in may but talks since have not produced a firm deal yet .

a new company is to be formed in its place in which the african states , all of them former french colonies , will play a much smaller role , while a significant stake will be held by the french national carrier , air france .
with well over $ 400m of debt , and nobody willing or able to bail the company out , air afrique had nowhere else to go after months of discussion about what to do with the debt-ridden regional airline , the african leaders at their summit in brazzaville agreed to liquidate the airline .
air france will inject about $ 69m in start-up capital into the new company .
the new airline will have the same name .
plan resisted air france , a minority shareholder in the outgoing company , will now hold 35 % of the firm , the biggest single stake in the company .
the 11 participating african countries will own just over 20 % .
institutional investors will hold 38 % of the new company , and employees will own 5 % the plan is basically one proposed by air france , but resisted for months by both the african leaders and air afrique 's 4,000 employees .
but with well over $ 400m of debt , and nobody willing or able to bail the company out , air afrique had nowhere else to go .

a new company is to be formed in its place in which the african states , all of them former french colonies , will play a much smaller role , while a significant stake will be held by the french national carrier , air france .
with well over $ 400m of debt , and nobody willing or able to bail the company out , air afrique had nowhere else to go after months of discussion about what to do with the debt-ridden regional airline , the african leaders at their summit in brazzaville agreed to liquidate the airline .
air france will inject about $ 69m in start-up capital into the new company .
the new airline will have the same name .
plan resisted air france , a minority shareholder in the outgoing company , will now hold 35 % of the firm , the biggest single stake in the company .
the 11 participating african countries will own just over 20 % .
institutional investors will hold 38 % of the new company , and employees will own 5 % the plan is basically one proposed by air france , but resisted for months by both the african leaders and air afrique 's 4,000 employees .
but with well over $ 400m of debt , and nobody willing or able to bail the company out , air afrique had nowhere else to go .

this is because the us has been importing far more than it has exported during the last couple of years , the imf said .
the dollar fell in tokyo on wednesday following the warning , sliding against both the yen and the euro in asian trade , despite reminders that the fund 's warning was not new .
" it 's important to note that the imf has said this many times before , " said foreign exchange analytics partner david gilmore .
the dollar fell to 121.37 yen , just short of a two month low , and the euro rose to a three month high against the dollar at 90.38 , in the us late on tuesday after the report 's release .
a sharp rise in us imports during 2000 offset a healthy rise in exports , pushing the external current account deficit out to 4.5 % from 3.5 % in 1999 , the fund reported .
the $ 28.3bn deficit is not sustainable in the long-run , its size raising " concerns that the dollar might be at risk for a sharp depreciation " , the imf said .
expensive tax cuts the fund also warned that the total cost of the $ 1.35 trillion tax cuts pushed through by president george w. bush was " likely to be higher than current estimates " , arguing that the tax measures were unlikely to expire as scheduled .
the fund warned against overspending by the us authorities due to such uncertainty .
however , the imf also described the tax cuts as " appropriate and timely " and said they " will help to insure against a sharper economic slowdown " .
gloomy outlook the " uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook -lsb- is -rsb- higher than usual " at the moment in the us , the fund said .
businesses must continue improving efficiency if the us economy was to snap back to a path of sustainable growth , it said .
this would boost us companies in competition with non-us firms , both in their domestic market and in their export markets .
the imf also urged the us to " continue to push for further liberalisation of international trade on a multilateral basis " .
social security and medicare having acknowledged the short and medium-term benefits of president bush 's tax cuts , the imf went on to call for " priority to be given to strengthening the financial outlook for the state social security pension and the official medicare health insurance , particularly because at present there are sufficient resources available to address these problems " .
us politicians who had been opposed to the recent tax cuts had said that they were damaging to the pension and health insurance programme .

but music-swapping is a pastime that may be soon halted if recording companies have their way .
consumers are going to run screaming from these kinds of solutions aram sinnreich , analyst , jupiter media metrix stung by the success of internet-based napster , major record labels , such as vivendi universal , sony , emi and warner music , have signed on with encryption firms that have developed technologies to halt the so-called pirating of copyrighted music .
for the encryption companies it may mean millions of dollars in profits as record label after record label signs on to take advantage of the new , seemingly perfected technology .
for the record companies , however , it could be a public-relations disaster .
already bruised and battered from their public fight with all but busted napster over the legality of its service , the recording firms are perceived by a wary public as the goliath who defeated david .
public relations hazard " consumers are going to run screaming from these kinds of solutions , " says jupiter media metrix analyst aram sinnreich .
" this could be more of pr hazard for -lsb- record labels -rsb- than napster ever was . "
country music 's charley pride was the first artist to get an encrypted cd what made napster so wildly successful was a file-compression technology called mp3 that allows users to put many more songs - hours instead of minutes - on a compact disc than could normally fit .
the compressed format also allows music to be sent across the internet in far less time than it would otherwise take .
what drove napster was music-swapping , which involves taking a cd - in its entirety or just one song - and trading it with an online partner who may reciprocate with an album or song of their own .
the process of taking music from a cd is called ripping .
once the music is ripped from the cd , it can be loaded onto a computer hard drive or put on a recordable compact disc .
because mp3 allows song files to be reduced greatly with any noticeable degradation in sound quality , it is a technology that is also wildly popular with users of personal digital assistants -lrb- pdas -rrb- .
the compression technology permits quick and easy downloads for a day 's full of music .
useless cds there is a concern among cd buyers that anti-piracy technology being deployed - currently undergoing testing , by firms such as macrovision and midbar technologies - may render legally obtained cds useless for some users .
what we do is a modification to the way the cd is placed on the disk that confuses the -lsb- computer 's -rsb- drive eyal shavit , midbar the scrambling-technology being tested works with nearly all cd music players .
but even macrovision president bill krepick says perfection is beyond the pale .
" it 's impossible to get to 100 % " , he said , adding that he expects 99.6 % to 99.7 % of all players to be able to play cds encrypted with his company 's safeaudio technology .
it is not known which music firms are using encryption technology or to what extent .
it has been reported that macrovision has distributed nearly 200,000 cds to test safeaudio , its anti-piracy system .
a spokeswoman for macrovision confirmed the 200,000 figure but was able to provide further information .
already in distribution " we provide the technology to a label , and they 're the ones who actually produce and distribute -lsb- the cds -rsb- , " says miao chuang , director of marketing at macrovision .
" it 's to the interest of the rights owners as well as technology providers that we have to work together to make sure the interests of both sides are well covered , " ms chaung told bbc news online .
" that 's the purpose of all the field tests . "
the technology works by scrambling or distorting the music on the cds , making it difficult for cd players on computers to play the music - and thus replicate it .
" what we do is a modification to the way the cd is placed on the disk that confuses the -lsb- computer 's -rsb- drive , " says eyal shavit , vice president for research and development at midbar technologies .
the company recently revealed that one million cds protected by midbar technology have so far been released into the european market .
plans are under discussion for entry into the us market .
universal music is but one record company that has been evaluating various technologies in the us and europe to protect cds and other physical formats from theft .
" this is obviously an issue that is important , " universal music said in a written statement .
" we are working rigorously towards a solution that protects our artists ' works while maximizing the consumer experience . "

it says that a critical spying organisation , the national security agency , has been slow to adapt to the hi-tech challenges of the 21st century .
" the national security agency is america 's most important asset for technical collection of terrorism information , yet it is losing its capability to target and exploit the modern communications systems used by terrorists , seriously weakening the nsa 's ability to warn of possible attacks , " said report by the senate committee on intelligence .
the chances are they -lsb- terrorists -rsb- will be using laptop computers , sophisticated encryption , and weaponry their predecessors could not even have imagined senate report the report , which covers intelligence activities during the 1999-2000 congressional session , suggests more funding has already been allocated to improving the technology available to the intelligence services .
but even with the extra spending , the committee said the national security agency was failing to keep pace with revolutionary developments in global telecommunications .
eavesdropping on the world the nsa eavesdrops on communications across the world , be they radio transmissions phone , fax or e-mail , in order to detect threats against us citizens .
in the past , the nsa 's main adversary was the soviet union , so it had no problem keeping pace with a technologically inferior nation .
but now , it faces opponents who are just as advanced , if not more , than the usa .
" today we must still deal with terrorists , insurgents , and others who have hundreds of years of history fueling their cases .
but the chances are they will be using laptop computers , sophisticated encryption , and weaponry their predecessors could not even have imagined , " said the report .
in february , the head of the nsa openly admitted his organisation was " behind the curve in keeping up with the global telecommunications revolution " .
general mike hayden said the us had been unable to prevent an attack on its embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 because of that gap .
rare insight the report , released earlier this month , provides a rare insight into one of america 's most secretive intelligence agencies .
even the intelligence budget is classified , although experts estimate amounts to $ 30 billion annually .
the committee is concerned by the impact of widespread encryption on the nsa 's ability to collect signals intelligence on threats to us interests senate report the senate committee said funds had to be switched from short-term goals to building an intelligence agency that met the challenge of the 21st century .
" the committee concluded the crisis demanded immediate attention and warranted shifting resources in order to stave off a steady and inevitable degradation of the nsa 's unique and invaluable capabilities . "
" failure to do so will irreversibly undermine the nsa and its ability to perform in a transformed global information technology arena , " said the committee .
the report suggests the future of counter intelligence may not lie with spies but with hi-tech ways of collecting information , called measurement and signature intelligence -lrb- masint -rrb- .
" masint can significantly strengthen collection against many emerging threats , and potentially become the intelligence community 's most valuable source of technical intelligence in the 21st century , " it said .
masint involves gathering spectroradiometric , electro-optical , acoustic or other types of data which can then be interpreted .
decoding information one area of concern for the us how the rise of encryption could undermine efforts to spy on suspected terrorists .
" in the last two decades the growing use of computers , computer networks , the internet cellular telephones and other telecommunications technologies has increased the demand for encryption , " said the senators .
" the committee is concerned by the impact of widespread encryption on the nsa 's ability to collect signals intelligence on threats to us interests , and on the ability of the fbi and other law enforcement agencies to conduct their counter terrorist , counterintelligence , and law enforcement missions . "
another danger highlighted by the report were efforts by foreign nations to conceal , or mislead the us about activities such as military deployments or the development of weapons of mass destruction the committee said it was " deeply concerned " about so-called denial and deception efforts , saying it had increased funding in this area .

the chances are they -lsb- terrorists -rsb- will be using laptop computers , sophisticated encryption , and weaponry their predecessors could not even have imagined senate report the report , which covers intelligence activities during the 1999-2000 congressional session , suggests more funding has already been allocated to improving the technology available to the intelligence services .
but even with the extra spending , the committee said the national security agency was failing to keep pace with revolutionary developments in global telecommunications .
eavesdropping on the world the nsa eavesdrops on communications across the world , be they radio transmissions phone , fax or e-mail , in order to detect threats against us citizens .
bin laden : suspected of masterminding embassy attacks in the past , the nsa 's main adversary was the soviet union , so it had no problem keeping pace with a technologically inferior nation .
but now , it faces opponents who are just as advanced , if not more , than the usa .
" today we must still deal with terrorists , insurgents , and others who have hundreds of years of history fueling their cases .
but the chances are they will be using laptop computers , sophisticated encryption , and weaponry their predecessors could not even have imagined , " said the report .
in february , the head of the nsa openly admitted his organisation was " behind the curve in keeping up with the global telecommunications revolution " .
general mike hayden said the us had been unable to prevent an attack on its embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 because of that gap .
rare insight the report , released earlier this month , provides a rare insight into one of america 's most secretive intelligence agencies .
even the intelligence budget is classified , although experts estimate amounts to $ 30 billion annually .
the committee is concerned by the impact of widespread encryption on the nsa 's ability to collect signals intelligence on threats to us interests senate report the senate committee said funds had to be switched from short-term goals to building an intelligence agency that met the challenge of the 21st century .
" the committee concluded the crisis demanded immediate attention and warranted shifting resources in order to stave off a steady and inevitable degradation of the nsa 's unique and invaluable capabilities . "
" failure to do so will irreversibly undermine the nsa and its ability to perform in a transformed global information technology arena , " said the committee .
the report suggests the future of counter intelligence may not lie with spies but with hi-tech ways of collecting information , called measurement and signature intelligence -lrb- masint -rrb- .
" masint can significantly strengthen collection against many emerging threats , and potentially become the intelligence community 's most valuable source of technical intelligence in the 21st century , " it said .
masint involves gathering spectroradiometric , electro-optical , acoustic or other types of data which can then be interpreted .
decoding information one area of concern for the us how the rise of encryption could undermine efforts to spy on suspected terrorists .
" in the last two decades the growing use of computers , computer networks , the internet cellular telephones and other telecommunications technologies has increased the demand for encryption , " said the senators .
" the committee is concerned by the impact of widespread encryption on the nsa 's ability to collect signals intelligence on threats to us interests , and on the ability of the fbi and other law enforcement agencies to conduct their counter terrorist , counterintelligence , and law enforcement missions . "
another danger highlighted by the report were efforts by foreign nations to conceal , or mislead the us about activities such as military deployments or the development of weapons of mass destruction the committee said it was " deeply concerned " about so-called denial and deception efforts , saying it had increased funding in this area .

but the idea is a controversial one .
the vice-president has warned that the island 's economy and its security could be threatened .
the president says taiwan must be competitive taiwan isolated itself from mainland china to preserve the island 's national security and its economic independence .
now president chen shui-bian has said that a new , more relaxed policy is the right path to follow .
in an era of globalisation , he said , taiwan could not resist the pressure for greater trade and economic relations with china .
to open up , he added , would help taiwan maintain its competitiveness in the global market .
his comments come after a committee of economic advisors recommended at the weekend that taiwan make preparations for direct shipping and air links and lift the current cap on the amount local companies can invest in china .
' active ' policy the move , which has yet to be adopted as official policy , has strong support from the business community which sees it as a way to revive taiwan 's struggling economy .
but vice-president annette lu said lifting restrictions would mean handing over taiwan 's hard-earned money to mainland china .
taiwan 's current policy goes by the name " go slow , be patient " .
the proposal is to replace it with one called " active opening , effective management " .
although the island is just 150km -lrb- 95 miles -rrb- from the mainland , businessmen and travellers have to fly via hong kong , and goods pass the same way .
taiwanese firms are limited to investing not more than $ 50m in each project on the mainland .
nevertheless it is estimated that taiwanese companies have pumped more than $ 50bn into china in the past decade , some by circumventing the restrictions .
with the global slowdown hurting taiwan , companies want the policy relaxed so they can access cheap labour and new markets .
president chen has now given his support saying taiwan needs to " go outside and find more opportunities " .
but there are fears that the move could instead undermine taiwan 's economy by opening the floodgates for businesses to leave the island in droves .
ms lu has criticised what she called mainland fever among taiwan 's companies , which she said were taking the island 's lifeblood to china .
and taiwan 's national security bureau has warned that china is trying to force the island to reunify with the mainland through economic means .
the government says it is aware of the threat , but believes it can deal with it by being prudent and creating effective risk management measures . watch / listen on this story taiwanese businessman chuck han " business is business " see also : 13 aug 01 -pipe- business taiwan to free up china investment 10 aug 01 -pipe- asia-pacific taiwan denies un bid threatens china 23 jul 01 -pipe- business taiwan 's economy worsens 20 jul 01 -pipe- business taiwan 's growth set to halve to 2.2 % 30 may 01 -pipe- business tech crisis hits taiwan economy 18 may 01 -pipe- asia-pacific taiwan reaches out to china 06 aug 01 -pipe- country profiles country profile : taiwan internet links : taiwan globe the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : blaze kills 42 in indonesian bar china vows to overhaul courts koreas trade fresh war of words philippines church apologises for sex abuse search for ' spy ' pilots in china chinese chemical spill kills 13 malaysian state passes islamic law vietnam 's unburied soldiers head home links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .
