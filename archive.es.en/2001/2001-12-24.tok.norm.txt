a virgin spokesman said it was discussing " a commercial agreement " with delta air transport -lrb- dat -rrb- , but denied press reports of a full scale merger .
a deal would give virgin express , part of sir richard branson 's virgin empire , a role in what will effectively be belgium 's new national airline .
the sunday times had reported that a green light for a merger had been given by a group of belgian investors who on friday acquired debt-laden dat from sabena 's receivers for a symbolic one euro .
salvage operation virgin express launched an unsuccessful bid to take over part of sabena 's operations after the belgian airline went bankrupt last month .
the failed carrier was one of virgin express 's key competitors .
dat 's new owners , led by former european union industry commissioner etienne davignon , were recruited by the belgian government to put together a viable new airline from the remnants of sabena .
talks with virgin express over a possible merger , aimed at shoring up the new airline 's financial position , began earlier this month .
dat 's new owners were ordered by sabena 's receivers to restructure the smaller airline 's 100m euro debt as a condition of the buy-out going ahead .
sabena collapse dat , a sabena subsidiary operating mostly on short-haul routes , made a profit this year , and did not file for bankruptcy at the same time as its parent company .
sabena collapsed last month after its major shareholder swissair went bankrupt in the wake of the 11 september attacks .
the heavily-indebted airline , which was part-owned by the belgian government , had been depending on a promised cash injection from swissair to survive .

but as frederick noronha reports from goa , the country is working on developing programmes in native languages .
the 496 million hindi speakers , and the hundreds of millions on the subcontinent who speak bengali , urdu and other indian languages , would like to make computers their own .
but their problems start at the keyboard , since there is a big difference between indian-languages and english when it comes to reading and writing on computers .
keyboards designed for the english language alphabet must be adapted , with special software , so that their keys can produce indian texts .
this software constructs indian language characters out of smaller pieces known as glyphs .
for example , the south indian kannada language pieces together 142 glyphs in thousands of combinations to produce words based on kannada 's 49 characters .
ill-communication in defining global standards for computing , the special needs of less influential nations seem to get sidetracked .
to complicate matters , early researchers working on this issue in india constructed their own sets of glyphs or character pieces .
large number of potential computer users in india this often meant that text composed on one computer could not be read on another loaded with rival software .
this was a great handicap since it is the ability of computers to talk to one another that makes them such powerful tools .
as computing spreads across india , these language-based digital divisions persist even today .
recently , the south indian states of karnataka and tamil nadu pushed ahead with standards of their own .
and small firms like mithi in the central indian city of pune have worked out their own solution to send and receive e-mail in 11 indian languages besides english .
free alternatives most of the current indian language programs have been developed for use with microsoft 's windows operating system .
but many computer users in the region are pushing for free software alternatives that everyone can afford .
at the prestigious indian institute of technology and the national centre of software technology , tamil and hindi language systems have been developed for chennai and bombay .
both rely on the linux operating system which is freely available on the internet .
now that these breakthroughs have been achieved there 's real hope among the 90 % of indians who do not read and write in english that the digital language divide will soon be bridged .

the lord of the rings : the fellowship of the ring took $ 45.25m -lrb- £ 31.4m -rrb- in the united states and canada between friday and sunday , making it number one on the box office chart .
but that was less than half the record-breaking total of $ 93.5m -lrb- £ 65.7m -rrb- that harry potter and the sorcerer 's stone earned on its opening us weekend in november .
the lord of the rings , based on jrr tolkien 's novel , has taken a total of more than $ 133m -lrb- £ 92m -rrb- across the world since opening on wednesday .
film company new line , who made the epic fantasy , has said it never expected the lord of the rings to match harry potter 's opening box office totals .
it is aimed at an older audience and its three-hour running time restricts the number of times a day it can be shown on each screen .
us box office 1 .
the lord of the rings 2 .
ocean 's eleven 3 .
jimmy neutron : boy genius 4 .
vanilla sky 5 .
how high but its earnings have matched industry expectations , and are " definitely a relief , " according to new line 's president of worldwide marketing and distribution , rolf mittweg .
many fans attended screenings dressed as hobbits .
" people like to be transported into another world " , especially at christmas , said mr mittweg .
the biggest totals at overseas cinemas came in the uk , where it took £ 11.1m over the weekend , and germany , where it took dm30m -lrb- £ 9.4m -rrb- .
and in new zealand , where the movie was filmed , it broke " every record in the book " , mr mittweg said .
as for other new releases , jim carrey 's drama the majestic became one of the biggest flops of the year , entering the top 10 at number eight , earning just $ 5m -lrb- £ 3.5m -rrb- .
carrey , better-known for his goofy comedy roles , plays an amnesiac screenwriter in a 1950s small town , unaware that he is being pursued in a communist witch hunt .
it was " definitely the worst big movie of the year " , according to the wall street journal .
home improvement and galaxy quest star tim allen also had a disappointing opening weekend , with comedy joe somebody coming in one place below the majestic .
rat pack remake ocean 's eleven , starring julia roberts , brad pitt and george clooney , was the second favourite movie in the us and canada .
animated film jimmy neutron : boy genius was at number three , while tom cruise and penelope cruz 's vanilla sky was at number four .
cannabis comedy how high , starring rappers method man and redman , entered at number five , pushing harry potter down to six .
meanwhile , plans have been announced for a third scary movie film - which will poke fun at fantastical blockbusters harry potter , the lord of the rings and star wars : episode i - the phantom menace , according to reports .
scary movie 3 : episode i - lord of the brooms will be released at the end of the 2002 to coincide with the next instalments of the films it is spoofing .
it will be the story of an orphan who embarks on a magical quest around the world and beyond to rid the universe of evil , according to industry newspaper variety .
