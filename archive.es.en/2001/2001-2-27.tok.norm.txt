blue circle industries , which operates outside dunbar in east lothian , says the process would also reduce the plant 's impact on the surrounding environment .
the firm is set to submit an application to the scottish environmental protection agency -lrb- sepa -rrb- in a bid to get approval for the process .
blue circle says it has conducted a successful trial with emission tests and kept local people informed about the process .
the east lothian firm wants to add scrap tyres , cut into chips , to the traditional mixture of coal and liquid fuel which it uses in concrete production .
in the application to sepa , the plant 's management said the process is more energy efficient , cheaper and less harmful to the environment .
management also argue that it will help to tackle the uk 's growing problem with disused car tyres .
if approval is granted up to four tonnes of rubber will be burned at the plant every hour .
it is estimated that 40m tonnes of tyres are scrapped in the uk every year .
they are either disposed of in landfill sites or dumped illegally .
blue circle says it will send a newsletter to local people and has promised to keep them informed about developments .
the company currently produces around 1m tonnes of cement each year .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- call to eliminate gender pay gap low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's rory cellan-jones " for women in full time work things have improved " real 56k tuesday , 27 february , 2001 , 07:04 gmt call to eliminate gender pay gap women workers still earn less than men three decades after equal pay legislation came into force in britain , women still receive significantly less pay than men , the equal opportunities commission has said .
its report , just pay , concludes that the long-term results of the pay gap are poverty , social exclusion , inadequate pensions and limited access to training .
the commission wants the gap to be halved within five years and completely eradicated within eight .
this is not something that we can be proud of professor joan stringer but the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- condemned the commission 's calls for employers to be forced to carry out pay reviews .
since the equal pay act was introduced in 1970 , the gap between average hours earnings for men and women in full-time work had narrowed from 31 % to 18 % , the report found .
but according to the commission the proportion of men 's full-time wages that women working part-time received had hardly altered .
the gap stood at 39 % , the widest gulf in any eu country , the commission found .
while professional women had seen their incomes rise , many others were trapped in low-paid , part-time jobs , the study found .
scotland 's gaping gulf scotland had the largest gap between men and women 's earnings .
here the gender earnings gap was 19 % - 1 % higher than the uk figure and 6 % higher than in wales .
the commission 's scotland commissioner , professor joan stringer , condemned the figures as " disgraceful " .
" low wages trap women in poverty and prevent them form acquiring new skills and preparing for retirement , " professor stringer said .
" the gap between men and women 's pay in scotland is wider than in britain as a whole and the british pay gap is the worst in europe .
" this is not something that we can be proud of , " she said .
the commission accused employers of complacency and called for new laws to force them to carry out pay reviews .
but the cbi said that would be ineffective and would impose an unnecessary and excessive burden on companies .

its report , just pay , concludes that the long-term results of the pay gap are poverty , social exclusion , inadequate pensions and limited access to training .
the commission wants the gap to be halved within five years and completely eradicated within eight .
this is not something that we can be proud of professor joan stringer but the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- condemned the commission 's calls for employers to be forced to carry out pay reviews .
since the equal pay act was introduced in 1970 , the gap between average hours earnings for men and women in full-time work had narrowed from 31 % to 18 % , the report found .
but according to the commission the proportion of men 's full-time wages that women working part-time received had hardly altered .
the gap stood at 39 % , the widest gulf in any eu country , the commission found .
while professional women had seen their incomes rise , many others were trapped in low-paid , part-time jobs , the study found .
scotland 's gaping gulf scotland had the largest gap between men and women 's earnings .
here the gender earnings gap was 19 % - 1 % higher than the uk figure and 6 % higher than in wales .
the commission 's scotland commissioner , professor joan stringer , condemned the figures as " disgraceful " .
" low wages trap women in poverty and prevent them form acquiring new skills and preparing for retirement , " professor stringer said .
" the gap between men and women 's pay in scotland is wider than in britain as a whole and the british pay gap is the worst in europe .
" this is not something that we can be proud of , " she said .
the commission accused employers of complacency and called for new laws to force them to carry out pay reviews .
but the cbi said that would be ineffective and would impose an unnecessary and excessive burden on companies .

the court hearing opened on monday as ms bhutto and her imprisoned husband , asif zardari , appealed against their 1999 conviction on charges of corruption .
a special high court bench three years ago found ms bhutto and her husband guilty of misusing their authority to award a multi-million dollar contract to a swiss firm .
they were sentenced to five-year jail terms with a ban on holding public office for seven years .
both ms bhutto and the present military government know that this is a crucial case that could have a direct bearing on the future politics in the country .
landmark decision if the supreme court overturns the lower court 's decision , it would pave the way for the former prime minister to end her self-imposed exile and return to the country .
for this reason , both sides have acquired the services of top lawyers to defend their respective positions in the case .
senior members of the government believe it is an open and shut case of corruption and are hoping the supreme court will reject the appeal .
ms bhutto 's lawyers are equally confident of winning , especially after a recent report in the sunday times newspaper in london which cast serious doubts on the integrity of one of the trial judges .
audio evidence the report was said to be based on audio tapes of telephone conversations between one of the judges who was conducting ms bhutto 's trial and two senior members of the previous government of nawaz sharif .
according to the newspaper , a former official of pakistan 's intelligence service had provided tapes .
ms bhutto 's lawyers asked the supreme court to admit the tapes as a fresh piece of evidence which they say would establish that the government tried to influence the outcome of the trial .
the supreme court asked state lawyers to reply to the defence demand by wednesday .
the presiding judge in the case said that the court would be available on tuesday , but that he would adjourn the proceedings if no lawyers were available .
the lawyers ' strike is to protest against military rule in the country , which has lasted more than a year now .

a tech journalist nearby asked : " i wonder which version of windows he 's running . "
" you can definitely see agendas on the panel " anti-trust expert william kovacic indeed , although journalists were barred from using laptops or even handheld computers in the courtroom , five of the seven judges hearing the appeal had laptops with them at the bench .
a line of court staff flanked the bench each with a laptop , all running some version of microsoft windows .
it is a sign of exactly how pervasive computers have become in daily life , and it is a reminder of the importance of the microsoft case .
legal eagles microsoft has its allies and detractors , but its place in the modern economy is undeniable .
its operating system runs the vast majority of personal computers in the world .
and if one still needed convincing about the importance of this case , one had only to cast a look around the courtroom .
several legal celebrities were there , including anti-trust expert robert bork , and ken starr , the former special prosecutor who led the impeachment of former president bill clinton .
both men helped high-trade tech group procomp file a brief supporting the us government 's case against microsoft .
both are also familiar with the court of appeals in washington , both having served as judges on the court .
reading the tea leaves once the hearing started , court watchers began taking score as the judges peppered both sides with withering questions .
anti-trust expert william kovacic said : " you can definitely see agendas on the panel . "
he was most surprised when chief judge harry edwards stepped out and challenged the basic underpinnings of the government 's case .
but the judges are very good at not tipping their hands , mr kovacic said .
however , after the morning questioning , he said it was still too early to tell which way the judges might be leaning .
they grilled both sides in kind .
judge david s tatel repeatedly questioned microsoft 's lawyers about their challenge of judge thomas penfield jackson 's findings in the case .
in particular , he said that judge jackson had determined that microsoft did not allow computer makers to delete the internet explorer icon from the windows desktop .
" i do n't see how you can get a reversal on that part of your case , " judge tatel said .
judging the judge but some of the judges expressed doubts about judge jackson 's findings .
" when i find factual findings very conclusionary with no citation , i do n't feel obligated to defer to them , " chief judge edwards even said in the afternoon session , adding , " they are n't gospel " .
the appeals court 's focus on judge jackson 's findings gives a hint at what could be fireworks on tuesday .
neither the government nor microsoft requested time to address judge jackson 's courtroom conduct and the statements he made after the trial , but the appeals court scheduled time to discuss these issues on the second day of hearings .
judge jackson has made several controversial comments following the trial that microsoft has quoted as an example of the judge 's alleged bias against the company .
ken auletta quoted judge jackson in the new yorker as saying that bill gates had a " napoleonic complex " .
mr kovacic said that this comment and others could become a factor in the case .
