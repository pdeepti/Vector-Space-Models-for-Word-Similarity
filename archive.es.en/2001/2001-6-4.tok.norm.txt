but the cavalry never arrived and the news soon filtered through that hauliers from north wales would not be returning to stanlow in cheshire .
hauliers and farmers had staged the latest protests in an effort to put the issue of fuel taxes back on the political agenda ahead of thursday 's general election .
' low morale ' protester mike greene , at the texaco refinery in pembroke dock , where truckers had considered staying until the general election , said he was angry and disappointed that they had been let down by the rest of the uk .

mr holloway added that the panic buying in wales had fizzled out .
a repeat of september 's panic fuel buying was feared a protester who had been at the stanlow site also said the weekend of action had been a success .
paul ashley said : " for a bunch of locals we have proved we can do it .
we have put fuel prices back on the government list . "
