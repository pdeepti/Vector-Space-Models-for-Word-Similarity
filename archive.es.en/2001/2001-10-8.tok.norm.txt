there were reports of heavy artillery and rocket exchanges during the night on the frontline just north of the capital kabul , which was a key target of the military strikes which began on sunday evening .
the taleban will not be able to resist opposition on the frontlines for more than two days dr abdullah abdullah , northern alliance one opposition member told the iranian state news agency irna that northern alliance forces were mustering all their strength for a major assault early on monday morning , when the country will start examining the level of devastation inflicted by the strikes .
many international observers , as well as the alliance itself , are hoping that the domestic opposition forces will be able to make full use of the opportunity provided by the us attacks to topple the militant taleban regime .
" our interest is to strengthen those forces that are opposed to the taleban leadership and to strengthen all those forces so that they will have better opportunities to prevail , " said us defence secretary donald rumsfeld .
the us has not laid out publicly the exact nature of its relationship with the northern alliance , although it has recently been revealed that both russia and iran are supplying their forces with weapons .
eyeing up kabul the alliance 's foreign minister dr abdullah abdullah confidently declared that the taleban might only survive a few more days , faced with a combination of strikes by international and domestic forces .
" we have reinforced our frontlines , " said dr abdullah .
" the taleban will not be able to resist opposition on the frontlines for more than two days . "
he also claimed to be in " constant contact " with the us and said that action " from now on " would be co-ordinated with washington .
earlier in the week , dr abdullah said he had met with us officials to discuss the prospect of military action .
correspondents say that the alliance will be looking to take control of the capital kabul , from which its members were forcibly ejected five years ago after the arrival of the taleban .
although buoyed by the us strikes and kept in arms by russia and iran , the northern alliance is considerably weaker than the taleban , and controls no more than 10 % of the country .
just prior to the 11 september attacks , it also lost its leader and figurehead - ahmad shah massoud - who was killed after being lured into a trap by an enemy .
the taleban regime is estimated to have some 40,000 troops at its disposal , while the northern alliance is thought to count between 12,000 and 15,000 .
but it is hoping for mass defections from enemy lines as the taleban weakens .
some northern alliance sources believe that as many as 10,000 taleban fighters are now ready to switch their allegiances .
history lessons the alliance has already formulated plans for a post-taleban administration with the country 's former king , mohammad zahir shah , an 86-year-old who has been living in exile in rome .
but many of those now involved in the alliance disappointed ordinary afghans when they were in power , following the soviet withdrawal , by their failure to stop in-fighting and allegations of corruption and cronyism .
correspondents point out further that they were not noted for their respect for human rights .
they do however pursue a milder version of islam which includes allowing women to be educated and to work .

academics in leicester said their study shows young workers 40 years ago felt pressurised to get more training and found it difficult to work with older colleagues .
the study began after staff found hundreds of interviews with young workers , stretching back to 1962 , as they cleared out old offices .
the team now hopes to trace workers who took part in the original research to create a unique history of employment .
work pressures " it 's assumed that the 60s was a golden age of british industry where there were lots of jobs available , it was easy to get work and jobs were relatively stress-free , " said dr john goodwin a lecturer at the centre for labour market studies at the university .
workers face similar difficulties in today 's era " in fact workers faced similar difficulties to the ones they have now and found work stressful .
" there was pressure to get more training because people who had stayed on at school or had taken an apprenticeship were seen to be in a better position .
" we think of lifelong learning as starting in the 1990s but it has been happening since the 60s .
" there was also pressure in the workplace in the 1960s as young people just out of school found it difficult to get along with work colleagues who were 15 years old . "
researchers claim the work will lead to a reappraisal of employment history 40 years ago .
the study comes after a re-analysis of nearly 900 interviews of 15 and 16-year-olds , conducted between 1962-64 , which were found by staff clearing out disused offices at the centre last year .
the teenagers took part in a government-funded project studying the attitudes of young people in the work place , which had been archived at the university .
' unique history ' researchers arel appealing for those who took part in the original project to get in touch so a record of their complete employment history can be put together .
" if we can trace 200 of the original group we will be able to create a unique history of an individual 's employment from leaving school to retirement , " said dr goodwin " we will be able look at the importance of decisions made in early life on careers and what affect qualifications had .
" there has been a lot of debate about the contribution to the labour market of people in their fifties .

everything went like a finely-oiled machine us bomber pilot targets included early warning radars , surface-to-air missiles , airfields , aircraft , military command and control installations and terrorist camps .
in one case , taleban military equipment including tanks was struck near mazar-e-sharif in northern afghanistan , officials said .
bombers the attacks were spearheaded by us and british cruise missiles fired from naval vessels in the arabian sea , and included long-range bombers flying from bases in the us and aircraft flying from carriers in the region .
one senior administration official said the military strikes would be sustained and would last at least a few days .
mr rumsfeld said 15 bombers , including b-2 stealth bombers flying direct from the us , 25 strike aircraft and 50 tomahawk cruise missiles had been used .
the b-2s dropped their satellite-guided bombs and continued on to diego garcia , a british island in the indian ocean .
b-52 bombers dropped dozens of 500lb bombs on al-qaeda terrorist training camps in eastern afghanistan , one us official said .
pilot in a press conference organised by the pentagon , one of the us pilots who flew over afghanistan said " everything went like a finely-oiled machine " .
the us officer added : " we did n't encounter any threats we were n't equipped to deal with " and said the experience had been less demanding than training exercises .
cruise missiles - typically used for precise targetting of key installations - can travel for hundreds of miles using their own navigation and global positioning systems .
after being dropped from a b-52 bomber or shot from a vessel at sea , the missile 's wings , tail and engine inlet fold out from its body and it flies a low , zig-zag route to avoid detection by enemy radar .
once the missile hits its target it detonates a 1,000lb warhead .
the us military says that the missile is 90 % accurate , but there is no independent verification of this figure .
b-2 stealth bombers the b-2 is a heavy bomber with stealth features - technologies that make military machines less easy to detect with radar .
b-2s from whiteman air force base in missouri , diego garcia and guam can cover the whole world with only one mid-air refuelling .
the scale of the strikes is so far limited by comparison with previous operations against iraq or yugoslavia , but military analysts say there is only a relatively small number of conventional military targets to hit .
the taleban forces and those of bin laden are largely a guerrilla army , with a few tanks and aeroplanes , and no sophisticated system of defence installations .
taleban military power depends much less on such things than on the passion of their fighting men and their ability to live off the land .
afghanistan is a rugged , largely inhospitable country , whose land communications are severely hampered by the mountainous terrain which occupies much of its territory , especially in the centre and north-east .
the taleban will be hoping to weather the attack as afghans did the soviet invasion of the 1980s .
clear focus the bbc 's afghanistan correspondent kate clarke says they have been redeploying troops , massing soldiers in strategic towns , relying less now on local soldiers who they fear might defect and depending more on the hard core taleban .
these are soldiers from their heartland in the south and the foreign militants , arabs , pakistanis and central asians .
superpowers of the past - from imperial britain to the soviet union - have found that military involvement in afghanistan is full of danger .
but the aim of the current military action is more limited than earlier british and soviet military campaigns .
by limiting their military objectives to the fight against bin laden , his network and his taleban hosts , the us and its allies will be seeking to ensure that their actions are seen as proportionate , but also that their campaign remains clearly focused and achievable .

the us officer added : " we did n't encounter any threats we were n't equipped to deal with " and said the experience had been less demanding than training exercises .
cruise missiles - typically used for precise targetting of key installations - can travel for hundreds of miles using their own navigation and global positioning systems .
after being dropped from a b-52 bomber or shot from a vessel at sea , the missile 's wings , tail and engine inlet fold out from its body and it flies a low , zig-zag route to avoid detection by enemy radar .
once the missile hits its target it detonates a 1,000lb warhead .
the us military says that the missile is 90 % accurate , but there is no independent verification of this figure .
b-2 stealth bombers the b-2 is a heavy bomber with stealth features - technologies that make military machines less easy to detect with radar .
b-2s from whiteman air force base in missouri , diego garcia and guam can cover the whole world with only one mid-air refuelling .
afghanistan has suffered more than 20 years of war the scale of the strikes is so far limited by comparison with previous operations against iraq or yugoslavia , but military analysts say there is only a relatively small number of conventional military targets to hit .
the taleban forces and those of bin laden are largely a guerrilla army , with a few tanks and aeroplanes , and no sophisticated system of defence installations .
taleban military power depends much less on such things than on the passion of their fighting men and their ability to live off the land .
afghanistan is a rugged , largely inhospitable country , whose land communications are severely hampered by the mountainous terrain which occupies much of its territory , especially in the centre and north-east .
the taleban will be hoping to weather the attack as afghans did the soviet invasion of the 1980s .
clear focus the bbc 's afghanistan correspondent kate clarke says they have been redeploying troops , massing soldiers in strategic towns , relying less now on local soldiers who they fear might defect and depending more on the hard core taleban .
these are soldiers from their heartland in the south and the foreign militants , arabs , pakistanis and central asians .
superpowers of the past - from imperial britain to the soviet union - have found that military involvement in afghanistan is full of danger .
but the aim of the current military action is more limited than earlier british and soviet military campaigns .
by limiting their military objectives to the fight against bin laden , his network and his taleban hosts , the us and its allies will be seeking to ensure that their actions are seen as proportionate , but also that their campaign remains clearly focused and achievable . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's david shukman describes the military hardware used in the attacks the loya jirga political healing what is a loya jirga ?

mr bourne will tell the tory conference in blackpool that the party must consult widely as it looks for vote-winning ideas .
the conservatives have a poor election record in wales - having failed to win a single mp 's seat for the second time at the june general election .
assembly : the tories are looking to the next elections however , four months after that failure , the tories are looking ahead to their next encounter with the voters - the welsh assembly elections in may 2003 .
their assembly leader nick bourne announced a policy review at last year 's party conference .
on monday , as tory delegates meet in blackpool at a conference shortened by the international situation , he will launch another one .
the party 's eight assembly members will hold a meeting on the conference fringe to thrash out fresh ideas .
mr bourne , who supported former tory chancellor ken clarke in the recent leadership election , said the tories can unite behind their new leader .
however , iain duncan smith is much further to the right than his assembly counterpart .
devolution debate meanwhile , devolution has been wiped off the conservative conference agenda after the party cut its annual gathering by a day in response to the terrorist attacks on the united states .
party members in blackpool had been scheduled to debate " devolution , diversity and decentralisation " on thursday morning .
but the agenda has been rewritten after the tories decided to close the conference on wednesday .
other topics have been rescheduled but the devolution debate has fallen victim to the new schedule . watch / listen on this story bbc wales 's david cornock reports " amid the seaside amusements , the tories are looking ahead " news and analysis see also : 07 oct 01 -pipe- conservatives drop thatcher , duncan smith urged 07 oct 01 -pipe- conservatives duncan smith 's iraq terror warning 06 oct 01 -pipe- uk politics tories deny ignoring black vote 05 oct 01 -pipe- conservatives tories ' crisis conference 13 sep 01 -pipe- uk politics rebel 's rise to the top internet links : conservative party the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : soap actor killed in holiday fall wales leads uk bust firms league husband jailed for rape attack festival town prepares for euros plea for more kidney donors rowing team arrives back in uk families opt for single jabs hain turns fire on greens links to more wales stories are at the foot of the page .

at the serena hotel , home to a large community of foreign journalists who had been waiting for just that moment , the attacks came as somewhat of a surprise .
a large contingent of police and anti terrorist forces were in the hotel grounds , patrolling and standing in heavily armed groups .
ostensibly , they were there to protect the reporters and camera crews .
but as was quickly shown , the officers were also under orders to control the movement of journalists .
they did n't always succeed .
some people scaled the wall around the hotel and ventured onto the largely quiet streets of the city .
there was no sign of any reaction to the raids on afghanistan .
expected reaction in recent days , a number of islamic radical political parties have been demonstrating in quetta , opposing plans for american lead military strikes , and supporting for the taleban .
the expectation is that those groups will attempt to demonstrate on monday , but equally that the pakistani authorities will stop them .
kandahar lies 240 kilometres north of quetta , across a rugged range of mountains and through two tracts of desert .
a man living to the west of the city told bbc reporters that he had seen two planes flying high overhead just before the bombing of kandahar .
calls to the afghan city , a local call from quetta , despite being across an international border , produced mixed results .
only government officials have working phones at the moment , and all played down reports of bombing , missiles and damage .
eyewitness reports a civilian who lives near the main border crossing said there had been up to 30 explosions at the kandahar airport , but another man working at the taleban aviation centre said far fewer blasts had been heard .
that man said a fire blazing near the runway as burning grass .
a taleban diplomat in quetta said no significant targets had been hit .
in truth , until day breaks and some independent information emerges from afghanistan , credible information will be in short supply .
it is very likely that large numbers of people are moving towards the border from kandahar , the much feared refugee exodus of recent weeks .
those people may be able to shed light on what happened during the first wave of attacks on their country by american-lead forces in the " war against terror " .
the moment dreaded by many afghans , aid agencies and those worried about the long-term impact of yet more violence against afghanistan has begun .
whether it is the first strike in a successful campaign against terrorism , or the beginning of a long period of instability in this blighted region to be seen .

the attacks on 11 september have renewed a debate on access to information on the internet .
the us government , some organisations and some commercial sites are removing or modifying information on their websites for fear that the information might be used to launch other attacks .
being ' responsible citizens ' the federation of american scientists ' -lrb- fas -rrb- website has a wealth of information on the us military and intelligence .
steven aftergood , a senior research analyst who concentrates on government secrecy and intelligence said since 11 september , fas removed or modified a number of pages from its site including the locations and layout of intelligence facilities and some detailed information about nuclear weapons facilities abroad .
" we are just trying to be responsible citizens .
september 11 was an earthquake in national security policy , " he said .
the attacks again raised the issue of the balance between civil liberties and security in an open , democratic society , and 11 september has radically changed the debate .
" the balance has necessarily shifted .
if there are people among us who are intent on committing spectacular mass murders , then obviously our conduct of public life has to be adjusted accordingly in order to protect civil liberties , " he said .
" much of my work has been oriented towards resisting the possibility of government overreaching and official abuse of power , but that hypothetical threat pales to what has actually taken place . "
difficult debates the attacks have caused many organisations to go through a wrenching debate as they re-evaluate what should be publicly available on the internet .
omb watch provides easy access to several publicly available government databases with a focus on environmental issues .
their sites allow users to enter their postal codes and find out about chemical plants and toxic chemical releases in their areas , but some fear that the information could be used by terrorists .
omb watch executive director gary bass said in a statement : " i was surprised in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks to receive hostile e-mail .
one individual wondered ' how much blood will be on your hands for posting ' information about environmental dangers . "
after much internal discussion about the responsibility of publishing the information on the internet , they decided that it would be irresponsible to take down the databases , mr bass said .
" the information may not only aid and abet terrorists , as we have been accused of , but it also lets workers and people protect themselves from dangers in their communities , " he said .
government offline omb watch has also been tracking the amount of information that government websites have removed in the wake of the attacks .
the environmental protection agency has removed risk management plans from their website .
the plans provide information about the dangers of chemical accidents and how to prevent them , according to omb watch .
the department of transportation " has discontinued providing open access to the national pipeline mapping system -lrb- npms -rrb- .
recent events have focused additional security concerns on critical infrastructure systems , " according to its website .
the agency for toxic substances and disease registry has removed a report from its website on chemical site security .
the national imagery and mapping agency has suspended all sales of maps of military installations as well as its most detailed maps of other us locations .
several other government agencies including the federal aviation administration , the bureau of transportation statistics , the internal revenue service and the nuclear regulatory commission -lrb- nrc -rrb- have also removed information from their sites .
like many government agencies , the nrc is reviewing the information on its website , said spokeswoman rosetta virgilio .
" we have a team of folks looking at it , looking at information that terrorists might be interested in , " she said .
site shuttered but some sites have been the first casualties of the new war on terrorism .
travis towle remembers watching a news report about the possibility that the government might seize the assets of some internet companies with links to terrorism .
mr towle operates a streaming media company in topeka kansas , and his company hosted a site called ira radio.com , " a web site which is for irish news & media coverage with regard to the ongoing british presence in the occupied six counties of ireland with a view toward correcting misrepresentations . "
the morning after seeing the news report , he received a call from his internet service providers .
they were concerned that their assets might be seized , and they did not want to be a test case , mr towle said .
after speaking with the advisory board of his company , he decided to take down the site .
" everybody has a right to free speech , but the problem comes down to cash , " he said .
their attorneys said it would take up to $ 500,000 to argue the case , and the fledgling company did not want to risk the five years of work they had spent building it into a viable business .
in three months , they will reassess the situation , and they hope to quietly relaunch the site .

the visit was aimed at improving relations soured by rows over japan 's military past and concerns over plans to change rules governing the actions of japan 's self-defence force .
i felt again the horror of war junichiro koizumi japan plans to bring in new laws by the end of the month to allow it to prove logistical support to us-led military action in afghanistan .
but it wants to convince its neighbours that the changes do not mean a revival of japan 's military ambitions .
during monday 's visit mr koizumi laid a wreath at a chinese war memorial and visited a museum dedicated to china 's wartime resistance against japan .
" looking at this museum , i felt again the horror of war , " he told reporters .
" i looked at the various exhibits with a feeling of heartfelt apology and condolences for those chinese people who were victims of aggression .
" we must not go to war again .
" is n't that the best response to those who fell in the calamity of war ? "
regional row in recent months , china has accused japan of increasing militarism .
first , the japanese government approved a history textbook which china and south korea says glosses over japan 's wartime atrocities .
then , in august , mr koizumi visited a controversial war shrine that honours convicted war criminals among japan 's war dead .
mr koizumi was to meet china 's president jiang zemin and premier zhu rongji during the visit , which came soon after the us and uk launched air strikes on afghanistan in retaliation for the 11 september attacks on new york city and washington .
before leaving japan , mr koizumi once again expressed support for the military action .
he plans to visit south korea on 15 october , also to repair damaged relations following the textbook row and his visit to the yasukuni shrine , which south korea opposed .
seoul finally agreed to the visit by mr koizumi after months of negotiations and rejections .
the two countries are co-hosting next year 's football world cup .

bbc news -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- ni assembly : does it work ?
categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : northern ireland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 8 october , 2001 , 07:42 gmt 08:42 uk ni assembly : does it work ?
with the northern ireland assembly again on the brink of collapse , bbc news online 's dominic casciani looks at what it has done for ordinary people .
devolution to northern ireland came shortly after the labour government in london created the scottish parliament in edinburgh and the national assembly for wales in cardiff .
in northern ireland , security has remained in the hands of the secretary of state , but the power-sharing body at stormont has wide legislative powers over myriad areas of life , principally education , health , agriculture , environment , employment and social and economic development .
for three decades , northern ireland office civil servants performed those functions , leading to the so-called democratic deficit at the heart of public life .
but has the assembly and other institutions delivered a democratic dividend ?
when the 12 ministers from the four parties first sat down together in 1999 they were charged with two initial goals for the administration : agree a programme for government agree and distribute departmental budgets so how have the ministers discharged their duties ?
one of the real winners has been the leader-designate of the nationalist sdlp mark durkan .
early on he won the trust of all parties with his handling of the budget and negotiations with the treasury .
from day one , unionists regarded the appointment of sinn fein 's martin mcguinness to education as controversial .
one of his first major decisions was to scrap school league tables .
but he has also tackled the 11-plus , a long-standing source of grievance which nio civil servants had not addressed during direct rule .
mr mcguinness 's decision is due on 15 october - something that will be kicked in to the long grass if the institutions collapse .
health trouble his party colleague holding the health portfolio , bairbre de brun , has had a more difficult ride .
ni assembly facts 108 members 12 ministers 21 acts passed 1998 : formally created nov 1999 : established feb 2000 : suspended may 2000 : resumed work her decision over the location of belfast 's maternity hospital led to accusations that she chose a site better suited to her constituent 's needs than the city 's .
northern ireland also has some of the worst waiting lists and illness rates in the uk , and the minister has been under pressure to make inroads .
the anti-agreement democratic unionists have continued to hold two ministerial posts despite officially refusing to sit in the executive with sinn fein .
peter robinson and nigel dodds initially held regional development and social development .
many observers regarded them as being not only capable , but also thoroughly enjoying the role .
but their party also complains of a lack of collective responsibility within the executive because the ministers can theoretically set policy irrespective of key agreed goals .
the party 's critics say the dup has not helped that situation by officially refusing to sit in the executive with sinn fein .
by far the most popular decision has been to introduce free public transport for pensioners but this became mired in a minor behind-the-scenes row over which minister should take the credit .
success or failure ?
dr rick wilford of queen 's university in belfast said that there were many problems with the assembly , but it had pulled off two significant achievements .
there is no social contract between the politicians and the community - political difficulties and events beyond stormont intrude dr rick wilford " mark durkan 's capacity to get ministers to agree a budget has been quite commendable , " said dr wilford .
" indeed , the capacity of the ministers to put together a programme for government , given the inherent structural flaws of the assembly 's mechanisms , has been quite remarkable . "
however , dr wilford said that he doubted whether many of the members -lrb- mlas -rrb- were capable of the role .
" the committees have taken their time to find their feet , " he said .
" in many cases the chairs of committees have not made the most of their role in scrutinising departments .
tribal politics the assembly 's flaws were being compounded by the tribal nature of northern ireland 's parties where allegiances are more important than policy decisions , he added .
critics say that this is most obvious in the office of first minister and deputy first minister , posts held by the uup and sdlp .
not only do the two largest parties hold these posts , they also dominate the committee charged with scrutinising the work of these two senior ministers .
" part of the problem is that northern ireland 's parties are so dominated by their leaders that they really have no role for the backbencher , " said dr wilford .
" many of the mlas must unlearn a lot of what they consider to be their identity and party interests .
" there is no social contract between the politicians and the community .
political difficulties and events beyond stormont intrude and we see sectarian point after point being made in debates . "
openness and public awareness dr liz fawcett of the university of ulster has been monitoring the media and public awareness impact of the assembly .
it 's arguable that there has been a real lack of confidence among mlas because they do not want the public to think that they are ignorant dr liz fawcett she attacked stormont for excessive secrecy after finding that a large proportion of committee hearings were behind closed doors .
her findings caused a media storm and , anecdotally , appear to have needled committees into being more open .
" while scotland and wales have been committed to openness from the word go , this has not happened at stormont , " said dr fawcett .
" it 's arguable that there has been a real lack of confidence among mlas because they do not want the public to think that they are ignorant . "
dr fawcett identified the role of the presiding officer , stormont 's equivalent of the house of commons speaker , as problematic .
the current holder , lord alderdice of the alliance party , has adopted a policy of not talking to the media because of the political necessity to be seen as impartial .
this decision and others such as the lack of publicly available information on the assembly 's website or elsewhere , dr fawcett argues , has not helped public awareness .
" people do n't fully realise the democratic potential of the system , " she said .
" there 's a degree of haziness of the role of the assembly which has been compounded after an initial novelty value wore off . "

the scottish national party said ministers must " retain an open mind " when deciding on the future structure of the industry in the immediate aftermath of the bankruptcy .
railtrack was put into administration on sunday after the government refused to put any more money into the struggling company .
a high court order has been granted which places control of the rail network in the hands of government-appointed administrators .
railtrack 's shares have now be suspended and there is a possibility that the company 's shareholders may get little , or possibly none , of their money back .
no job losses have been announced and it is expected that rail services will be unaffected .
news of the collapse prompted criticism of the government 's transport policy from the scottish national party .
the party 's transport spokesman andrew wilson said : " everyone associated with the railways except the government has argued for years that the current structure was unsustainable .
" railtrack is a creature of the bizarre form of privatisation undertaken by the tories and supported by labour in government .
public investment " it has failed and we have to move on quickly .
" we need to look in detail at the government 's proposed alternative but what is vital is that they recognise the need to maximise investment in rail at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer and the travelling public .
" the snp has supported the use of a not for profit trust approach to public investment in a number of areas .
everyone associated with the railways except the government has argued for years that the current structure was unsustainable andrew wilson , snp " labour dismissed our idea and the fact that they look likely to now adopt it has to be welcomed .
" given the recognised problems in the industry and the reality that railway investment has much wider benefits for the economy , some form of public ownership is critical .
" the government should retain an open mind about the correct structure and listen to passengers , workers and the industry in coming to their conclusion . "
earlier this year railtrack said several new projects in scotland had been put on hold due to financial problems .
improved links to the borders and glasgow airport were the main casualties of the company 's massive debt problems .

the ceremony - american tv 's biggest awards of the year - were due to take place on sunday , 7 october .
it was not a day to celebrate les moonves head of cbs television they were due to be broadcast live from los angeles and new york after being postponed from their original mid-september date , in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the us .
organisers must now decide whether to reschedule the ceremony yet again or cancel it .
" we 're not at this point calling it a cancellation .
we 're looking at all the options , " said bryce zabel , chairman of the academy of television arts and sciences .
" this is n't about dollars .
this is about doing the right thing . "
the awards had been scheduled to take place amid unprecedented security measures .
the organisers had sought to create a night of muted celebration , asking participants to cut back on red-carpet arrival fanfare and forgo showy gowns and tuxedoes in favour of business attire .
the decision to call sunday 's show off was taken after heads of the major tv networks consulted each other .
" there was a general feeling of people feeling uncomfortable .
it was not a day to celebrate , certainly , " head of cbs television les moonves said .
" it was the community really coming together and expressing the feeling that it would be the wrong thing to do this , to come together tonight . "
high-profile stars and shows also expressed their desire that the show should not go ahead , he said .
" i did not speak to one person today from the community who was passionate about going on .
" this is the toughest decision i 've ever been involved in .
this is television .
it 's really small potatoes compared to what 's going on out there in the world . "
the three-hour ceremony , watched by millions across america , had originally been due to take place on 16 september .
but they were postponed because of national mourning following the attacks on new york and washington .
if officially cancelled , it will be the first time the awards have been scrapped in their 53-year history .
the only other time the emmys have been affected by world events was in 1978 , when the ceremony was delayed by half an hour because then president jimmy carter announced the camp david accords .

the meeting comes as research commissioned by the charity voluntary service overseas -lrb- vso -rrb- shows that 79 % of britons think the government should make sure people in poor countries have more access to drugs for hiv related illnesses .
the public wants the government to take action to make sure this happens vso spokesman the research found 87 % of people felt it would be better if people living with hiv / aids in developing countries paid less for medicines than the prices charged in the uk .
it also found that 79 % of people wanted the uk government to take action to reduce drug prices in poor countries .
strength of feeling a spokesman for vso , which works through volunteers in 74 of the world 's poorest countries , said : " the strength of feeling took us by surprise .
" the public not only think medicines should be cheaper in developing countries but they also want the government to take action to make sure this happens . "
the charity warned that millions of people in the developing world were denied treatment because of the cost of medicines .
the spokesman highlighted the case of the drug fluconazole , which is used to treat an often fatal form of hiv / aids-related meningitis .
he said : " a month 's course costs about £ 270 in both kenya and in the uk , where it is paid for by the nhs .
" this is more than the £ 236 the average kenyan earns in a year and takes this drug completely out of the reach of the vast majority of kenyans , who have to buy their own medicines .
" in terms of relative salary , this would be as if someone in the uk had to personally pay around £ 17,000 every month for this vital medicine . "
blueprint the charity has drawn up a blueprint called street price in an effort to encourage decision-makers to tackle the crisis .
if implemented , the framework would include a database of low prices to promote competition , a global forum for developing countries to negotiate the lowest charges and price caps to keep costs down .
vso said simple mechanisms , such as different packaging and different colour tablets , could be put in place to make sure cheap drugs sold to poor countries did not flow back illegally into britain .
vso chief executive mark goldring said : " we urge our government to take a lead in promoting a global framework for low drug prices , in which companies from all countries compete to drive prices down . "

the meeting comes as research commissioned by the charity voluntary service overseas -lrb- vso -rrb- shows that 79 % of britons think the government should make sure people in poor countries have more access to drugs for hiv related illnesses .
the public wants the government to take action to make sure this happens vso spokesman the research found 87 % of people felt it would be better if people living with hiv / aids in developing countries paid less for medicines than the prices charged in the uk .
it also found that 79 % of people wanted the uk government to take action to reduce drug prices in poor countries .
strength of feeling a spokesman for vso , which works through volunteers in 74 of the world 's poorest countries , said : " the strength of feeling took us by surprise .
" the public not only think medicines should be cheaper in developing countries but they also want the government to take action to make sure this happens . "
the charity warned that millions of people in the developing world were denied treatment because of the cost of medicines .
the spokesman highlighted the case of the drug fluconazole , which is used to treat an often fatal form of hiv / aids-related meningitis .
he said : " a month 's course costs about £ 270 in both kenya and in the uk , where it is paid for by the nhs .
" this is more than the £ 236 the average kenyan earns in a year and takes this drug completely out of the reach of the vast majority of kenyans , who have to buy their own medicines .
" in terms of relative salary , this would be as if someone in the uk had to personally pay around £ 17,000 every month for this vital medicine . "
blueprint the charity has drawn up a blueprint called street price in an effort to encourage decision-makers to tackle the crisis .
if implemented , the framework would include a database of low prices to promote competition , a global forum for developing countries to negotiate the lowest charges and price caps to keep costs down .
vso said simple mechanisms , such as different packaging and different colour tablets , could be put in place to make sure cheap drugs sold to poor countries did not flow back illegally into britain .
vso chief executive mark goldring said : " we urge our government to take a lead in promoting a global framework for low drug prices , in which companies from all countries compete to drive prices down . "
