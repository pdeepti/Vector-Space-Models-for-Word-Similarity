china has repeatedly expressed its opposition to the united states ' plan for missile defence , saying such a system could spark a new arms race . "
talking china out of its trenchant opposition to nmd is going to be tough . "
james kelly 's trip to china is part of a world-wide effort by the bush administration to allay international suspicion of the american plan for the so-called son of star wars system .
his talks with senior chinese officials are scheduled to last only a day , and before they got under way , mr kelly said he would try to assuage the concerns that china has expressed .
shared goals he said curbing the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction was a key element in maintaining peace and stability in east asia , and that this goal was something china shared with the united sates .
mr kelly is new to his job ; it is his first trip to china as assistant secretary of state , and talking china out of its trenchant opposition to nmd is going to be tough .
china is deeply suspicious of the planned missile defence system , and has said so many times .
china strategists believe the system would render china 's own missiles ineffective , and would undermine its strategic position in asia .
poor relations they say an american missile shield will spark a new arms race in asia , and some hard-line analysts here believe that missile defence is specifically designed to counter china 's military modernisation and its growing regional power .
diplomats say the chinese side is also offended that the americans have not sent someone more senior to talk to them about missile defence , and mr kelly 's task is further complicated by the fact that relations between the us and china are at a low point .
last month 's spy plane crisis and mr bush 's commitment to sell a sizeable package of weapons to taiwan have soured the atmosphere in which these talks are going to take place .
gary milholin , of us arms control think-tank , the wisconsin project , told the bbc : " mr kelly can hope at least to show that the us has not ignored china .
" he will say that missile defence is not directed at china , it is directed at rogue states such as iran , iraq and north korea who may some day have missiles to hit the us . "

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- cjd scientists warn of ' second wave ' low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's pallab ghosh " the number of deaths has steadily increased " real 56k tuesday , 15 may , 2001 , 05:27 gmt 06:27 uk cjd scientists warn of ' second wave ' by bbc news online 's helen briggs scientists are warning that the predicted size of the variant cjd epidemic may have been underestimated .
research in mice suggests that only people with the shortest incubation periods for the disease are showing symptoms of the human form of bse .
this study reminds us that we can not be complacent about the potential risks to public health posed by bse john collinge , mrc prion unit , london if confirmed , the findings would mean that the current cases are just the tip of the iceberg and that a " second wave " of cases will emerge .
projections of the scale of the epidemic are based on the theory that some people are unlikely to contract cjd from infected meat because of their genetic make-up .
this idea is contradicted by research reported in the scientific journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
" those patients we have seen so far with vcjd may be those genetically disposed to have the shortest incubation periods , " said john collinge , director of the medical research council prion unit in london .
genetic risk prions are infectious agents that cause fatal brain diseases such as vcjd in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse -rrb- and scrapie in animals .
following infection , there is a very long incubation period before symptoms of the disease occur .
according to the latest figures from the department of health , 99 cases of vcjd have been recorded to date in humans .
prions cause fatal degenerative brain diseases but it remains unclear how many other people have been exposed to bse and what proportion of these will eventually develop the human form of the disease .
one clue is our genes .
as with conditions like cancer and heart disease , genetic factors are thought to be involved in determining an individual 's risk of developing cjd , after exposure to the infective agent .
all patients identified so far have a particular variation in their genetic make-up -lrb- mm -rrb- , shared by about 40 % of white britons .
two other subtypes -lrb- vv and mv -rrb- are seen .
the current estimates assume that only people with the mm genetic make-up will contract the disease if they come into contact with the infective agent , for example by eating contaminated meat .
' complacent ' however , professor collinge , who led the team that carried out the new research , warns that such predictions may be " overly optimistic " .
" this study reminds us that we can not be complacent about the potential risks to public health posed by bse , " says professor collinge .
" we can not rule out an epidemic that evolves over decades . "
the new work confirms that in mice at least , a number of genes are involved in susceptibility to prion diseases .
and although it may take longer for symptoms to appear in some animals because of their genetic make-up , that does not mean they will not eventually succumb to the disease .
as the mouse and human genomes are so similar , corresponding genes are almost certain to be found in humans .

un relief co-ordinator carolyn mcaskie told a meeting of the un security council that the political and military situation in liberia is deteriorating rapidly .
she said she had found a growing despair there on a recent visit to west africa , and this contrasted with moves towards ending the civil war in neighbouring sierra leone .
charles taylor is accused of fuelling the war in sierra leone " there was a nervousness in the air , and the sense was that the political and military situation was rapidly deteriorating , " she said .
fighting along the borders of sierra leone , guinea and liberia broke out late last year , forcing hundreds of thousands to flee their homes and refugee camps .
mutual accusations both guinea and liberia accuse the other of being behind rebel attacks into their countries .
ms mcaskie emphasised that peace could only be restored to the region if the instability in the three neighbouring countries was tackled together .
a ban on liberia 's diamond experts and travel by top officials took effect last week after the security council decided liberia had not completely cut ties with the rebels in sierra leone .
the council has accused liberian president charles taylor of selling guns to sierra leone 's rebels in exchange for an illegal diamond trade .
but ms mcaskie said the sanctions only increased liberia 's isolation and make it more difficult for the country to receive aid .

the stars of the bolshoi ballet have descended on london for a four-week run with a weekly changing programme .
there were tepid reviews for its first week , which featured excerpts from swan lake , don quixote and giselle among others , but reviewers were confident that things would get better .
but the feeling was that the second programme at the theatre royal , drury lane , the overall feeling did not reach another level .
the first act opened with the choreographic composition chopiniana , featuring the corps de ballet .
well , not quite featuring , but on the stage they were .
this was hardly a set piece to show off their talents .
though the principal dancers carried off the performance with a certain poise , there appeared to be a lack of precision .
the music by chopin was superbly played by the orchestra but there was no magic to draw you into the performance on the stage .
the second half was divertissement - six classic pieces - four of which were pas de deuxs .
the sleeping beauty , danced by anna antonicheva and andrei uvarov , was the first and set the tone for the rest of the evening .
the couple danced well separately , but together there was no chemistry , leading to a feeling of awkwardness .
romeo and juliet was the biggest disappointment , as it played out a scene which was totally unrecognisable as the tragic love story .
there was a detached air coming from the principals .
the prokofiev score , which at times is so emotive and rousing , came off as muted and low-key , played out on a stark , brightly-lit stage .
the performance as a whole had unevenness to it , with flashes of greatness combined with faults that jarred the highlight of the show was the narcissus solo from gennady yanin .
the athleticism with which it was performed left the audience breathless , and the lighting effect lent an eerie feel to the stage .
the brilliance of his choreography and execution overshadowed the rest of the show .
the evening was rounded off with a pretty average pas de deux performance of le corsaire .
the performance as a whole had unevenness to it , with flashes of greatness combined with jarring faults .
and the pieces were seamed together badly .
because these were " the stars " of the bolshoi company , each piece ended with applause , led by the dancers .
this became a formula for short bursts of dance , with the audience feeling compelled to clap .
as a showcase for the talents of the bolshoi this was a disappointment and left me wishing for a full-length ballet to entrance me .

an excavation near ashgabat , the capital of turkmenistan , revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that seems to have been used as a stamp seal .
the discovery suggests that central asia had a civilisation comparable with that of mesopotamia and ancient iran as far back as the bronze age , university of pennsylvania archaeologist fredrik hiebert told the bbc .
the area had been studied by soviet archaeologists before , but had been inaccessible to western researchers until recently , he said .
the ancient society is believed to have herded goats , grown crops and made bronze tools and ceramics , all some 300 years after the pyramids of egypt were built .
name unknown it is not known what the people of the civilisation called themselves , so researchers have dubbed the society the bactria margiana archaeology complex -lrb- b-mac -rrb- , after the ancient greek names for the two regions it covers .
the recent findings suggest that the region - which became the heart of the silk road from china to the west 2,000 years later - was integrated into surrounding societies centuries earlier than previously believed .
archaeologists have uncovered " monumental structures " , including multi-roomed mud brick buildings like apartment complexes .
mr hiebert discovered the stamp seal in june of last year and presented it at seminars at the university of pennsylvania and harvard university in the past week .
it is believed to date from 2300 bc , at a time when literate civilisations existed in mesopotamia , iran , and the indus river valley .
the symbols on the seal may be related to ancient chinese , but china is not believed to have developed writing at the time the artefact was made .
