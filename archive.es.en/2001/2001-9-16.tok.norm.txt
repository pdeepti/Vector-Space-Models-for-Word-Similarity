one of the suspects named by us investigators is an egyptian , mohamed atta .
he is said to have been a member of a team which steered hijacked airliners into the twin towers of the world trade center and the pentagon in washington .
so far , very little is known about atta , other than that he had studied at a university in germany , and had taken flying lessons in florida .
in egypt , his name is associated with neither of the two militant islamic organisations , which have operated in the country during the last 20 years .
the two groups , jihad and gamaa islamiya , are currently inactive in egypt .
but both have been linked to saudi dissident osama bin laden , the man suspected by the united states of having masterminded the attacks .
leaders from the two organisations , along with dozens of their men have gravitated to afghanistan where many have joined mr bin laden .
right hand man the saudi dissident 's right-hand man , according to some reports is ayman el zawahri , an egyptian doctor who also heads the externally-based faction of jihad .
mr el zawahri is described as a man of extensive experience , who has worked from an early age with all the islamic groups in egypt starting with the muslim brotherhood .
an egyptian expert says he has been converted by mr bin laden from being a nationalist islamist concerned with bringing islamic government to his country to an internationalist dedicated to attacking us interests anywhere in the world .
like mr bin laden , mr el zawahri now believes that his mission is to undermine the us , because it is behind the weakening of islamic governments and peoples .
if mr bin laden is eventually proved to have been behind the attacks on new york and washington , there is a likelihood , that mr zawahri 's followers could also be involved .
jihad implicated jihad was implicated in the 1998 bombing attacks against the american embassies in kenya and tanzania .
indeed shortly before that attack , jihad joined an organisation set up by mr bin laden , calling itself the international islamic front for combating crusaders and jews , which declared a holy war against the united states .
mr zawahri is said to be at odds with jihad 's imprisoned leaders in egypt , and the faction he leads appears to be mainly based abroad .
jihad itself has not carried out any attacks inside egypt since 1993 .
both jihad and the gamaa islamiya have been considerably weakened by repeated blows from the egyptian security services .
several of their leaders are serving long sentences in jail , while others are in exile .
in 1997 , gamaa leaders announced from jail that the group would abandon armed attacks .
the group had been responsible for shooting tourists , security officials and coptic christians .
the last operation attributed to the gamaa was the 1997 luxor massacre , in which 58 tourists were killed .
leaders of the group currently in afghanistan include refa 'i ahmed taha and muhammed al islambouli , the brother of the man who assassinated former president anwar el sadat .
autonomous group experts , however , say that they are not under mr bin laden 's control .
they are in afghanistan because it is the only place where they can live given that all have death sentences hanging over their heads in egypt .
there seems to have been an attempt to involve gamaa leaders in afghanistan in mr bin laden 's front for combating crusaders and jews , but it appears that the leadership in egypt objected and the group quickly distanced itself .
there have been no arrests in the ranks of the gamaa in connection with attacks on any american targets .

in the middle east , the normal rule is that the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
but in this case , that clearly does not apply for the iranians , whose relations with washington have been ruptured since shortly after the islamic revolution in 1979 , it is a situation which is clearly pregnant with both dangers and opportunities .
some quarters in washington have suggested drawing iran into the anti-terrorist coalition , while others have suggested it should be a target for reprisals .
iran finds itself caught in an uneasy position .
it has no relations with washington and it is on the us state department 's list of countries which back terrorism .
it openly sympathises with , and supports , groups such as the lebanese hezbollah , and the palestinian hamas and islamic jihad , which washington has labelled " terrorist " .
only three months ago , the us attorney general accused unnamed senior iranian officials of involvement in the truck bomb attack on an american military dormitory in saudi arabia in 1996 , in which 19 us servicemen were killed .
hostile to taleban at the same time , iran 's relations are hardly any better with its neighbour afghanistan , whose taleban rulers and their guest osama bin laden are top of the list of potential targets for american reprisals .
three years ago , iran nearly went to war with afghanistan , after 10 iranian diplomats were killed when the taleban overran mazar-i-sherif .
the taleban are sunni muslims , the iranian islamic regime is shia .
iran backs the afghan opposition alliance which stands against the taleban .
in the middle east , the normal rule is that the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
but in this case , that clearly does not apply .
so far , iran 's hostility to the taleban certainly has not inspired it to make common cause with the americans .
in fact , historically , tehran believes the americans helped create the taleban in the first place .
equally , shared hostility to washington has not pushed the iranians and the taleban to overcome their bitter differences .
the question is , whether this time , iran can stand on the touchlines and retain a kind of hostile neutrality , as it did when the us-led coalition struck another major neighbour , iraq , 10 years ago .
an opportunity ?
so far , the americans have made it clear there can be no middle ground : you are either with the new crusade against terrorism , or against it .
if it comes to a major operation against afghanistan , iran 's cooperation could be very useful , and tehran could come under strong pressure to help in one way or another .
there is clearly an opportunity for iran to take a big step forward in its relations with washington - and possibly , big penalties if it does not .
but it is not a simple step for tehran to take , given mutual historical grievances , and the divided nature of the iranian regime .
so far , western diplomats are impressed by the iranian response to the terrorist attacks on the us : they have been condemned by both sides of the system .
but going from there to active cooperation with an american-led coalition is obviously something else .
whatever president khatami and the reformists might want , such a move would need the full support of the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei .
he has so far remained silent on the affair .
his speeches are normally full of hostility to the us .
he regards it as iran 's biggest enemy , bent on world domination and undermining the islamic system by sponsoring a corrosive cultural invasion .
so it is hard to imagine that iran could simply forget the past and hop on the american bandwagon without conditions .
inducements but western diplomats here do not rule out a positive shift in relations between the two countries - if the americans and their allies can come up with some kind of reciprocal inducements .
one element , for example , could be to include the violent iranian opposition faction , the mujahideen khalq organisation , as a target in the drive against terrorism .
for iran , there may also be risks involved in simply trying to sit it out .
a lot depends on how far the americans decide to go .
if , for example , they resolved to take out the taleban altogether , iran might risk watching the establishment of what could be another hostile regime on its borders .
if it were involved , it could help influence and be part of the outcome .
despite many attempts at a thaw , iran 's relations with the us have remained stubbornly frozen for years .
the fallout from the extraordinary events of the past week , might just generate enough heat to begin the melting process .

i want to follow the path of my father and to pursue the independence of my country ahmed shah masood 's son weeping mourners carried pictures of the veteran commander , as he was buried near his home village in the heart of the panjshir valley in northern afghanistan .
the bbc central asia correspondent says there was a clear sense of personal grief among those present , to whom mr masood was much more than a military leader .
the commander died after a suicide bomb attack a week ago by two men disguised as arab journalists .
taleban blamed the leader of the ousted afghan government , president burhanuddin rabbani , said that mr masood would not be forgotten .
the taleban are under the control of osama bin laden and pakistan .
such people will be eradicated at once if god is willing ousted president rabbani he said the taleban and their supporters in pakistan were responsible for the commander 's death .
" the taleban are under the control of osama bin laden and pakistan .
such people will be eradicated at once if god is willing , " he said .
mr masood 's son , also called ahmed , addressed the mourners .
" i want to follow the path of my father and to pursue the independence of my country , " he told them .
mr masood 's body was brought by helicopter to the scene and loaded onto a gun carriage .
as the mourners moved towards the venue for the funeral service , a voice called out through a loudspeaker : " death to pakistan .
death to the taleban .
death to osama .
we will fight for our freedom to the very end . "
ahmed shah masood 's death was announced on saturday following days of conflicting reports .
the 49-year-old commander had been giving an interview to two arabs posing as journalists when a bomb went off .
it had been concealed in a video camera .
' lion of panjshir ' he was not in fact the official leader of the opposition to the taleban , but he was widely seen as the real obstacle to their conquest of the remaining enclaves of afghanistan .
masood 's forces hold part of northern afghanistan his troops hold the strategic panjshir valley north of kabul and mountainous country even further north .
masood gained the name " lion of panjshir " for his resistance to the soviet invasion of afghanistan from 1979 , and went on to become defence minister after kabul was recaptured in 1992 .

i want to follow the path of my father and to pursue the independence of my country ahmed shah masood 's son weeping mourners carried pictures of the veteran commander , as he was buried near his home village in the heart of the panjshir valley in northern afghanistan .
the bbc central asia correspondent says there was a clear sense of personal grief among those present , to whom mr masood was much more than a military leader .
the commander died after a suicide bomb attack a week ago by two men disguised as arab journalists .
taleban blamed the leader of the ousted afghan government , president burhanuddin rabbani , said that mr masood would not be forgotten .
the taleban are under the control of osama bin laden and pakistan .
such people will be eradicated at once if god is willing ousted president rabbani he said the taleban and their supporters in pakistan were responsible for the commander 's death .
" the taleban are under the control of osama bin laden and pakistan .
such people will be eradicated at once if god is willing , " he said .
mr masood 's son , also called ahmed , addressed the mourners .
" i want to follow the path of my father and to pursue the independence of my country , " he told them .
mr masood 's body was brought by helicopter to the scene and loaded onto a gun carriage .
as the mourners moved towards the venue for the funeral service , a voice called out through a loudspeaker : " death to pakistan .
death to the taleban .
death to osama .
we will fight for our freedom to the very end . "
ahmed shah masood 's death was announced on saturday following days of conflicting reports .
the 49-year-old commander had been giving an interview to two arabs posing as journalists when a bomb went off .
it had been concealed in a video camera .
' lion of panjshir ' he was not in fact the official leader of the opposition to the taleban , but he was widely seen as the real obstacle to their conquest of the remaining enclaves of afghanistan .
his troops hold the strategic panjshir valley north of kabul and mountainous country even further north .
masood gained the name " lion of panjshir " for his resistance to the soviet invasion of afghanistan from 1979 , and went on to become defence minister after kabul was recaptured in 1992 .
but warring factions within the government brought new conflict to kabul .
then a new force backed by pakistan , the taleban , swept through the country and took the capital for themselves in 1996 .

catrin was captured with her children , two girls and one boy , at harlech in 1409 during owain 's fight for the freedom of wales .
the ceremony has taken place on glyndwr 's day which many believe should be proclaimed a bank holiday .
catrin was buried with her children in st swithin 's church in the city of london following their death in 1413 .
the sculpture which has been crafted out of gelligaer bluestone has been erected in cannon street gardens .
the design for the statue was created by pontypridd-based nic stradlyn-john , and sculpted by cwmdu-based richard renshaw .
it has a curving naturalistic form and a flowing line leading from the stone base to a bronze tip suggests two figures : a mother protecting her child .
it is meant to represent the suffering of women and children in war and to celebrate the enduring spirit of wales .
unveiled the monument ms phillips said : " it is a great honour to be asked to unveil this statue for catrin glyndwr .
" the memorial will create a focal point in london for people with welsh connections and i 'm sure that it will become a natural venue for future events and celebrations . "
glyndwr , who was proclaimed prince of wales on 16 september , 1400 after rebelling against english rule , is a key figure in welsh history and was the last welsh-born prince of wales .
calls were made last autumn on the 600th anniversary of owain glyndwr for a glyndwr day bank holiday .
campaign group embassy believes the anniversary of the revolt in wales against henry iv should become a national day .

he 's on the fbi 's most wanted list with a $ 5m price on his head .
jane corbin reports on the saudi-born dissident turned terror mastermind .
eight years ago , the world trade center became a focus for osama bin laden 's hatred against america .
his henchmen bombed it in 1993 but failed to bring it down .
now it seems he has succeeded .
a shocked us administration has confirmed that he is the prime suspect behind the wave of hijackings and the destruction of the heart of new york and the pentagon .
the big question is why ?
why does a man who is personally mild , polite , as well as being hospitable to strangers in the tradition of the muslim world , hate america so much ?
the answer lies in his own history and that of his country .
mr bin laden was born the seventeenth son of a wealthy saudi family .
but he rejected his heritage to become a mujahideen freedom fighter in afghanistan against the soviet union .
in 1991 , mr bin laden was enraged by what he saw as the occupation of his country by american forces during the gulf war .
he accused them of propping up the corrupt rulers of the desert kingdom and bringing infidel ways to saudi arabia , where some of the most sacred sites in the muslim world are situated .
this , with arab anger at america 's support for israel against the palestinian people and the suffering of the iraqi people under united nations sanctions , was the holy cause he built his movement on .
mr bin laden began to establish a revolutionary organisation called al qaeeda or " the base " .
he established camps in afghanistan , training volunteers from many countries to use explosives and weapons - and to establish secret cell like structures , almost impossible for spy agencies to penetrate .
today , mr bin laden lives in the mountain stronghold of afghanistan .
he is constantly moving - his own people never know where he will spend the night .
he is said not to use a telephone or have any electrical equipment near him , for fear of a hidden bomb or electronic signals giving away his whereabouts .
he has told his followers he is living on borrowed time and there have been at least five attempts on his life .
the americans plotted to send in a commando squad to snatch him , but aborted the plan at the last minute for fear of suffering too many casualties .
they regretted that decision when in 1998 , a massive truck bomb destroyed the us embassy in nairobi , killing more than 212 people .
it was followed within minutes by the destruction of the us embassy in neighbouring tanzania .
it sent a chilling message .
mr bin laden could organise massive simultaneous attacks using his underground network .
panorama travelled to east africa , from the slums of nairobi to a sleepy village on the beach of mombassa , to piece together how the cell-based terror network works .
one of the main conspirators was a jordanian man who spent years blending into the community as a fisherman before receiving the call to activate the bomb .
in a seedy hotel room in nairobi , he met others who had flown in to build the bomb and plan its detonation .
in the wake of the nairobi bombing , the americans pounded mr bin laden 's afghan training camps with cruise missiles , but this may only have made him more of a hero in the islamic world .
he never claimed responsibility for the bombing , he never does .
but young men flocked to him inspired by what they called his " devotion " , even though many millions of muslims reject his violent ways .
' double standard ' mr bin laden has made his own videos and they have been widely spread amongst the muslim community , including in britain .
they show him brandishing a kalashnikov at target practice and contain footage of the suicide bombing of the warship uss cole in aden , which killed 17 sailors last october .
the bombing is intercut with images of the suffering of the palestinian people , coffins in rows and bloodied corpses .
it emphasises mr bin laden 's belief that the west has a double standard when it comes to the death of arabs .
now the world holds it breath as america decides what to do .
but stopping the movement that mr bin laden has created will be extremely difficult , even if he himself is killed .
some believe that even in death he may still inspire others to take up arms under his rallying call of " death to america " .
