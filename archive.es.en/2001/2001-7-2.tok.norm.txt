a survey by the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- , the city watchdog , reveals a high degree of inaction among endowment holders - even though many face shortfalls worth thousands of pounds . "
making sure you can repay your mortgage loan is one of the most basic financial needs " christine farnish of the fsa in the past year , almost all households with an endowment mortgage have received letters telling them whether their policy is on track to pay off their mortgage .
but figures from the fsa reveal that seven out of ten households have failed to respond .
endowment-linked mortgages were the most popular type of home loan during the 1980s and early 1990s , but growth projections were based on healthy market conditions at the time .
since then , poor stock market returns combined with low inflation now means that these original projections are no longer valid - and millions now face a shortfall on their loan .
plummeting returns half of the endowment holders who have not taken action said the reason was that they now had other means to pay off their mortgage .
the other policy holders - equivalent to 3.65m households - have failed to take any remedial action .
" making sure you can repay your mortgage loan is one of the most basic financial needs , " said christine farnish , director of consumer relations at the fsa .
" if there is a risk that you wo n't be able to , and you 're not comfortable with that , then now 's the time to decide on what to do .
if you need to put more money aside to pay off your mortgage , it 's a lot less painful to do it sooner rather than later , " she added .
experts fear that if they do not act now , they will not be able to pay off their loan at the end of the mortgage term , and could lose their homes as a consequence .
about 10.5m endowment holders should now have received a colour-coded letter which outlines how much their investment needs to grow to stay on track .
as many as 14.6 % letters , just over 1.5m homeowners , have been sent ' red letters ' warning homeowners that their policy needs to grow by more than 8 % to meet its target .
three in ten owners who have received ' amber letters ' have been told to keep a close eye on their policy , whereas the 53.9 % of mortgage holders who have received ' green letters ' are likely to remain on track as long as the stock market grows by 6 % .
way out ?
but critics argue that the letters - sent by endowment providers - may only confuse policy holders further .
they also accuse the government of betraying endowment holders , after it ruled out a comprehensive investigation into the sale of endowment mortgages last year .
it is now up to individual policy holders to pursue their own compensation claims .
so far , only £ 35m has been paid and to about 11,000 complainants .
the fsa is encouraging people to make claims to the financial ombudsman service if they feel that they were not informed of the risks associated with the policies .
despite revised projections , mortgage experts warned people last week not to surrender their policies .
but they should also not top-up their plans according to their insurance company 's projections .
pat bunton of london & country , a mortgage broker , said : " do not throw good money after bad .
the best solution is to reduce your reliance on the endowment , and repay the loan by other means . "
bunton suggests moving any projected shortfall into a repayment loan .
this will ensure that both the underlying debt is paid off each month .

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- festival calls time on drink ban low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo monday , 2 july , 2001 , 05:58 gmt 06:58 uk festival calls time on drink ban the festival is celebrating its 55th anniversary this year alcohol goes on sale at the llangollen international eisteddfod for the first time on monday - breaking with a 55-year tradition that the festival should be a dry event .
visitors will be able to toast the winners with an alcoholic drink now that organisers have decided to open a bar on the eisteddfod field .
eisteddfod chairman gh northing at the opening ceremony the somewhat radical move might not have been approved of by the event 's founder , the late caesar hughes , who was a puritanical teetotaller .
he was a shrewd businessman who did not approve of alcohol and insisted it should be banned from the festival .
the multi-cultural festival was set up as a means of promoting international harmony in the wake of world war ii .
it was back in 1946 when he was approached by a group of people from llangollen who had the idea of setting up the annual eisteddfod .
he threw his energies behind the project and , more than half a century later , the event has grown and grown .
smuggling it regularly attracts more than 6,500 competitors representing some 47 countries - and an audience of nearly 100,000 .
hundreds of thousands more also enjoy the festival through the television coverage .
like that other great welsh cultural event , the national eisteddfod , llangollen has always been a teetotal event - even though visitors have been smuggling in their own alcohol for many years .
but when the festival opens on monday , organisers will be able to celebrate the 55th anniversary with a drink at a bar on site - set up in response to public demand .
iechyd da ! : winners can be toasted in style the bar will be run by an old family friend of caesar hughes , colin louchlim of white house wines , and serving behind it will be caesar 's grandson .
this year 's event - held in the small market town on the banks of the river dee - has been overshadowed by administrative hitches .
last month , organisers said they were concerned for the future after a number of international groups had to withdraw because of visa problems .
officials were worried that the festival would struggle to keep its unique international flavour if the situation did not improve .
visa problems the main problem was the expense of visas in countries like the ukraine , where they cost £ 33 a head - more than a week 's salary .
a group from algeria had other visa problems .
they would have had to travel 1,000 miles to tunisia - because visas are not issued in their own country .
a further setback was that there were no concessions for children applying for a visa .
organisers said that , as a result , the festival had seen a reduction in the number of children 's groups planning to attend .
staying home last summer there were concerns that potential asylum seekers from eastern europe had attempted to use the eisteddfod as a way of getting into the uk .
members of dance groups from armenia and romania were refused entry after questions were raised about their visa applications .
two folkdance groups which should have performed were forced to stay at home .
british embassy officials in armenia became suspicious when several young single men - who had joined a folkdance group the previous november - applied for visas to compete at the eisteddfod .
when their requests to enter the uk were rejected the entire group pulled out of the trip .
members of a romanian group were also refused visas after questions were raised about some of their members ' reasons for wanting to come to wales .

it was back in 1946 when he was approached by a group of people from llangollen who had the idea of setting up the annual eisteddfod .
he threw his energies behind the project and , more than half a century later , the event has grown and grown .
smuggling it regularly attracts more than 6,500 competitors representing some 47 countries - and an audience of nearly 100,000 .
hundreds of thousands more also enjoy the festival through the television coverage .
like that other great welsh cultural event , the national eisteddfod , llangollen has always been a teetotal event - even though visitors have been smuggling in their own alcohol for many years .
but when the festival opens on monday , organisers will be able to celebrate the 55th anniversary with a drink at a bar on site - set up in response to public demand .
the bar will be run by an old family friend of caesar hughes , colin louchlim of white house wines , and serving behind it will be caesar 's grandson .
this year 's event - held in the small market town on the banks of the river dee - has been overshadowed by administrative hitches .
last month , organisers said they were concerned for the future after a number of international groups had to withdraw because of visa problems .
officials were worried that the festival would struggle to keep its unique international flavour if the situation did not improve .
visa problems the main problem was the expense of visas in countries like the ukraine , where they cost £ 33 a head - more than a week 's salary .
a group from algeria had other visa problems .
they would have had to travel 1,000 miles to tunisia - because visas are not issued in their own country .
a further setback was that there were no concessions for children applying for a visa .
organisers said that , as a result , the festival had seen a reduction in the number of children 's groups planning to attend .
staying home last summer there were concerns that potential asylum seekers from eastern europe had attempted to use the eisteddfod as a way of getting into the uk .
members of dance groups from armenia and romania were refused entry after questions were raised about their visa applications .
two folkdance groups which should have performed were forced to stay at home .
british embassy officials in armenia became suspicious when several young single men - who had joined a folkdance group the previous november - applied for visas to compete at the eisteddfod .
when their requests to enter the uk were rejected the entire group pulled out of the trip .
members of a romanian group were also refused visas after questions were raised about some of their members ' reasons for wanting to come to wales .
