the centre for economics and business research -lrb- cebr -rrb- said the figure covers loss of earnings , higher food prices and the impact of the crisis on the tourism industry .
meanwhile farmers in cumbria are getting ready to voice their concerns over the mass slaughter of healthy animals .
junior agriculture minister joyce quinn is visiting the region to try to explain the policy , which many farmers , and the rspca , say is unnecessary .
we do n't know they are healthy and we do n't have time to go around and mess about blood testing robin spence nfu the cull of healthy animals , planned as a pre-emptive strike to halt the spread of foot-and-mouth disease , began on saturday on two farms in aberdeenshire and moray in the north east of scotland .
the sheep destroyed were on farms in the highlands where there have not been any confirmed cases of the disease .
however , they all have associations with the infected market at longtown near carlisle .
palace concerns the queen is reported to believe horse racing bosses are behaving insensitively by not banning the sport for the duration of the crisis .
buckingham palace says she has been in correspondence with the british racing board of control but has refused to confirm the reports .
some farmers have condemned the cull of healthy animals , but others believe the government 's action is justified .
robin spence , from the national farmers union in dumfries , said : " we do n't know they are healthy and we do n't have time to go around and mess about blood testing because the disease could be spreading into other areas . " 25 new cases " we must take the bigger picture .
if we do n't stop it here it 's all over the country . "
twenty-five new cases of foot-and-mouth were confirmed on saturday , with a further case in anglesey confirmed on sunday , bringing the total across the uk to 299 .
maff said the latest outbreaks include the first confirmed case in the county of shropshire , at a sheep farm near newport .
one of britain 's biggest landowners , the duke of westminster , explained why he gave half a million pounds to help farmers affected by foot-and-mouth disease .
the duke said he had discussed his donation with the prince of wales - who has given a similar amount , and told how he had been affected by the suffering of farmers in the 1967 outbreak .
cull ' justified ' chief veterinary officer jim scudamore has agreed to meet farmers on monday in cumbria and dumfries and galloway where the cull will be most widespread .
on sunday , he justified the ongoing cull of healthy animals .
" if we do n't remove the potential source of infection it will remain there and it will cause considerable problems when the sheep are put on the hills , " he told the bbc 's breakfast with frost programme .
" later on it will act as a focus of disease and infection and it will keep spilling over into the rest of cumbria and it could spill back into the rest of the country . "
the potential loss from foreign tourism is massive paul crawford cebr the cebr has warned that the effects of foot-and-mouth on the economy will continue into next year , with another £ 2.1bn loss predicted .
paul crawford , cebr senior economist , believed one of the most alarming findings was the lower income from fewer foreign visitors .
" while a lot of domestic tourism expenditure will be reallocated into other activities , the potential loss from foreign tourism is massive , " he said .
events cancelled the ongoing crisis has had an impact on other events planned for the weekend .
the countryside alliance cancelled a " liberty and livelihood " march due to be held in london on sunday because of the crisis .
the alliance 's chief executive richard burge will deliver a " calling card " to the houses of parliament .
and leaders of plaid cymru have called for members living in areas affected by the outbreak not to attend the party 's spring conference .
a special church service for londoners worried about the crisis was also being held at st martins-in-the-fields on sunday .
