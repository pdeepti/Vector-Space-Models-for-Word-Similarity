the crisis comes hours after mr qarase - a nationalist hardliner - was sworn in .
i do n't have to talk to mr chaudhry about who is in my cabinet laisenia qarase on monday , mr chaudhry - who was the fiji 's first ethnic indian prime minister - demanded representation in the cabinet as guaranteed by the constitution .
mr chaudhry , who says his labour party would work as an opposition within government , has insisted the move would not destabilise the country .
however , mr qarase , who has described such a situation as unworkable , told reporters : " i do n't have to talk to mr chaudhry about who is in my cabinet . "
mr qarase was appointed prime minister following fiji 's first elections since mr chaudhry was ousted in a coup led by failed businessman turned nationalist figurehead , george speight , 15 months ago .
but although his fijian people 's party -lrb- sdl -rrb- won the most seats , the prime minister says it now faces having a minority voice in his own cabinet .
fiji 's constitution states any party with more than 10 % of the seats in the new parliament must be offered a cabinet position - mr chaudhry 's labour party is entitled to 46 % of ministerial positions .
' it will never work ' on monday , mr qarase duly invited his rival to join the government but at the same time appealed to mr chaudhry not to accept any posts .
election results total : 71 seats qarase 's sdl : 31 chaudhry 's flp : 27 mv : six new labour unity party : two independents : two united general party and the national federation party : one each one seat vacant he said : " it means he -lsb- mr chaudhry -rsb- will have to get about eight seats .
i get 12 and i have an obligation to give some to the smaller parties .
say i give five , i end up with seven .
" the numbers do n't stack up and it will never work . "
mr chaudhry says he will take up mr qarase 's offer but as an opposition group within the government .
commenting on his decision to join the cabinet , mr chaudhry said : " if you could be in government , what fool in politics would want to be in the opposition ? "
the bbc 's phil mercer in the fijian capital , suva , says such an arrangement would mean the new administration would be divided like no other in fiji 's political history .
mr chaudhry 's party won 27 out of 71 parliamentary seats , while mr qarase 's nationalist fijian people 's party -lrb- sdl -rrb- won 31 , failing to secure an outright majority .
mr chaudhry says he will challenge the election results in court , accusing indigenous fijians of ballot-rigging .
seeking coalition it is still unclear who mr qarase 's other coalition partners will be .
the balance of power in parliament is held by a small group of moderates and ultra-nationalists .
mr qarase faces a tough challenge - fiji 's economy is in depression and the racial divide that led to the coup is as deep as ever .
in may 2000 , gunmen led by george speight deposed mr chaudhry and laid siege to the nation 's parliament , demanding a decisive governmental role for ethnic fijians .
mr speight is now in prison awaiting trial for treason .
his conservative alliance matanitu vanua -lrb- mv -rrb- nationalist group won six seats in the election .

the firefighters called off the strike as lawyers were due to meet with a high court judge to apply for an injunction forcing the fire brigade union to refuse to accept the stoppage .
the industrial action affected all 26 fire stations and left merseyside without emergency cover for five hours .
firefighters walked out over the suspension of a colleague who is alleged to have published a website containing " racist and sexist " material during a previous dispute .
we have now reached an agreement which means the member is on special leave neil thompson , fire brigade union the strike was called off at 1800 bst on 10 september .
peter dowd , chairman of the merseyside fire authority , said : " we had to protect the people of merseyside and our own legal position to take every action necessary to provide emergency cover .
" i do n't think there has ever been a situation in britain where firefighters have gone on strike and left no emergency cover . "
fire brigade union -lrb- fbu -rrb- officials say they returned to work after securing an agreement with management over the firefighter who was suspended .
he was being disciplined following allegations about the content of the website , which has since been closed down .
fbu officials are due to meet management from the fire authority to discuss the issue later this week .
neil thompson , regional chairman of the fbu , said : " we were told the member was being suspended .
" we believed the action broke the back-to-work agreement we made at the end of the strike and that led to members at all the fire stations going on strike .
" we have now reached an agreement which means the member is on special leave . "
' risked safety ' national officers from the fbu are due to meet management from the merseyside fire brigade to discuss the issue next week .
chief fire officer malcolm saunders described the strike as dangerous and unlawful .
he said : " i 'm very disturbed indeed .
this was unlawful action which placed the lives and safety of the people of merseyside at risk and there was no justification for it at all .
" we suspended a fire officer because of allegations that he is involved in the publication of a website containing obscene , sexist and racist material .
" he was suspended on full pay and there is no presumption of guilt in that suspension .
" it is quite normal procedure and he is not being proceeded against in any way because of taking strike action . "
between 1300 and 1800 bst , when the strike officially ended , the fire service control room was run by a skeleton staff of senior managers and a few operators .
fires were reported to the police to tackle but there were no major incidents .
union hostility fbu leaders said there were no plans to repeat the action .
in july , army green goddesses were deployed after merseyside fire service held two eight-day strikes .
the action was sparked by plans to promote civilian staff to management positions , but it took place in the context of long-standing hostility between union members and mr saunders .
the website which is believed to have caused today 's suspension includes poems which mock mr saunders .

the hopes were raised after several banks agreed to extend their credit lines to the beleaguered firm .
ahead of monday 's 4p rise in its share price , market speculators had forced the price down to 29.5p , betting on its collapse .
several analysts recommended investors to buy at this price on monday , though some remain sceptical .
marconi 's share price has stooped from £ 12.50 a year ago , valuing the company at £ 35bn , to 33.5p on monday in one of the most spectacular corporate failures in uk history .
ftse relegation debts of almost £ 4.5bn continue to burden the company and some analysts have doubts about its ability to repay them .
the ftse 100 company , which carried out a disastrous switch to telecoms from defence , is expected to be relegated on tuesday from the index of leading uk shares .

the hopes were raised after several banks agreed to extend their credit lines to the beleaguered firm .
ahead of monday 's 4p rise in its share price , market speculators had forced the price down to 29.5p , betting on its collapse .
several analysts recommended investors to buy at this price on monday , though some remain sceptical .
marconi 's share price has stooped from £ 12.50 a year ago , valuing the company at £ 35bn , to 33.5p on monday in one of the most spectacular corporate failures in uk history .
ftse relegation debts of almost £ 4.5bn continue to burden the company and some analysts have doubts about its ability to repay them .
the ftse 100 company , which carried out a disastrous switch to telecoms from defence , is expected to be relegated on tuesday from the index of leading uk shares .

speaking in new york on monday , the man who chaired negotiations which brought about the 1998 peace accord said he was confident the northern ireland peace process could survive .
in a message to paramilitary organisations in the province , mr mitchell said : " the negotiations were based upon a report which i and two other international representatives authored .
" it required all of the political parties to commit themselves to it .
those principles stated clearly and explicitly total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations . "
he also said that political leadership was vital for the process to succeed .
i think most people in both communities want their difficulties sorted out by peaceful democratic processes , not by bombs and bullets george mitchell the former us senator said he believed that people in the province did not wish to return to conflict but that the current dispute in north belfast showed there remained an element of sectarian hatred in society here .
" i think most people in both communities want their difficulties sorted out by peaceful democratic processes , not by bombs and bullets , " he said .
he added that all sides in the process must concentrate on the three " outstanding issues " of decommissioning , policing and demilitarisation .
speaking at a lecture in st bartholomew 's episcopal church in manhattan , mr mitchell said bitter sectarian rhetoric continued in northern ireland , three and a half years after the agreement was ratified .
' complete package ' " today there remain very difficult issues of implementation , as anyone who has seen a newspaper or seen the television news in the last week can attest .
" despite the continuing difficulty of implementation , i believe that the path to peace has been irreversibly set . "
mr mitchell emphasised that the agreement was a complete package and could not be " implemented selectively " .
george mitchell : " agreement is not selective " " the good friday agreement contains a lot of recommendations and is a single entity , " he said .
" integral to the premise of the agreement was that it has to be implemented in full .
it was not a selective agreement .
" there are three major issues - decommissioning of weapons , policing and demilitarisation .
there has to be progress on all of them .
" people do not want to go back but they do not want to give in .
the challenge for all political leaders is to reconcile these conflicting demands . "
mr mitchell was speaking ahead of the visit of richard haass , the new american administration 's special envoy to northern ireland , to the province for talks with the political parties on the peace process .
northern ireland 's devolved institutions will collapse on september 22 if no first minister or deputy first minister are elected .

mr vajpayee was speaking after a meeting in delhi with a delegation of political leaders from tamil nadu .
the state has been warning that crops in the cauvery delta will perish if karnataka does not release the water soon .
but last week karnataka officials told a central river water monitoring committee that there was to little water in the reservoirs to even consider releasing any at the moment .
mr vajpayee said he would speak to the karnataka chief minister to try to resolve the deadlock .

so long as these injustices against the indigenous people of this country are not rectified , our peaceful demonstrations in the farmlands will continue zimbabwe war veterans representatives of zimbabwe 's war veterans told the regional leaders on monday that they did not feel bound by a commonwealth brokered agreement reached in nigeria last week .
under that deal , the zimbabwean government agreed to stop attacks by the veterans on white-owned farms in return for financial assistance from the uk to implement a fair land reform programme .
but the veterans said they would not abide by a programme whose " pace is controlled by the pace at which funds will trickle in from the british " .
regional anger reports from harare say that malawi 's president bakili maluzi was visibly angered by the defiance of the veterans .
mr maluzi is chairing the meeting which brings together leaders and representatives of the southern african development council -lrb- sadc -rrb- .
but the veterans were forthright in their demands : " so long as these injustices against the indigenous people of this country are not rectified , our peaceful demonstrations in the farmlands will continue , " the veterans told the sadc leaders .
the land issue also concerns south africa and namibia since the zimbabwe agreement , there have been reports of more violence on white-owned farms in northern zimbabwe , with the commercial farmers union speaking of a big increase in land invasions .
analysts say president robert mugabe will have to decide whether to try to restrain the war veterans , given that his regional neighbours are now placing much heavier pressure on him to restore stability to the country .
malawi 's president maluzi said that if zimbabwe 's land crisis was not resolved urgently in an amicable and peaceful manner , then the political and economic problems could easily snowball across the entire region .
that , he said , would lead to foreign investors turning their backs on sadc states .
africa intervenes the bbc 's southern africa correspondent , rageh omaar , says it is now clear that major african nations are not only urging the zimbabwean government to do everything to end the crisis , but are also prepared to break ranks openly with harare .
he says zimbabwe can not afford to be totally isolated and publicly at odds with african powers like south africa and nigeria , as well as other neighbours .
hundreds of farms have been seized by self-styled war veterans since february 2000 in protest at the fact that - 20 years after independence - the vast majority of the most productive land in the country is still owned by a small number of whites .
mr mugabe has accepted the land ownership plan in principle , but says the deal will have to be approved by the cabinet and his ruling zanu-pf party .
in a new blow to president mugabe , the main opposition party , the movement for democratic change , was on monday declared winner of the mayoral election in zimbabwe 's second city , bulawayo .
however the ruling zanu-pf party retained the parliamentary seat of makoni west in a by-election following the death of defence minister moven mohachi .

the mirror claims that the device which blew up pan am flight 103 over the small scottish town may not have been loaded at frankfurt , an assertion made by the prosecution team .
its theory stems from an interview with heathrow airport security guard ray manly who said he told police that pan am 's baggage area was broken into on 21 december , 1988 , some 17 hours before the plane set off for new york .
mr manly was interviewed by anti-terrorist officers a month after the tragedy , but his evidence was " lost " and never used in court .
during the trial in the netherlands it was claimed by the prosecution that accused libyan abdelbaset al megrahi placed the bomb on a flight from malta to frankfurt , where it was then " interlined " on to a flight to heathrow before being loaded on to flight 103 .
in february this year , al megrahi was convicted of mass murder and jailed for a minimum of 20 years .
fellow accused , libyan al amin khalifa fhimah , was acquitted of the crime .
al megrahi 's defence team said during the trial at camp zeist that it was more likely the bomb was introduced at heathrow .
bolt cutters mr manly told police he found that a padlock near the pan am desk at heathrow 's terminal three appeared to have been severed with bolt cutters .
this would have cleared the way for a bomb to be planted among pan am luggage which had already passed through security checks , the newspaper said .
mr manly told the mirror : " i ca n't believe the statement was lost .
" no one at the trial knew about the break-in . "
dr jim swire , whose 23-year-old daughter flora died in the crash , said the new claims added to his continued calls for a full public inquiry .
he said : " these kind of aspects not only show failures at heathrow , they bring questions that serious mistakes have been made during the -lrb- police -rrb- inquiry .
" as soon as the appeal process is over we want a full inquiry into why heathrow did n't take full steps to protect our loved ones . "
dr swire said the fact the plane had been loaded from empty at the london airport also showed the need for the uk government to set up an inquiry to determine exactly what happened .
" what we are after is the whole truth , " added dr swire .
the high court of judiciary in edinburgh last month granted al megrahi , 49 , permission to appeal against his conviction .
a preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place in camp zeist next month .

jens stoltenberg contemplates defeat norway 's labour party has suffered its worst election result since 1924 , after an election campaign dominated by anger at high taxes .
with 98 % of the votes counted by early tuesday , labour had taken only around 24 % - down from 35 % at the last general election four years ago .
what is clear is that this was a very bad election outgoing prime minister jens stoltenberg weeks of horse-trading are now thought likely to lie ahead , as three parties try to form a government - and three men attempt to become prime minister .
voters were thought to be protesting at tax rates of up to 50 % and inadequate public services , in a country made wealthy by oil .
election officials said labour was likely to take around 43 seats in the 165-member parliament - down dramatically from its previous level of 65 .
the conservatives came second with about 21 % - giving them a likely 38 seats .
projected seats labour - 43 conservatives 38 christian democrat-led coalition - 34 far-right party of progress - 26 socialist left - 23 the parties will need to build a coalition bloc adding up to 83 seats to secure a majority in the parliament , the storting .
among the smaller parties , the far-right party of progress has made gains .
it won an estimated 26 seats , up from 20 .
the three-party centrist christian democratic-led coalition won a projected 34 seats , down from 42 .
former prime minister kjell magne bondevik , of the christian people 's party , said he would also try to form a government .
the outgoing prime minister , jens stoltenberg , who ran the old minority labour administration , admitted it had been a " bad election " but said he would stay in office if he could muster enough parliamentary support .
" we wo n't cling to power at all costs , but it would nevertheless be a mistake to relinquish the responsibility of government , " he said .
the party 's leader , thorbjoern jagland , said the vote had been a " serious warning shot " .
the historically bad result for the labour party is a message that there must be a change of government conservative leader jan petersen " we will have to make a decision about whether to continue in government after we know the full results , " he said .
the conservatives hailed the result , and said they should now lead a coalition to power .
" the historically bad result for the labour party is a message that there must be a change of government , " conservative leader jan petersen said .
the campaign in one of the world 's richest nations had focused on taxation and the state of public services .
many voters do n't understand how it is possible that we have so much money and yet pay high taxes and live with so many problems that do n't seem to get fixed think-tank researcher jo saglie opposition parties argued the government should use norway 's vast oil wealth to cut taxes and improve health and education .
their claims appear to have struck a chord with voters , fed up with paying high tax and seeing vital services decline - while watching the government apparently hoarding oil revenue .
" many voters do n't understand how it is possible that we have so much money and yet pay high taxes and live with so many problems that do n't seem to get fixed , " said jo saglie , a senior fellow at the institute for social research , an oslo-based think tank .
" the arguments against spending more of the oil money are very complex and people just do n't understand them . "
final official results will not be declared until wednesday .
around three-quarters of norway 's 3.3m voters took part in the poll .

the scottish football association and the british government have expressed concerns over safety .
two bombs have exploded in makhachkala in the last week .

the british foreign office is concerned by the security situation uefa has visited the region and expressed its satisfaction with the city , the stadium and the security arrangements , but the british foreign office is warning travellers of the dangers of visiting the region .

the scottish football association has been urging uefa to change the venue , possibly to moscow at a later date .

the glasgow club , rangers , is scheduled to travel to the troubled russian region which borders chechnya this week for a uefa cup tie .
the scottish football association and the british government have expressed concerns over safety .
two bombs have exploded in makhachkala in the last week .
insurance it is the first time that anzhi of dagestan has played in european club competition .
but the small first-division side , which finished fourth in the russian league , has given the football authorities a major problem .
uefa has visited the region and expressed its satisfaction with the city , the stadium and the security arrangements , but the british foreign office is warning travellers of the dangers of visiting the region .
because of the foreign office advice , rangers and potential football reporters have found it virtually impossible to arrange insurance for the match .
the value of the rangers team has been estimated at $ 70m .
last tuesday a bomb went off outside a railway station at makhachkala and another exploded at a market at the weekend .
precedent uefa has admited there is no set procedure for clubs travelling to areas which governments have classified as dangerous for travellers .
on friday , europe 's governing body said it was in touch with the two clubs concerned and had received further information that needed to be considered .
the scottish football association has been urging uefa to change the venue , possibly to moscow at a later date .
but uefa will be anxious not to set a precedent that can be used by other clubs to avoid playing in an area they would rather avoid .

the court decided the hospital that carried out the transfusion was liable because it had not screened its blood for hiv , the virus that can lead to aids .
china 's hiv timebomb 50,000 - chinese estimates 600,000 - who estimates 10 million - who projection for 2010 the case has potential repercussions for many thousands of other chinese aids sufferers who have become infected from contaminated blood or medical equipment .
the court in eastern china 's jiangsu province ordered the hospital that carried out the blood transfusion to pay the compensation to the husband and young daughter of the woman who died .
the woman had been given a transfusion at the hospital three years ago during a difficult childbirth .
she died late last year .
her husband and baby daughter have also tested positive for hiv .
this is thought to be the first time a chinese court has awarded such a large amount to a victim of hiv-tainted blood .
a flood of similar cases could now follow .
blood trade hiv contamination is believed to be widespread in china 's poorly funded and unhygienic blood collection system .
thousands have been infected with hiv through selling blood more than half a million people in the central chinese province of henan are thought to have become infected by selling their blood to commercial blood dealers during the 1990s .
victims have described how their blood was pooled into a single container while the plasma was drawn off and the remaining mixture of blood from several different people then pumped back into their veins .
this case may have struck a blow for the victims of such criminal negligence , but it 's still highly doubtful whether the victims will actually see the money .
rather than pay a lump sum , the court ordered the hospital to pay annual instalments of around $ 20,000 , but even that might be too much .
hospitals in china are chronically under-funded and in the past declared themselves bankrupt rather than pay compensation .

visitors to london are faced with an ever expanding number of options of things to see and do but nothing can be seen as more central to british life than the westminster parliament .
this summer , for the second year in a row , tourists are offered the opportunity to see the lords and the commons .
one thing any visiter discovers quite quickly is that much of the palace of westminster - so-called because it used to house monarchs up until the reign of king henry viii - is actually much newer than it appears .
fire of 1834 in 1834 a fire swept through the original palace after someone overfilled a furnace .
as a result , of the original medieval building only westminster hall survives .
the current building , with that exception , was designed by charles barry and built between 1840 and 1852 .
the result is an ostentatious monument to the victorian era .
robing room when the queen arrives for the state opening of parliament she comes in a carriage which is driven straight through the sovereign 's entrance where she is greeted and then ascends to her robing room .
but not having a horse drawn carriage to hand mere visitors have to walk through the entrance .
the robing room - where the queen puts on the state robes and imperial state crown ahead of delivering the queen 's speech - is used for little else .
the next stop on the tour is the royal gallery which has been used in the past for foreign heads of state to address both houses of parliament .
the room is notable for two large paintings depicting british victories over the french at trafalgar and waterloo .
this fact was nearly embarassingly overlooked when the french president charles de gaulle was due to give a speech .
lordly pomp while little on the tour thus far could be described as ' plainly decorated ' nothing in the earlier rooms will prepare people for the house of lords chamber .
the focal point of the chamber is the queen 's throne which she uses when delivering the queen 's speech .
the throne and its canopy were designed by augustus pugin and can only be described as an extravaganza of gold leaf .
in front of the throne is the woolsack which the lord chancellor sits on when he is chairing debates .
by tradition mps are not allowed to enter the lords although on the occasion of the queen 's speech , they are allowed to stand behind the barrier at the main entrance to the chamber which is technically not in the upper house .
the commons dividing the two houses is the central lobby - a place where british citizens can come to meet their member of parliament .
the commons side of westminster palace is markedly less ostentatious than the lords and is approached via a corridor off central lobby which leads to the members or commons lobby .
this contains statues of winston churchill , clement attlee and david lloyd george - all notable prime ministers .
curiously mps can still pick up a pinch of snuff from the doorkeeper on their way in - a hangover from past times as are the places where members can hang their swords .
visitors are then taken into the nay lobby where mps walk through when voting against a particular bill or motion .
the other side of the chamber is the aye lobby .
one of the reasons mps still use this archaic system , called a division , is so they can mingle with colleagues as they vote .
two swords ' length to the right of the speaker 's chair are the government benches , currently occupied by labour and to the left are the opposition including the conservatives and the liberal democrats .
the two sides are divided by a space that is exactly two sword-lengths apart - a throwback to the days when weapons were routinely carried .

this is the site of the original commons chamber from 1550 until the fire of 1834 destroyed the building .
nowadays it is not much more than a corridor leading from the street to central lobby , although there are a series of statues of previous parliamentarians .

it was built in the 14th century but incorporated much of the original material from an earlier building on the same site .

in recent years it has seen the laying in state of sir winston churchill and a speech by nelson mandela to both houses of parliament .

they threw eggs and rubbish at the studios of the antenna television station in athens but riot police prevented the demonstrators from entering the building .
it puts a big eye into the lives of people kostas sarris , protestor the protestors said that the show was an attack on privacy in the name of profit .
twelve contestants are set to spend 112 days together in a house filled with cameras while viewers monitor their progress and vote them out of the house one by one .
the last person to leave the house will receive a cash prize of 50m drachmas -lrb- £ 90,000 -rrb- .
profit the demonstrators included anti-globalisation activists such as members of the genoa 2001 protest .
one demonstrator , kostas sarris , told reporters : " the basic problem is that it basically violates the private life of people in the name of profit .
" it puts a big eye into the lives of people . "
there were no arrests or injuries and there appears to have been no damage to the studios .
' human values ' the greek edition of the big brother programme has already encountered opposition from the athens journalists ' union , which earlier this year threatened to discipline any of its members who took part in the show 's production .
the union has said that the programme is " aimed at the erosion of human values " .
big brother , which started on dutch television in 1999 , has inspired a host of other reality tv shows around the world .
france 's version of the show , called loft story , sparked similar controversy some months ago when hundreds of demonstrators left their rubbish outside the tv station in protest .

the research by the charity save the children blames inadequate health care .
it has called on governments to improve access to vaccinations , provide basic hygiene equipment and promote breastfeeding .
causes of new-born death infections 32 % birth complications 29 % prematurity 24 % birth defects 10 % global child death rates have been reduced by 14 % over the past decade .
but charles maccormack , save the children 's president , said new-born death rates remained " staggeringly high " .
the charity studied new-born babies in 163 countries .
its report is published a week before a united nations special session on children in new york .
since the last un children 's meeting in 1990 , deaths among children under five have been slashed by a third .
but save the children hopes this year 's summit will focus on the four million new-born babies who die each year .
mortality rates vary hugely around the world .
in the west african country of mali , 60 new-born babies out of every 1,000 die , compared with only five in 1,000 in the united states .
giving birth without help many woman do not breastfeed part of the problem is that around 53 million women give birth each year without professional help .
save the children has set up a project called saving newborn lives which aims to help improve care for mothers before , during and after birth .
the charity says all mothers should have access to a simple delivery kit that would help limit infection at the birth .
the kit , costing just 35 us cents , would include a plastic sheet , a bar of soap , string to tie the umbilical cord and a razor to cut it .
save the children also says tetanus injections should be available to every pregnant woman to protect her child .
the report said this measure would cost little over a dollar .
breastfeeding it also highlights the pressing need to promote the benefits of breastfeeding .
breast milk not only contains vital nutrients , it also provides babies with protection against disease .
however , there are many cultural barriers to overcome if more women are to breastfeed .
currently 80 % of all new-borns in asia do not suckle within their first 24 hours .
anne tinker , director of saving newborn lives , said : " in south asia , there 's a cultural belief that the first milk is stale and dirty so they feed the baby honeyed tea for a few days .
it 's a terrible waste of nature 's gift .
" by integrating do-able , inexpensive services into existing programmes , we can affect the social and economic well-being of countries for generations to come . "

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- dagestan : rangers ' hard draw categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : europe front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 11 september , 2001 , 09:38 gmt 10:38 uk dagestan : rangers ' hard draw volunteers joined russian troops in repulsing islamic rebels in 1999 by russian affairs analyst stephen dalziel turkish football fans have made a habit of greeting their british counterparts in istanbul in recent years with banners reading , " welcome to hell " .
the players have tended to dismiss this as merely part of the hype surrounding the game .
but for rangers the nightmare came true of a tie in a location so dangerous that british subjects are advised by their government to stay away .
the glasgow team has been ordered by european football 's governing body , uefa , to play its first european match of the season against the russian league team , anzhi , who are from makhachkala in the caucasian republic of dagestan .
it 's become a standing joke in the football world that the expansion of the european champions league and the uefa cup in recent years has seen administrators , players and fans alike scrambling for their atlases when the early round draws are made .
bomb blasts and it would n't have taken rangers long to realise that dagestan is right next to chechnya , where russian forces have been fighting a guerrilla war for the last two years .
rangers players will have to take their own soap the war was launched in september 1999 following incursions into dagestan by chechen rebels .
it was claimed that they wanted to spread the islamic revolution - like chechnya , the population of dagestan is predominantly muslim .
the incursions were repulsed , with moscow 's help .
then there was a series of bomb blasts in blocks of flats , including two in moscow .
these were blamed on the chechens , and the then russian prime minister , vladimir putin , ordered in the troops .
kidnap threat mr putin knew that he was taking a risk .
in 1996 , the russian army had been humiliated in chechnya , and was forced to leave in ignominious defeat , after a badly-organised military campaign which had dragged on for nearly two years .
this time , the authorities had public support .
but two years on , fighting continues , and the region is still highly unstable .
the british foreign office advises strongly against british subjects visiting the northern caucasus , and not just chechnya .
dagestan - and notably , the capital , makhachkala - has witnessed a number of bomb blasts .
and there have also been kidnappings , especially of foreigners .
in the region , " foreigner " equals " rich " , and large ransom demands are made for the return of kidnap victims .
insurance bill security issues have dominated rangers ' preparation for the tie .
and as they 've been given a quotation of $ 10m to insure the team for the trip , that 's hardly surprising .
many dagestanis were forced to flee the conflict zone in 1999 but the situation gets worse .
representatives of the glasgow club who visited makhachkala to check out the facilities , returned with horror stories of how the players would have to take with them soap , toilet paper , bedding and towels .
on the football front , it does n't get any easier for rangers ' dutch manager , dick advocaat .
he 's watched anzhi - one of the lesser-known teams in this season 's european competitions - only on video .
and visa problems meant that his scout , evan chester , was unable to see the team play .
anzhi qualified for this season 's uefa cup by virtue of finishing fourth in the russian league last year .
the good news for the rest of europe is that they wo n't be back next year .
with the russian season heading for its conclusion in november , they lie ninth in the table , well off the top positions .

the incursions were repulsed , with moscow 's help .
then there was a series of bomb blasts in blocks of flats , including two in moscow .
these were blamed on the chechens , and the then russian prime minister , vladimir putin , ordered in the troops .
kidnap threat mr putin knew that he was taking a risk .
in 1996 , the russian army had been humiliated in chechnya , and was forced to leave in ignominious defeat , after a badly-organised military campaign which had dragged on for nearly two years .
this time , the authorities had public support .
but two years on , fighting continues , and the region is still highly unstable .
the british foreign office advises strongly against british subjects visiting the northern caucasus , and not just chechnya .
dagestan - and notably , the capital , makhachkala - has witnessed a number of bomb blasts .
and there have also been kidnappings , especially of foreigners .
in the region , " foreigner " equals " rich " , and large ransom demands are made for the return of kidnap victims .
insurance bill security issues have dominated rangers ' preparation for the tie .
and as they 've been given a quotation of $ 10m to insure the team for the trip , that 's hardly surprising .
but the situation gets worse .
representatives of the glasgow club who visited makhachkala to check out the facilities , returned with horror stories of how the players would have to take with them soap , toilet paper , bedding and towels .
on the football front , it does n't get any easier for rangers ' dutch manager , dick advocaat .
he 's watched anzhi - one of the lesser-known teams in this season 's european competitions - only on video .
and visa problems meant that his scout , evan chester , was unable to see the team play .
anzhi qualified for this season 's uefa cup by virtue of finishing fourth in the russian league last year .
the good news for the rest of europe is that they wo n't be back next year .
with the russian season heading for its conclusion in november , they lie ninth in the table , well off the top positions .

the move has been welcomed by the beleaguered farming industry , but it is unlikely to lead to an early resumption of meat exports .
the disease came north of the border on 1 march , and since then there have been 187 confirmed cases .
the last of them was at the end of may .
after 90 disease-free days restrictions were lifted in most of the country - apart from an area adjacent to the border near gretna and annan affected by restrictions on infected premises in cumbria .
exports to europe are still banned those restrictions have now been lifted .
mr finnie said : " today 's removal of the small remaining infected area around annan is very significant .
all scotland can now be classed as disease free .
" this coincides with the progressing of our case in brussels for the resumption of sheep meat exports from the whole of scotland led by leslie gardner , scotland 's chief veterinary officer .
" this will reinforce the case i put to commissioner byrne when we discussed this matter recently .
" classing the whole of scotland disease free also affords extra protection against the possibility of disease being brought north into scotland by breeding cattle , sheep or pigs .
" it means that any breeding animals coming into scotland now can only come from areas in england and wales which also qualify as free of disease .
" any such movements will be subject to stringent controls involving thorough biosecurity of all vehicles and personnel , veterinary inspection before transit takes place and movement only by designated routes . "
ross finnie welcomed the news but the minister added : " again , this excellent news has to be tempered by a very firm warning .
farmers throughout the length and breadth of scotland must remain on their guard against the prospect of infection being spread . "
as the country was given disease free status the scottish executive was faced with a new call for an independent public inquiry into the h crisis .
the uk government has ordered a series of reports into foot-and-mouth , but not a full independent public inquiry .
now activists are calling on the executive to lead the way by commissioning its own study .
the campaign group advocates for animals - which opposed the mass slaughter policy and supports vaccination of livestock - tabled a motion for debate by the parliament 's petitions committee on tuesday .

the inter-american democratic charter compels the oas to take action against any member state that disrupts its own democratic institutions .
we still face enormous challenges in a series of countries oas secretary-general critics say it does not go far enough to protect the future of the region 's fragile democracies .
but the oas secretary-general , cesar gaviria , who opened the ceremony , said the democratic charter would provide the instruments to defend the citizens ' rights in all the countries of the continent .
mr gaviria 's opening speech was blunt .
he told his audience of diplomats and foreign ministers that they were doing nothing less than enshrining the region 's fragile democracies in a protective cloak .
" by adopting this democratic charter , you are putting on notice all of an authoritarian bent that there will be no tolerance towards those who would overthrow governments , seek to subvert the constitutional order or undermine political control . "
the new charter was , he said , a significant change from the days when the oas would stand back and watch would-be dictators chip away at democratic institutions from the inside .
the peruvians know the problem well .
they coined the phrase " disguised dictatorship " to describe the way their former president alberto fujimori pulled apart democracy to protect his power .
it was the post-fujimori government in peru that came up with the idea of the democratic charter .
it wanted an institutional way of tackling this kind of abuse , should it ever happen again , and mr gaviria admitted that there was still every chance that it could .
" democracy has not yet been established once and for all in the americas , and we still face enormous challenges in a series of countries , " he said .
but the charter may still not be enough .
critics on the fringes of the meeting said the document leaves room for the oas to wriggle out of action as it has in the past , if it lacks the political will .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- drug to prevent diabetes categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 11 september , 2001 , 10:46 gmt 11:46 uk drug to prevent diabetes diabetes is becoming increasingly common a drug designed to delay or help prevent high-risk patients from developing type 2 diabetes has produced promising results in trials .
the drug , rosiglitazone , is marketed by uk pharmaceutical firm glaxosmithkline plc under the brand name avandia .
dr mark walker , of newcastle university , told the european association for the study of diabetes conference in glasgow that it had proved effective in preventing the disease in patients with impaired glucose tolerance -lrb- igt -rrb- .
preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes may become crucial in trying to tackle the impending epidemic that we face diabetes uk patients with igt have higher than normal blood glucose levels , which puts them at increased risk of diabetes .
diabetes is caused by the body 's inability to process sugar in the blood .
the breakdown of sugar is controlled by the hormone insulin .
diabetics either do not produce enough insulin , or are resistant to its effects .
igt also contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease .
increased exercise and diet can also help prevent people with igt from developing diabetes but for elderly and disabled patients it may not be an option .
dr walker said : " the results from this small study are extremely encouraging as they demonstrate that rosiglitazone provides significant improvements to insulin resistance , blood pressure and igt .
" this drug therefore presents a therapeutic alternative for those patients that can not make the necessary lifestyle changes . "
side effects glaxosmithkline added a warning to labels on avandia in february after clinical trails showed a higher rate of heart failure and cardiac-related problems in people taking the drug with insulin .
another drug in the same class , rezulin , was pulled from the us market after it linked to liver problems .
dr walker 's team studied the effects of rosiglitazone on 18 igt patients who received either the drug or a placebo .
patients who took the drug showed an improvement in their glucose and insulin levels .
dr walker said : " a key consideration from the study results is that rosiglitazone appears to ameliorate insulin resistance in the pre-diabetic state .
" this could be of potential benefit in actually preventing the development of type 2 diabetes . "
diabetes is linked to a range of other conditions including kidney failure , strokes , heart disease , blindness and nerve damage .
bill hartnet , of diabetes uk , told bbc news online : " these results are interesting , but we would be hesitant about getting too excited at this early stage .

the drug , rosiglitazone , is marketed by uk pharmaceutical firm glaxosmithkline plc under the brand name avandia .
dr mark walker , of newcastle university , told the european association for the study of diabetes conference in glasgow that it had proved effective in preventing the disease in patients with impaired glucose tolerance -lrb- igt -rrb- .
preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes may become crucial in trying to tackle the impending epidemic that we face diabetes uk patients with igt have higher than normal blood glucose levels , which puts them at increased risk of diabetes .
diabetes is caused by the body 's inability to process sugar in the blood .
the breakdown of sugar is controlled by the hormone insulin .
diabetics either do not produce enough insulin , or are resistant to its effects .
igt also contributes to the development of cardiovascular disease .
increased exercise and diet can also help prevent people with igt from developing diabetes but for elderly and disabled patients it may not be an option .
dr walker said : " the results from this small study are extremely encouraging as they demonstrate that rosiglitazone provides significant improvements to insulin resistance , blood pressure and igt .
" this drug therefore presents a therapeutic alternative for those patients that can not make the necessary lifestyle changes . "
side effects glaxosmithkline added a warning to labels on avandia in february after clinical trails showed a higher rate of heart failure and cardiac-related problems in people taking the drug with insulin .
another drug in the same class , rezulin , was pulled from the us market after it linked to liver problems .
dr walker 's team studied the effects of rosiglitazone on 18 igt patients who received either the drug or a placebo .
patients who took the drug showed an improvement in their glucose and insulin levels .
dr walker said : " a key consideration from the study results is that rosiglitazone appears to ameliorate insulin resistance in the pre-diabetic state .
" this could be of potential benefit in actually preventing the development of type 2 diabetes . "
diabetes is linked to a range of other conditions including kidney failure , strokes , heart disease , blindness and nerve damage .
bill hartnet , of diabetes uk , told bbc news online : " these results are interesting , but we would be hesitant about getting too excited at this early stage .
" increasingly the possibility of preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes may become crucial in trying to tackle the impending epidemic that we face . "

french economic output , or gdp , grew by only 0.3 % in the april-to-june quarter , statistics office insee said .
for the moment there is absolutely no sign of a turnaround emmanuel ferry , economist , exane in the first three months of the year , gdp grew at a revised 0.4 % .
" this figure confirms that there was a slowdown but that france is doing better than its main partners in the eurozone , " said nicolas claquin , an economist at ccf in paris .
recent figures showed germany 's gdp was unchanged in the second quarter compared with the first , while italy saw gdp decline 0.1 % over the same period .
consumer confidence one of the reasons given for the relative strength of the french economy of late has been a buoyant consumer sector .

" the impact of the global slowdown on the french economy will continue to be felt in 2002 . "
despite the bad news , bank of france governor jean claude trichet said on tuesday that growth could rise slightly in the fourth quarter to 0.4 % .
but he added that he was " very cautious " on this forecast , and that all projections were under constant reviewed .
he also said that he saw the eurozone block gdp growing by 2 % this year .

commander masood was killed in a suicide bomb attack at his headquarters in a garrison town in the northern province of takhar .
the bbc afghanistan correspondent , kate clark , says it is difficult to over-estimate how serious a blow his death has dealt to the alliance .
militarily , he was the lynchpin for anti-taleban forces .
he was also the opposition leader whose reputation had best survived 20 years of war .
soviet war a follower of radical islamic politics as a young man , ahmed shah masood went on to become one of the most successful mujahadeen commanders in the fight against the soviet invasion of the 1980s .
after the mujahadeen captured the afghan capital , kabul , in 1992 , commander masood was appointed defence minister .
there were many allegations at the time of corruption and cronyism in his ministry .
the government was to fall apart anyway as the various factions fought a bitter internecine war for control of kabul .
commander masood 's jamiat-i-islami , like the others , rocketed civilian areas causing massive destruction .
tens of thousands of people died in the bombardments or fled the city .
after withdrawing from kabul in 1996 in the face of the advancing taleban , his forces have gradually been pushed back into the north-east of the country .
' civil and postive ' the bbc 's former kabul correspondent , william reeve , met commander masood on several occasions .
" he seemed to always have a very clear idea in his mind as to what he wanted , " he said .
" it was just difficult for him in the messy civil war always to get his way . "
william reeve described commander masood as being very civil during their meetings .
" he always arrived looking spick and span with a jump in his step .
he was very positive .
" he usually talked about the fighting and how he saw it was going to transpire . "
reinforced this year , commander masood 's alliance was strengthened by the return of several significant military leaders to afghanistan .
they include the uzbek commander , general dostum and the former governor of herat , ismail khan , who escaped from a taleban jail last year .
so far , despite some intense fighting , neither side has gained much territory .
but the loss of ahmed shah masood could push the balance , perhaps decisively , in the taleban 's favour .

he is also the opposition leader whose reputation has best survived 20 years of war .
soviet war a follower of radical islamic politics as a young man , ahmed shah masood went on to become one of the most successful mujahadeen commanders in the fight against the soviet invasion of the 1980s .
after the mujahadeen captured the afghan capital , kabul , in 1992 , commander masood was appointed defence minister .
there were many allegations at the time of corruption and cronyism in his ministry .
the government was to fall apart anyway as the various factions fought a bitter internecine war for control of kabul .
general dostum has returned to the anti-taleban alliance commander masood 's jamiat-i-islami , like the others , rocketed civilian areas causing massive destruction .
tens of thousands of people died in the bombardments or fled the city .
after withdrawing from kabul in 1996 in the face of the advancing taleban , his forces have gradually been pushed back into the north-east of the country .
' civil and postive ' the bbc 's former kabul correspondent , william reeve , met commander masood on several occasions .
" he seemed to always have a very clear idea in his mind as to what he wanted , " he said .
" it was just difficult for him in the messy civil war always to get his way . "
william reeve described commander masood as being very civil during their meetings .
" he always arrived looking spick and span with a jump in his step .
he was very positive .
" he usually talked about the fighting and how he saw it was going to transpire . "
reinforced this year , commander masood 's alliance has been strengthened by the return of several significant military leaders to afghanistan .
they include the uzbek commander , general dostum and the former governor of herat , ismail khan , who escaped from a taleban jail last year .
so far , despite some intense fighting , neither side has gained much territory .
but the loss of ahmed shah masood would push the balance , perhaps decisively , in the taleban 's favour .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- is it right to ban smacking ?
categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 11 september , 2001 , 11:04 gmt 12:04 uk is it right to ban smacking ?
the scottish government wants to ban parents from smacking children under the age of three .
the proposals will also see a ban on corporal punishment by other carers of small children .
currently , the law prohibits " unreasonable chastisement " of children .
the scottish justice minister , jim wallace , says the new rules with help the courts decide what reasonable chastisement is .
but the move has been criticised as " misconceived and unnecessary " by scottish conservatives , who see it as part of the government 's " insatiable desire to legislate " .
is this legislation necessary ?
will it protect children from violence or simply interfere with the rights of parents to impose discipline ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction this sort of chastisement is most likely to cause physical damage alison , uk i agree that banning all smacking is over-legislation .
however , i do agree that no child should ever be smacked on the head or shaken , and so criminalising this would be a good idea .
this sort of chastisement is most likely to cause physical damage , and anyone with common sense ought to be able to see that .
alison , uk banning smacking is only a good idea if parents are taught alternative means of behaviour correction .
otherwise , parenting becomes even more difficult .
kevin , uk if a parent can be taken to court if they smack a child , can a child be taken to court if they kick , bite , hit or abuse their parents ?
caron , uk i know first-hand that child abuse is very real .
a law that makes hitting punishable would send a strong message to parents to try other ways to discipline .
i have two children and think perhaps government funded education of some sort would help parents combat any anger-management issues they may have and learn a better way to discipline .
lisa , usa those times have been rare but appropriate k. jones , usa i have raised one child and am in the process of raising three more .
i have , on occasion swatted all of them .
those times have been rare but appropriate .
they are all great kids and i do n't believe our relationships could be better .
i am glad most of your readers have enough common sense to know the difference between discipline and abuse .
k. jones , usa i personally believe there are many ways to punish a child that do n't involve physical violence .
violence of any form has no place in a modern society .
alex white , uk nobody is in favour of abusing children in any way - but a smack is n't abuse .
raising doubts about the legality of a wee smack is going to bring nightmarish problems .
children need protection and parents need support .
this proposal , if it comes to law , will bring in far more problems then it solves , and we 'll regret it .
it 's one of those over-simple " it feels right so let 's do it " ideas .
tim , scotland for a long time here in sweden smacking has been equal to assault .
the kids who get smacked can call a help-line to talk about their problems .
richard , sweden whenever i smacked my child it always came from any frustration i was then going through .
i would regret it later , but always think of the maxim " spare the rod and spoil the child " .
given our children 's lax attitude to life today , would not some discipline help tomorrow 's grown-up ?
athena , malta not good but not criminal janice , england making criminals of parents who smack is not they way forward .
heaven help the social work profession -lrb- to which i belong -rrb- and the police child protection teams if we have to treat all parents who smack as criminals .
smacking is not the best way to provide good discipline - but many normal parents -lrb- including me -rrb- have smacked their children at times .
not good but not criminal .
janice , england if smacking is banned it should also be acceptable for anyone who becomes a victim of out-of-control children to sue the government department who implement the ban .
ben jacobs , uk i feel smacking can be very effective .
just the other day , a gentleman cut me off while i was driving .
well , i chased him down and as soon as he got out of his car , i put him over my knee and gave him a couple of good smacks on the bottom .
that 'll be the last time he cuts another driver off .
chris daniel , us i think there is nothing wrong with smacking a child , as long as it is within limits .
my dad used to smack me for justified reasons and i think it made me a better person .
zeryab , canada some parents ca n't tell the difference between smacking and beating , so i say ban all physical violence against children .
what are we , a nation of child abusers ?
nesta , scotland as far as she is concerned being sent to her room is far worse a punishment than being smacked stephen , scotland before i was a father i thought that smacking a child was necessary .
now i have a 7-year-old daughter and have found , over time , that smacking does not work .
as far as she is concerned being sent to her room is far worse a punishment than being smacked .
the time alone in her room makes her think about what she has done , something a smack would not get her to do .
stephen , scotland the new law is a waste of time and money .
how do you expect to enforce such a law .
there are bigger issues in scotland , and the world today that need our immediate attention .
i have two boys below the age of three , and occasionally they get a smack on the wrist or legs .
it seems the people making these latest proposals could do with some of the same .
stuart dawson , welshman living in hong kong there 's a world of difference between beating a child and an occasional smack .
i believe that smacking should only be used when reasoned argument has been tried and failed , but children are not always reasonable , and a short sharp shock is often the best way to bring a child out of a tantrum .
i always felt that smacking was a much more effective punishment than , say depriving a child of a meal as some of my anti-smacking neighbours did .
no amount of reasoning will teach a small child not to touch something that is hot , and a smack hurts less than a burn .
nicola , uk political correctness has taken over the asylum peter nixon , usa / uk political correctness has taken over the asylum and put the lunatic fringe to the front .
spare the rod and spoil the child was the norm , that did not mean beat them to a pulp , it means simply correction by the last means , all else having failed .
is it any small wonder there are young children and teenagers today who have no sense of values , until caught and hauled to juvenile court , when they plead their age and say they did not know it was wrong ?
who is kidding who ?
peter nixon , usa / uk let 's get a sense of perspective on this : the occasional smack is not violent , nor is it abuse , nor is it assault .
it is an effective way of temporarily correcting a child 's behaviour .
it has no long-term effects at all .
the reason you should be allowed to smack a child but not an adult is because a child is incapable of judging effectively for itself whether or not its behaviour is right or wrong .
yes , children have no ' political power ' - quite right too !
they do n't have the capacity to exercise it intelligently .
daniel , uk violence comes naturally to kids .
it is not a learned response .
my own son never witnessed violence -lrb- we had no tv and there was no family violence -rrb- yet he was perfectly capable of it by ten months when he split my lip with a head-butt .
he got his first smack after that .
-lrb- i had planned never to smack him . -rrb-
while i am sure it is better to model and to teach other ways of solving problems throughout childhood and adolescence , who can reason with a pre-verbal child ?
a quick smack whenever my son tried something dangerous was the only effective means of communicating that he definitely should n't do that .
a law like this will not address child abuse , and will make normal parents criminals .
pam rosengren , australia a child is , like the rest us , constantly learning the limits of tolerance chee choong , malaysia a child is , like the rest us , constantly learning the limits of tolerance .
more so it is important when he / she has to live in a community of people .
just because one declares an act to be unacceptable does not necessarily impart a child with the capacity nor the inclination to realise it .
so it is as a last and effective resort that corrective action -lrb- such as smacking or the promise of the use of it -rrb- which is instinctively understood even by a child , be delivered .
used in a controlled and directed manner , there 's no reason why smacking should not be part of a parent 's educational tool for his / her child 's healthy and balanced upbringing .
chee choong , malaysia as i understand it , smacking is not a " violent act " , neither is it to be used when running out of patience .
i think it is one effective way of disciplining children , especially when they can not understand reason .
i think smacking is effective not because it inflicts pain -lrb- surely no-one can advocate beating children -rrb- , but because it is humbling and a strong signal that certain behaviour is unacceptable .
when i was smacked as a child i felt ashamed , and i have nothing but love and respect for my parents now .
victor , uk the hysteria concerning child abuse is still raging and moving to ridiculous levels .
whatever next ?
will punishing a child by not letting them out during the evening be classed as unlawful imprisonment ?
parents need the freedom to punish their children in a way they see fit .
some children do n't respond to reasonable discussion and physical punishment is sometimes the only sensible option .
we need to pass on a clear message to children that they need to conform to rules otherwise suffer the consequences .
if we fail to do so then crime will naturally increase as a consequence .
steve , uk the discipline of children by smacking has helped to create the ordered society we have today kevin millican , england the discipline of children by smacking - for hundreds of generations and thousands of years - has helped to create the ordered society we have today .
over the past 30-40 years in the west , we 've seen a marked reduction in the physical discipline of children as a result of so-called ' expert ' advice .
this should be more than enough time to see if reducing / eliminating smacking leads to a less violent world .
is this what we see ? - i think not .
kevin millican , england political correctness has taken over the asylum and put the lunatic fringe to the front .
spare the rod and spoil the child was the norm , that did not mean beat them to a pulp , it means simply correction by the last means , all else having failed .
is it any small wonder there are young children and teenagers today who have no sense of values , until caught and hauled to juvenile court , when they plead their age and say they did not know it was wrong ?
who is kidding who ?
peter nixon , usa / uk i can not see how this ban on smacking would be policed paul j , uk i can not see how this ban on smacking would be policed .
if it serves only to create a yardstick by which courts make judgements , then the " red tape " argument banded about by the scottish conservatives is misplaced .
surely this will remove an element of the subjective nature from such decisions and give a fairer result .
paul j , uk of course the ban is right , and should be in place for all children , not just the under threes .
if society thinks that teaching a child that a violent act is the way to solve a problem , then society is crazy .
aside from this , the pain inflicted is sickening .
parents who physically strike or harm any child should be charged with child abuse .
rodd garr , usa i do n't support violence against children , but a smacked bottom did n't do me any harm , and it did n't do my children any harm .
it was n't intended as a violent act , but as a firm signal that some lines must not be crossed .
children need lines to be drawn , and they ca n't always be drawn by discussion .
john , scotland i am totally baffled as to how these ridiculous proposals actually get taken seriously .
the idea that legislation like this will actually work is ludicrous .
once again the do-gooders manage to influence politicians .
when will the politicians realise that standing up against nonsense like this will actually win votes .
we , the general public , have finally had enough of politically correct twaddle andy bell , uk the occasional smack is not child abuse richard , australia anybody with young children knows that it is in a child 's nature to push parents to establish what they can get away with and what they can not .
the occasional smack is not child abuse -lrb- a thoroughly repugnant accusation -rrb- , it is a means of establishing these boundaries .
i am not saying that everybody should smack their children - far from it - but undisciplined children eventually become somebody else 's problem too - their school 's - and these days , teachers are so limited in their powers to discipline pupils .
richard , australia in response to claire 's comments ; to say that there is so much violence in the world because of smacking is more than a little simplistic , and to say that smacking takes place because children " have no political power " is nothing short of absurd .
perhaps she could explain how a child who is prone to temper tantrums and will not listen to reason could be afforded a degree of political power ?
does she seriously think that the misbehaving child who gets a smack will extract from this the sweeping principle that " violence is a good way to solve problems " and carry this principle into action on a grand scale in their own lives ?
christopher kelly , uk future generations will be better off if they learn to manage the behaviour of their children without resorting to physically beating them .
the love and comfort we bring to our children is seriously compromised when we start smacking .
it is quite understandable that people in charge of young children feel the overwhelming urge to clout a child who is trying their patience .
but if we accept the principle that this represents a failure not a solution , then in the end the whole of society would benefit from a growing generation who have been brought up in an atmosphere of non-violence .
philip s hall , england , uk the only person qualified to smack under 3 year-olds is the midwife .
jan , uk smacking a child is not a means to wilfully or maliciously inflicting harm on them .
most times it 's the last course of action taken to making them know that what they are doing is wrong and it should be stop immediately .
for most parents in the uk , i 'm sure that smacking is a necessary and vital part of bringing your child in the way they should grow .
i was smacked , many times , and hold no animosity towards my parents .
vere , england a well-deserved smack followed by an explanation and a hug is still the best parental guidance in the world .
the inability to differentiate between discipline and child abuse is typical of an out-of-touch bureaucracy .
robert del valle , usa this society says we have freedom , but it constantly tells us what do , how to bring our children up , what we wear , how we are to worship , how we are to dress and eat .
they say smacking is against the human rights of a child , but i say smacking gives the child boundaries .
you can not discipline a child with hugs and kisses , you have to use force once in a while .
if children are not disciplined then we will bringing up children that will have no respect for themselves or any one else .
darren sharrocks , reading the responses of people here , it is no wonder that there is so much violence in the world .
when people smack their children , they teach them that violence is a good way to solve problems .
the hypocrisy is also astonishing .
if a person " smacks " a stranger , he can be arrested for assault .
yet , he is allowed to hit his child .
why ?
because children have no political power .
this is undoubtedly one of society 's worse evils .
