afghanistan is a critical country right next to iran and bush wants a friendly government there , " he said .
" the us ignores terrorism in africa and elsewhere .
why ?
because there 's no oil . "
the international action center which helped organise the march says that us oil companies want to build a pipeline from the oil-rich caspian sea to the indian ocean - through afghanistan - and this is why the bush administration is trying to topple the taleban .
organisers also condemned the " racist " arrest of hundreds of muslims and arabs in the us and elsewhere since 11 september and voiced concern that the anti-terrorism act , made into law on friday would be used to intimidate government critics such as themselves .

new housing data reveals a marked slowdown in both price rises and activity across all regions of england and wales in the first comprehensive national housing survey published since 11 september .
fears of terrorism have combined with worries about a pending recession to knock consumer confidence , which in turn appears to have stalled the rising trend in house prices seen over the past five years john wriglesworth , hometrack 's economist worst-hit are parts of the southeast and london , where prices stagnated or fell during october .
the data from hometrack , a monthly housing market survey , also indicates that the market has moved more in favour of buyers in many parts of the country .
nationally , there are almost 20 % more properties for sale than active registered buyers , which suggests that further house price falls could be on the agenda .
worst hit in general , counties with higher than average property values , and with the most densely populated areas , have seen the most marked slowdown .
with the exception of north yorkshire , the bottom five performing " small " regions are in the southeast : london and the city , surrey , oxfordshire and berkshire .
worst hit were properties in central london , where prices fell by 0.8 % on average - a marked difference to june when prices rose by 0.7 % .
bottom five performing ' small ' regions central london & city : -0.8 % surrey : -0.4 % oxfordshire : -0.3 % north yorkshire : 0.2 % berkshire : -0.2 % hometrack 's latest index , which surveyed 4,000 estate agents nationwide in the month up to october , said that confidence in the economy and fear of redundancy was " rippling-out " from expensive central london areas to the commuter belt .
estate agents in surrey reported a " domino effect from london " where prices fell on average by 0.4 % over the last month .
the typical price of a three-bedroomed terraced property was £ 134,500 , compared to £ 138,800 in june - a fall of £ 4,300 .
why did they fall ?

buyers ' market john wriglesworth , hometrack 's housing economist , said : " fears of terrorism have combined with worries about a pending recession to knock consumer confidence , which in turn appears to have stalled the rising trend in house prices seen over the past five years . "
in many parts of the country , properties have been taking longer to sell than a few months ago .
in east anglia it took on average four weeks to sell a property in july , but this has now increased to 4.6 weeks .
in greater london property , is now taking an average of 4.2 weeks to sell , compared to 3.6 in june .
and the number of properties on the market this month has exceeded the number of active buyers registered by 20 % on average .
as a consequence , some sellers have had to drop their sale prices .
nationally the price achieved as a percentage of the asking price has fallen by 0.7 % over the last month or from 97.5 % to 95 % .
boom areas counties with lower than average house prices - below £ 117,000 - have been more resilient .

even in london , there were some differences .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- broadsheets uneasy at military campaign categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 28 october , 2001 , 08:21 gmt broadsheets uneasy at military campaign a sense of growing unease at the direction of the military campaign against taleban-held afghanistan is apparent in all the broadsheets .
the independent on sunday says tony blair will try to rally support at home in " almost churchillian tones " , while a grim realisation sets in that the campaign will be a " long and messy affair " .
the paper notes that while there is scant sign the squabbling factions opposed to the taleban are about to unite , hopes that moderate taleban would defect have proved unfounded .
" why ca n't they find where he is hiding ? " asks the sunday times on the efforts to trace the chief suspect for the attacks on 11 september .
it agrees that the carefully devised military strategy is in trouble .
the paper thinks the most formidable manhunt ever assembled has been reduced to chasing shadows .
it says : " the monster is now a ghost and he is beginning to scare american planners who thought they could find him . "
in an editorial , the observer , argues the politicians have brought a crisis of confidence upon themselves , suggesting that " confusion maybe exactly what is going on in the minds of our leaders " .
winning words in contrast , the news of the world uses a winston churchill quotation in its attempt to rally support for the present action .
it admits that war is never easy , but remembers the former prime minister 's words shortly after the outbreak of world war ii : " you ask what is our aim ?
" i can answer in one word , it is victory , victory at all costs " .
the paper declares " we must not allow faint hearts to unnerve us " .
it adds that however " long the military campaign endures , we must not falter in our determination to confront the afghan rulers and the barbarous terrorists they shelter " .
other headline stories : a fierce attack on the former director general of the bbc lord birt is launched in the sunday times - by the man who gave him the job .
the corporation 's former chairman marmaduke hussey , whose memoirs are serialised in the paper , said lord birt did not have the skills to get along with staff or manage them .
the paper says the pair finally fell out in 1995 before the broadcast of martin bashir 's revealing interview with diana , princess of wales .
" i do not think the bbc should have got itself into a position involving the private problems of the royal family " mr hussey said , " that is not what the bbc is about " .
the paper points out the programme was probably rather awkward for lord hussey , whose wife was , and still is , a lady-in-waiting to the queen .
lie-in no more those enjoying a sunday lie-in are part of a dwindling minority according to the sunday express .
it seems that almost 80 % of the country are up and about by 0900gmt .
a fifth are working , while others play sport or use the time for supermarket shopping .
only 6 % are planning to go to church .
it is people in south-east england who are most active .
those in the north-east of england take the tradition of the lie-in more seriously .
seventy per cent refuse to get out of bed before 1100gmt .

the independent on sunday says tony blair will try to rally support at home in " almost churchillian tones " , while a grim realisation sets in that the campaign will be a " long and messy affair " .
the paper notes that while there is scant sign the squabbling factions opposed to the taleban are about to unite , hopes that moderate taleban would defect have proved unfounded .
" why ca n't they find where he is hiding ? " asks the sunday times on the efforts to trace the chief suspect for the attacks on 11 september .
it agrees that the carefully devised military strategy is in trouble .
the paper thinks the most formidable manhunt ever assembled has been reduced to chasing shadows .
it says : " the monster is now a ghost and he is beginning to scare american planners who thought they could find him . "
in an editorial , the observer , argues the politicians have brought a crisis of confidence upon themselves , suggesting that " confusion maybe exactly what is going on in the minds of our leaders " .
winning words in contrast , the news of the world uses a winston churchill quotation in its attempt to rally support for the present action .
it admits that war is never easy , but remembers the former prime minister 's words shortly after the outbreak of world war ii : " you ask what is our aim ?
" i can answer in one word , it is victory , victory at all costs " .
the paper declares " we must not allow faint hearts to unnerve us " .
it adds that however " long the military campaign endures , we must not falter in our determination to confront the afghan rulers and the barbarous terrorists they shelter " .
other headline stories : a fierce attack on the former director general of the bbc lord birt is launched in the sunday times - by the man who gave him the job .
the corporation 's former chairman marmaduke hussey , whose memoirs are serialised in the paper , said lord birt did not have the skills to get along with staff or manage them .
the paper says the pair finally fell out in 1995 before the broadcast of martin bashir 's revealing interview with diana , princess of wales .
" i do not think the bbc should have got itself into a position involving the private problems of the royal family " mr hussey said , " that is not what the bbc is about " .
the paper points out the programme was probably rather awkward for lord hussey , whose wife was , and still is , a lady-in-waiting to the queen .
lie-in no more those enjoying a sunday lie-in are part of a dwindling minority according to the sunday express .
it seems that almost 80 % of the country are up and about by 0900gmt .
a fifth are working , while others play sport or use the time for supermarket shopping .
only 6 % are planning to go to church .
it is people in south-east england who are most active .
those in the north-east of england take the tradition of the lie-in more seriously .
seventy per cent refuse to get out of bed before 1100gmt .

exports to the far east were up almost a third in the first half of the year , said the scotch whisky association .
the association revealed the value of far east markets had risen by more than 20 % and that volume had gone up 32.8 % .
in south korea shipments grew by almost 40 % in volume - the equivalent of 6.4 million bottles - and more than 30 % by value to £ 80.5m.
other figures in the association 's report include : japanese market volume grew by more than 14.5m bottles , but low value bulk shipments meant the increase in value was only £ 13m exports to the european union were up 7.9 % on last year - 14.3m bottles - delivering a 4.9 % increase in value to £ 16m in the uk , volumes rose by 4.3 % to 46m bottles overall worldwide exports enjoyed double-digit growth , climbing 11.2 % in volume and 10.3 % in value .
the association said export trade was lower than normal early last year as retailers ran down their millennium stocks .
taking this into account , they said a more representative figure would be that from june 2000 to june 2001 , which puts volume up 8 % and value up 6 % .
japanese market volume grew scotch whisky association chairman ian good said it was an encouraging start to the year .
he said : " there was much talk of global recession , even in the first half of the year , yet scotch whisky has seen growth in many of its key markets .
" the renaissance in asia is especially encouraging .
" the asian economic crisis of 1998 left a legacy of low consumer confidence , so this upturn in demand may signal a return to form for one of the industry 's most important markets .
" like many others the industry is watching carefully for any change in consumer expenditures . "
mr good was optimistic the figures would continue to improve .
he said : " the festive season is now fast approaching , which is by far the industry 's busiest time of the year .
" we hope that consumer confidence will hold steady in the final quarter , and allow us to build on these positive half year results . "
