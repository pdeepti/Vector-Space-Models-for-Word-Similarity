mr bush was speaking after meeting his chinese counterpart , jiang zemin , in advance of asia pacific economic co-operation summit in shanghai .
i think the first priority is , of course , for jiang zemin to look me in the eye , take the measure of the american president george w bush it is the first time president bush has travelled overseas since the 11 september terrorist attacks and the first time he has met the chinese leader .
mr bush said he was satisfied with the level of chinese co-operation in the battle against osama bin laden , chief suspect of the 11 september terrorist attacks , and his al-qaeda network .
' no hesitation ' " there was no hesitation , there was no doubt they 'd stand with our people during this terrible time , " mr bush said .
mr jiang said china was willing to work to develop a " constructive relationship " with the united states .
" we have a common understanding of the magnitude of the threat posed by international terrorism , " president jiang said .
" we hope that anti-terrorism efforts can have clearly defined targets and also should hit accurately and also avoid innocent casualties . "
the common fight against terrorism looks set to improve relations between the two countries , damaged by the nato bombing of the chinese embassy in belgrade two years ago , and by a row over a us spy plane earlier this year .
china is worried about islamic separatists in its far western provinces .
apec members australia brunei canada chile china hong kong indonesia japan malaysia mexico new zealand papua new guinea peru philippines russia singapore south korea taiwan thailand united states vietnam speaking before the meeting , president bush emphasised personal chemistry .
he said it would be a chance for president jiang to look him in the eye and take the measure of the american president .
ahead of the meeting , white house officials said china 's co-operation against terrorism has been good .
they cited chinese support at the united nations and its decision to close its border with afghanistan .
a bbc correspondent in shanghai says trade issues , human rights and america 's persistent complaints about china 's proliferation of weapons technology were also likely to have come up during the talks , which lasted two hours .
the us has said there will be no quid pro quo for china 's continuing support in the war on terrorism .
but washington 's need for international backing clearly gives beijing a better bargaining position .
in a sign of improving relations , us secretary of state colin powell has already back-tracked on the bush administration 's early description of china as a strategic competitor , saying the relationship is too complex to capture in a single phrase or slogan .
taiwan the apec meeting was overshadowed by news that taiwan was pulling out .
a member of the taiwanese delegation blamed china for not inviting taipei 's chosen nominee to the meeting .
apec summits are a regular source of friction between the two governments .
taiwan , which china views as a renegade province , has taken part in previous meetings under the title chinese taipei so as not to offend china 's sensitivities about its claim of sovereignty over the island .
terrorism accord apec ministers were due to release a resolution condemning terrorism as a " fight between justice and evil " .
but the document did not go as far as the us hoped , failing to mention the attacks on afghanistan .
apec has always been unhappy when dragged into political arguments , seeing itself as little more than a regional trade body .

taiwanese officials accused china of irrational behaviour and unfairness in its refusal to issue a formal invitation to the island 's former vice-president , li yuan-zu .
he was nominated by the taiwanese government to represent the island at the leaders ' meeting , but beijing , which does not recognise taiwan as a nation in its own right , appears to have seen him as too politically sensitive .
china made it clear that it believed taiwan should follow the example of previous apec meetings at which it has been represented by non-politicians or lower-level ministers in charge of economic affairs .
china is also thought to have been angered by the fact that taiwan 's president , chen shui-bian , originally suggested that he himself should attend the meeting .
beijing is deeply suspicious of mr chen , who it regards as a supporter of taiwanese independence .
taiwan reaction the current row may reflect china 's desire to teach him a lesson for breaching what it sees as apec protocol .
taiwan 's economics minister has been present at an apec ministers ' meeting in shanghai this week , but he was very publicly over-ruled by china 's foreign minister , tang jiaxuan , at a news conference on thursday .
when the taiwanese official tried to express his opinions on who should represent the island , mr tang abruptly cut him off , saying he did not want to waste time talking about the issue .
president chen , speaking in taipei , made it clear that he believed the unprecedented row could damage cross-straits relations .
he said china 's behaviour had hurt the feelings of the island 's people and taiwan could not allow its dignity to be trampled on .

ofac powers ofac has the authority to impose corporate and personal fines up to $ 1m , prison sentences of 12 years , civil penalties of up to $ 250,000 as well as forfeiture of funds and property involved in a violation .
but the us treasury agency enforcing president george w bush 's orders to block the assets of afghanistan 's taleban rulers , osama bin laden and his al-qaeda has itself a less than transparent record .
the office of foreign asset control -lrb- ofac -rrb- claims on its website it has in recent years " imposed fines of millions of dollars in civil penalties involving payments and exports " .
hundreds of companies have been affected , many inadvertently , and have little legal recourse .
but unlike other financial regulators , such as the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- and the federal trade commission -lrb- ftc -rrb- , the little-known ofac never reveals who is fined or why .
" we would n't post that publicly , " a us treasury spokeswoman told bbc news online " i do n't know if it is for privacy reasons but if the party reveals they have been fined , that 's fine . "
she suggested filing a freedom of information suit to gain the information .
ofac has powers to freeze funds of individuals , organisations and countries implicated in terrorism or drug trafficking , and fining individuals and organisations trading with them , including us tourists .
but the us treasury estimates that between one third and half of all ofac violations occur at banks .
key case one individual who objected to his funds being frozen was saudi businessman salah idris .
his el shifa pharmaceutical factory in sudan was destroyed by 13 us cruise missiles in 1998 for , it was alleged , making chemical weapons for osama bin laden .
even though mr idris did not appear on any ofac list , about $ 24m held in bank of america accounts in the uk and jersey was frozen and only released 18 months later when he sued the us treasury .
by releasing the money , the us government effectively cleared mr idris of the terrorism charges .
but officials maintained they only did so maintain the integrity of intelligence sources .
the us treasury spokeswoman could not explain how mr idris could have had his assets frozen by ofac without appearing on their list .

the board of deputies of british jews said it was symptomatic of a long-term failure to prosecute anti-semitic literature under public order legislation .
it said there was little point in framing fresh legislation against religious hatred if existing laws were not used .
the five men were arrested a year ago at the beginning of the latest palestinian uprising , the intifada .
the leaflets were handed out at stamford hill in north london - an area with a large orthodox jewish population .
they said : " the final hour will not come until the muslims kill the jews . "
police sources cited in the jewish chronicle said the decision not to prosecute was taken because the material was handed out in a single area , was targeted only at the jewish community , and there was considered to be little or no likelihood of its causing civil unrest .
leader watched the leaflets were produced by a group associated with al muhajiroun , a radical muslim group with a strong british base .
it is led in the uk by sheikh omar bakri muhammad , who is also under police investigation for recent comments .
home secretary david blunkett recently told the bbc the authorities were studying him closely .
" we monitor carefully everything that he is saying , who he is inciting , and work out carefully at what point it would be productive to act so he is prevented from doing so , " he said .

publisher bloomsbury has reported a surge in recent profits , thanks to sales generated by harry potter .
harry 's success story is the stuff of every publisher 's dreams .
carey 's booker win is set to become a bestseller increasingly , publishing companies are trying to understand how to create a bestseller and , as a result , are spending more energy marketing fewer titles .
no doubt faber , the publisher of the new booker prize winner , peter carey 's " true history of the kelly gang " , will be ramping up its marketing machine for another big push .
" big books have got bigger , " says ian taylor , a director at the publishers association .
" publishers like big books .
they sell well and give you muscle at the book shops in the battle for window space and other things . "
steady growth the industry itself grows by only a few percentage points each year .
the book industry supports steady growth according to whitaker booktrack , £ 628.5m was made from the uk general book market - excluding sales on the internet , in the airport and at university shops - in the year to 6 october .
this is only about £ 10m more than was made in the same period last year .
despite slow growth , the book market is managing to squeeze a little more value out of the books it sells , without increasing the volume sold .
since 1999 , about 88 million books have been consistently sold each year while profits crept up .
impact of us attacks in the uk , the market has also responded robustly to the attacks on new york last month .
in the week of the attacks the amount of books sold shot up to 182,078 from 93,757 the previous week , says whitaker .

whitaker 's richard knight says nostradamus - whose cryptic 16th century poetry is claimed to contain information about the future - became an overnight success .
at the end of august , two copies of his work were sold a week , a figure that increased to as much as 477 a week at the end of september , according to whitaker data .
upstarts over recent years the book market has got increasingly competitive with the arrival of new upstarts , such as supermarkets and internet retailers .
tim godfray , chief executive of the booksellers association , says " price competition between different types of booksellers " is one of the key challenges facing the industry .
during the late 1990s , supermarkets started stocking books , choosing to sell a large number of a few bestsellers .
as part of their strategy , the supermarkets knock between 33-50 % off the sale price as a result of mass deals negotiated with publishers .
such competition has particularly incensed the small independent booksellers who have been unable to purchase books even from wholesalers at the price that supermarkets are charging .
" some independent booksellers are even resorting to buying their stock from the supermarkets , " says mr godfray .
dot.com rivals internet retailers are viewed with less animosity by traditional booksellers following the dot.com crash , but are still a force to be reckoned with .
stephen king pulled his second ebook amazon , which claims it is on track to profitability , has been increasing its reach through a number of strategic deals , including partnerships with borders and waterstone 's .
there are also moves in the industry to embrace electronic books .
however , stephen king 's high-profile experiment with ebooks was shelved after not enough people paid to download his second online novel , the plant .
e-reading ?
until recently , technology research firm idc was extremely bullish about electronic publishing and predicted that the us market for digital books would grow from $ 9m in 2000 to $ 414m in 2004 .
it has n't really taken off here .
i find my eyes get tired very easily when i am using a reader tim godfray booksellers association the company is now revising its forecast downwards .
but idc believes that reduced publishing costs and the ability to download several novels onto a handheld " reader " will drive demand .
however , the booksellers association 's mr godfray says that ebooks have not yet had a significant impact on the uk industry .
" it has n't really taken off here .
i find my eyes get tired very easily when i am using a reader .
" i use them on the train and if the light changes when the train turns a corner , it 's difficult to read . "
good morale despite increasing competition , mr taylor from the publishers association believes morale in the industry is fairly high .
" most publishers are fed up of hearing about harry potter , but it has -lsb- nonetheless -rsb- been the retail sensation of the last few years , " he says .
" not a video or a computer game , but a book .
that cheers everyone up . "
harry potter and other bestsellers certainly prove that the great british public is far from growing tired of the printed book .
and despite the recent shocks to consumer confidence , the industry is also feeling upbeat about the upcoming christmas season .

senior researchers at the company said the growing complexity of computers and networks demands that the technology does a better job of maintaining and healing itself .
the researchers warn that without these efforts there is a danger that networks will soon become unmanageable .
the company is backing its initiative with its own research program , a series of grants to universities and efforts to make other computer companies sign up .
grand challenge this week ibm is sending 75,000 copies of a manifesto written by paul horn , senior vice president of ibm research , that details the aims of its autonomic computing initiative .
mr horn warns that humans are losing the battle to manage the increasing complexity of computer systems and networks .
this complexity is only going to increase as computer technology shrinks and finds its way into ever more devices .
if the current rates of the expansion of digital technology are maintained , soon there would not be enough people to keep the world 's computer systems running , he said .
he called finding ways of handling this complexity the next " grand challenge " facing the technology industry .
in the manifesto he said : " the growing complexity of the -lsb- technology -rsb- infrastructure threatens to undermine the very benefits information technology aims to provide . "
ideally future networks should resemble the autonomic nervous system which maintains and monitors many basic bodily functions without conscious help .
global power the autonomic nervous system maintains blood sugar and oxygen levels and monitors temperature .
it adjusts the body 's heating and cooling systems to keep body temperature hovering around 37c .
what is needed , argued mr horn , are computer systems that do a much better job of configuring themselves , can work around disruptions , heal any damage they suffer or fight off potential problems .
ibm is planning its own research programs to create technologies that can turn relatively dumb networks into smarter alternatives .
it is also planning to spend millions over the next five years funding 50 research projects at universities to take on the complex challenge .
the likely outcome of the project is a series of software standards that define how to build software or hardware that has these more biological properties .
ibm is working closely with the global grid forum .
this industry body is driving efforts to turn the disparate computing and research capabilities of the world 's science labs into a shared pool of resources that anyone can plug into .
this effort is already driving the creation of software that hides the individual quirks of individual machines and instruments behind common interfaces .

the dispute was sparked by faulty ticket machines in a city underground station , according to operator strathclyde passenger transport -lrb- spt -rrb- .
the company said the closure delayed thousands of football fans on their way to ibrox for rangers ' uefa cup match against dynamo moscow .
this was not a union strike but an unofficial wildcat action by station staff , not drivers spt spokesman the 1945 bst kick-off was put back 15 minutes because of the unofficial action .
maintenance staff working in the station walked out over a disciplinary matter leaving the ticket dispensers in a state of disrepair .
a spokesman for the company said : " generally about 10 % of people who go to ibrox would take the underground .
" we regret very much the inconvenience caused by the closure , particularly to those at the rangers match .
this was not a union strike but an unofficial wildcat action by station staff , not drivers .
" a ticket machine broke down and staff had to issue tickets manually for a while .
" then a representative of one of the unions claimed that there was an agreement which said that no-one had to manually dispense tickets for more than two hours . "
last month , three underground stations were closed early to allow staff members to attend a wedding reception for two colleagues .

bbc news online profiles one of the uk 's most famous companies .
mention the words " rolls-royce " to most people and they will immediately think of the famous cars , with their classic design and luxurious fittings .
but the truth is the modern rolls-royce plc company has had no direct involvement with the motor cars for about 30 years .
rolls-royce : history 1884 : henry royce sets up engineering business 1904 : royce builds his first car and meets car dealer charles rolls 1906 : rolls-royce company formed 1907 : ' silver ghost ' car launched 1914 : company designs its first aero engine 1940 : merlin engine powers spitfire and hurricane fighter planes 1971 : goes into receivership and is nationalised ; aerospace and motor car businesses separated 1987 : rolls-royce plc privatised the aerospace and motor car sides of rolls-royce were split in 1971 , and rolls-royce is now one of the world 's leading engine makers for both civil and military aircraft .
its engines are used in both boeing and airbus passenger aircraft , and military planes such as the harrier and tornado are also powered by rolls-royce .
the company also supplies marine power systems for both commercial and naval ships , and makes gas turbines for use in power generation .
civil aerospace while the defence , marine and energy divisions have been relatively unaffected since the 11 september attacks , the civil aerospace business - which accounts for 54 % of turnover - has suffered .
rolls-royce said that sales at its civil aerospace business in 2002 are likely to be down by about a quarter on this year 's performance .
as a result the company is to cut 5,000 jobs from its worldwide workforce of 43,000 - with 3,800 of the posts going in the uk .
if there is any consolation for rolls-royce it is that its rivals in the aero-engine business have also been having problems .
its us competitors general electric and pratt & whitney have both been shedding jobs as the world 's airlines cut back on costs and new orders .
the rolls-royce trent 800 engine powers the boeing 777 one thing that could help protect rolls in the short run is the money it makes from the contracts it has to repair and maintain the engines it has already sold .
this aftercare business is usually more lucrative than selling the actual engines .
rolls-royce has taken an aggressive approach to engine pricing as it looked to increase market share .
but sandy morris , aerospace and defence analyst at abn amro , says it is " pretty clear " that demand for new planes will fall , which is bound to have an impact in the long run on the aftercare business .
overall , mr morris says he has " respect for rolls-royce for its technology and for the market share it has taken from its competitors . "
but he adds " as an investment proposition it has not quite proven itself " .
the battle for market share does not appear to have done its shareholders any favours , with the company 's share price now lower than the 170p level at which it floated in 1987 .
starter motor it is all a far cry from when henry royce set up his own electrical and mechanical business in 1884 .
mr royce built his first car in 1904 , and that year also met charles rolls , a car dealer .
the two struck up a deal whereby royce made a range of cars to be sold exclusively through rolls ' showroom .
the cars were labelled ' rolls-royce ' - and so a legend was born .
in 1906 the rolls-royce company was formed and the silver ghost model was launched , soon to be described as " the best car in the world " .
taking flight at the outbreak of world war one , royce laid down the foundations of the modern company when he designed his first aero-engine .
the harrier jump-jet is powered by rolls-royce engines engine development continued during the 20s and 30s , and when word war two broke out the rolls-royce merlin engine powered the spitfire and hurricane fighter planes .
in the post-war period the uk aeroengine industry gradually consolidated through a series of mergers until in 1966 rolls-royce became the uk 's main player after it merged with its only domestic rival bristol siddeley .
back down to earth in the 1960s it also began developing its rb211 engine , but spiralling costs in this project brought the company to its knees .
despite cash injections from the conservative government of edward heath the company went into receivership in february 1971 , and was eventually nationalised in 1987 rolls-royce was floated again as part of the thatcher government 's privatisation programme .
what about the cars ?
after being split off from the aero-engine business in 1971 , rolls-royce and bentley motor cars continued as an independent company until it was taken over by the defence and engineering group vickers in 1980 .
rolls-royce motor cars : now in german hands it stayed under vickers ' ownership until 1998 , when it was sold to the german car maker volkswagen .
but volkswagen 's rival bmw holds the rights to the name and the marque , having bought the rights for £ 40m from rolls-royce plc in the same year .
bmw is now set to manufacturing rolls-royce cars in 2003 , leaving volkswagen with the sister bentley brand at the original factory in crewe .

the decision , announced on thursday , will please some mps who believed her investigations could be over-zealous , although ms filkin can reapply for the post in an open contest .
i think she has been an outstanding public servant and has done a magnificent job and she should have been offered a second term independent former mp martin bell other politicians have already criticised the move , and former independent mp martin bell said he was " deeply disappointed " .
and labour mp david winnick said it sent out the message that there was resistance in parliament to having an effective watchdog .
ms filkin 's highest profile inquiry was into former europe minister keith vaz , which dogged labour in the run up to the june general election campaign .
liberal democrat mp archy kirkwood , representing the house of commons commission , said an open contest will be held in february to appoint a new parliamentary standards commissioner .
ms filkin could re-apply for the post , he said , in which case she would be added to the short list .
the decisions comes after former commons speaker betty boothroyd attacked ms filkin in her newly published memoirs .
ms boothroyd suggested the commissioner had become too close to the media , while mps were " put in the dock " on the basis of unsubstantiated accusations against them .
" to the media , she was headline news ; to many mps she had become a witch-hunter , " said the former speaker .
ms boothroyd said ms filkin was painstaking and fair but added : " i felt the house would be better served by somebody who knew it well , working quietly in the background . "
move criticised but senior tory mp and former minister peter bottomley , who sits on the commons standards and privileges committee that oversees ms filkin 's work , condemned the decision .
" i think it is a failure of process , it 's a failure of judgement , it 's a failure of fairness , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme on friday .
mr bottomley praised the job done by ms filkin and said she should have been re-appointed automatically .
labour politicians had been unhappy when some members of their party had faced similar investigations to those conducted on conservative mps in the past , he suggested .
' defence league ' another possible reason for disquiet about ms filkin 's performance was that there was a " defence league " that could not bear independent regulation of their actions , argued mr bottomley .
mr bell - who as mp for tatton in the last parliament served on the standards and privileges committee - said : " i am deeply disappointed . "
" i think it sends a very dispiriting signal about parliament 's willingness to police itself thoroughly .
" i think a lot of senior mps were not happy with her thoroughness but that is the whole point of having an independent commissioner . "
mr winnick said he was " very disappointed indeed " at the decision .
" the message that will come across , intended or otherwise , is that there is a majority in parliament across all parties who do n't want to have someone as a watchdog who is very effective and moreover who looks into cases regardless of -lrb- an mp 's -rrb- seniority , " he said .

the recall by baxter international came as two kidney patients died suddenly in the us state of texas during a dialysis session using blood-cleaning filters produced by the company .
there is no information linking these deaths to the dialyzer made by baxter tanya tyska , baxter spokeswoman twenty-one patients in croatia died earlier this month either during or immediately after their dialysis sessions , while in spain at least 12 similar deaths have been reported .
the us food and drug administration , which oversees the manufacture and distribution of medical products , is investigating the deaths in texas .
meanwhile , baxter has sent a team of medical investigators to texas , spain and croatia , and says it has invited an independent body to audit its manufacturing facilities in sweden .
the equipment is not used in the uk .
" precaution " baxter nonetheless maintains that there is no evidence to suggest that its equipment is responsible for the spate of deaths , and has described accusations as " premature " .
" there is no information linking these deaths to the dialyzer made by baxter , " spokeswoman tanya tyska told the ap news agency .
" we 've instituted the recall as a precaution until an investigation into all aspects of their treatment is completed , " she said , adding that the filters are only one element of the blood-cleaning process .
the spanish government has been carrying out its own tests into the deaths , while croatian authorities have declared that the initial findings point clearly to baxter 's filters .
health minister ana stavljenic-rukavina says the death rate among the country 's kidney patients has returned to normal levels since the baxter dialyzers were replaced with other brands .
her ministry has come under fire for the delay in warning hospitals of possible dangers .
there was a four day lapse between the first deaths in croatia and all of the country 's hospitals being alerted to the threat .
zagreb has now announced plans to pay compensation to the families of those who died .

ifo report the business index is based on a survey of more than 7,000 businesses ' views on current and future business conditions and is considered a reliable indicator of german economic growth .
the much-watched ifo business climate index dropped to 85 in september , down from 89.8 in august , well below analysts ' predictions .
" the numbers were a lot worse than anyone expected , " said sonja hellemann , a currency expert with dresdner kleinwort wasserstein in london .
friday 's report was the institute 's first based entirely on data collected since the 11 september attacks .
attack reaction gernot nerb , the ifo economist in charge of the business survey , said the sharp drop in september might have been an overreaction to attacks on us cities , and could stabilise next month .
" you can never exclude that the index will stabilise , but i would certainly not expect a continuation of this -lsb- negative -rsb- trend next month , " he told reuters .
the data is expected to add to pressure on the european central bank to cut interest rates further to prop-up the eurozone economy .
the euro made no gains this week against the dollar despite difficulties in the us including poor economic news and the anthrax alert which shut down congress .
german outlook meanwhile , germany 's " five wise men " , a panel of economic advisors to the government , said they expected the country 's economy to grow by next year of no more than 1 % , lower than the official estimate , the berliner zeitung newspaper reported on friday .
the statement followed a warning on thursday by finance minister hans eichel that domestic growth could fall to 0.75 % this year , hitting 1.5 % in 2002 .
the government 's official forecast for economic growth is 2.0 % .
the " wise men " are due to unveil their new forecasts in an autumn report released in mid-november , berliner zeitung said , quoting unnamed sources .
germany 's six leading economic institutes have also cut their domestic growth forecast to 0.7-0.8 % , compared with a previous estimate of 2.1 % , the financial times deutschland reported .
the forecasts could be revised again before publication on tuesday , the newspaper added .
