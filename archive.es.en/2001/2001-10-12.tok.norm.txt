north korea 's state-run media said its decision was based on what it termed the tense atmosphere in south korea following last month 's attacks on the united states .

south korea 's red cross called for a speedy resolution to the problem .

bbc news -pipe- scotland -pipe- heart attacks ' kill outside hospital ' categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : scotland front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 12 october , 2001 , 05:22 gmt 06:22 uk heart attacks ' kill outside hospital ' exercise can ward off heart disease over two thirds of deaths from heart attacks in scotland occur outside hospital , a new report has found .
the survey , published in the medical journal the lancet , says almost half of all deaths from heart attack are sudden - within an hour of the attack .
around 70 % of deaths occur outside hospital without any admission , says the research .
the study also found that hospital patients face social , age , and sex inequalities .
this research highlights the fact that more than a third of people who had a heart attack died suddenly , and before they had a chance of being treated in hospital .
professor sir charles george , medical director of the british heart foundation it looked at cases of acute myocardial infarction -lrb- mi -rrb- , or heart attack , in scotland between 1986 and 1995 .
it found that 83,365 people died from mi out of hospital and without previous hospital admission .
the study also found that 117,749 were admitted with a first acute mi , of whom 37,020 died within a year .
deaths outside hospital accounted for 69 % of all deaths from heart attack .
the risk of sudden , out-of-hospital deaths was shown to increase with age .
in 1995 , just 40 % of elderly people survived to reach hospital , compared with 80 % of men and women younger than 55 .
the research also found death rates were substantially higher in deprived socioeconomic groups than in affluent groups , especially in people younger than 65 years .
coronary heart disease deaths from coronary heart disease have halved in most developed countries in the past three decades , and much credit for this fall has been given to modern cardiological treatments .
however , the report claims that two-thirds of this fall can be attributed to better prevention measures , such as improved diet and exercise , and a reduction in smoking .
most previous reports have concentrated on hospital admissions , failing to address the serious problem of sudden deaths .
professor sir charles george , medical director of the british heart foundation , who funded the research project , said : " we have known for some time that scotland has the highest rate of coronary heart disease -lrb- chd -rrb- in the uk .
healthier eating " but these findings reinforce the fact that it is predominantly people in lower-socio economic groups who are most at risk of dying from a heart attack and need most help in learning how to prevent chd .
" it appears that health messages are getting through to more affluent and better educated people .
" a decrease in smoking and healthier eating habits has resulted in a steady decline in death rates in scotland over the past decade - but this is not mirrored in people living in disadvantaged areas .
" this research highlights the fact that more than a third of people who had a heart attack died suddenly , and before they had a chance of being treated in hospital .
" the most important message , therefore , remains the same : prevention is better than cure .
" people 's best chance of beating heart disease - whether rich or poor - is to learn how to take charge of their heart health from an early age . "

a rally on thursday took us shares close to - or in some cases above - their levels of 10 september , before the suicide attacks on new york and washington .
the dow jones industrial average has now recovered 85 % of the 1,369 points it lost in the past four weeks , while the nasdaq composite and standard & poor 's 500 indexes finished just above their pre-attack levels .

uncertainty but there were mixed feelings about whether the rally would be sustained .
charles g crane , a strategist at victory sbf capital management , said : " the fact that a company like ge was able to meet toned-down expectations is again the lack of a negative being a positive for the market .
" the sense i have is that we could retest the september lows before the end of the year or we could do it within next four or five trading sessions .
" we really do n't know . "

the package of measures , unveiled by deputy prime minister lee hsien loong , focuses on heavy tax cuts with the aim of stimulating domestic demand and encouraging business activity .
the government now predicts the economy to shrink by 3 % this year - its worst performance since 1964 - as the global slowdown has been exacerbated by the us attacks .
but not everyone is convinced that this package of measures will do the trick , since export-dependent singapore is heavily exposed to external forces beyond the government 's control .
singapore 's annual exports are worth three times its annual gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , making it one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world .
generous hand-outs the latest stimulus package dwarfs the s $ 2.2bn -lrb- £ 840m ; $ 1.2bn -rrb- measures announced in july , and at s $ 11.3 approaches in scale a mammoth programme announced in 1998 , after the asian economic crisis broke .
singapore is heavily reliant on trade the current programme is worth 7 % of gdp , mr lee said , and would push the state budget temporarily into the red .
the main focus of the plan is a drastic programme of tax cuts , including rebates on personal and corporate taxes , and a range of incentives for business .
mr lee also announced an expansion of the " singapore share " scheme , under which citizens are urged to buy quasi-government-bonds as a means of encouraging saving and investment .
in addition , the package included curbs on speculation in property , effectively banning the sale of residential and commercial land sites for the whole of next year .
a property bubble was one of the main factors behind the asian economic crisis of 1997-98 .
faint praise analysts have broadly welcomed the package , saying it should help trim the worst of the economic falls in the fourth quarter of the year .
" the timing is good when the economy is right at its weakest point , " said paul schymyck , an economist at ideaglobal.com.
but some took issue with the property measures .
" in a way , it 's long overdue , " said rajeev malik , economist at jp morgan .
" who 's going to speculate on property at this point ? "
and others pointed out that while domestic demand may well be stimulated , that will not do much to help the wider economy , which is at the mercy of global demand , especially for hi-tech goods .

sir peter bonfield , whose contract ends in december 2002 , is poised to retire early after the completion of the telecoms giant 's initial revival plan , insiders told the financial times newspaper .

it had seemed likely that bt would follow up the spin-off of its mobile phone unit , now called mm02 , with a more fundamental break-up .

lawyers for the international television news channel cnn spent most of thursday arguing cameras should be allowed in as a matter of public interest .
dame janet smith is now expected to announce her decision during the week beginning 15 october , when the hearing reopens .
the us broadcaster wants to televise the inquiry into the former gp , serving 15 life sentences for killing patients with diamorphine injections .
public interest chairman dame janet smith said witnesses could find it too stressful to give evidence in front of cameras .
cnn said the inquiry , expected to last two years , is of considerable public interest and raises many important issues .
it also argued that its filming could help draw attention to the inquiry and possibly furnish it with further information .
shipman was convicted of 15 murders and one charge of forging a victim 's will on 31 january 2000 .
he is serving a life sentence in frankland prison , county durham .
but there are fears that he has killed many more of his patients , and the inquiry is investigating the deaths of at least another 466 .
on thursday dame janet heard submissions from cnn that it had a " presumptive right " to televise the proceedings .
she opened a day-long hearing by telling the inquiry that she had allowed thursday 's proceedings to be filmed as part of a " pilot " or " experiment " to see how it would be operated in future .
she said she would see the transcript on friday and would then be able to make her decision .
vulnerable witnesses when she opened the inquiry last may , dame janet argued that vulnerable witnesses , particularly those who fear their relatives were murdered by shipman , should be protected from the cameras .
ann alexander , a solicitor representing thameside families support group , said in a statement it was evident from the families that they were opposed to the broadcasting of witness statements .
but dame janet admitted that for other elements of the inquiry the arguments were more finely balanced .
the inquiries into the murder of victoria climbie and the southall rail disasters have both been filmed .
the bbc made a similar application to film the inquiry in june this year .
but dame janet said thursday 's application was " a fresh matter altogether " .

jal had previously forecast that it would earn 43bn yen -lrb- £ 245m ; $ 353m -rrb- in the year to end-march , but has now revised that figure into a 50bn-yen loss .
the firm said it would be cutting 600 jobs , over and above 700 lay-offs announced earlier in the year .
at the same time , it slashed its dividend to shareholders from 3 yen per share to zero .
in hope of defraying some of the costs of higher insurance charges , jal plans to raise fares on domestic flights by 500 yen , and on international flights by $ 5 .
jal has been hit hard by increased insurance costs , and suffers worse than japan 's other airlines , because it is the main international carrier .
calls for aid jal has already reduced its us-bound schedules by almost one-quarter as a result of last month 's attacks .
japan 's other major carriers , all nippon airways and japan air system , have not yet said whether they will pass on some of the burden to passengers .
as elsewhere , there has been a mounting campaign for government help for the airline industry .

jal had previously forecast that it would earn 43bn yen -lrb- £ 245m ; $ 353m -rrb- in the year to end-march , but has now revised that figure into a 50bn-yen loss .
the firm said it would be cutting 600 jobs , over and above 700 lay-offs announced earlier in the year .
at the same time , it slashed its dividend to shareholders from 3 yen per share to zero .
in hope of defraying some of the costs of higher insurance charges , jal plans to raise fares on domestic flights by 500 yen , and on international flights by $ 5 .
jal has been hit hard by increased insurance costs , and suffers worse than japan 's other airlines , because it is the main international carrier .
calls for aid jal has already reduced its us-bound schedules by almost one-quarter as a result of last month 's attacks .
japan 's other major carriers , all nippon airways and japan air system , have not yet said whether they will pass on some of the burden to passengers .
as elsewhere , there has been a mounting campaign for government help for the airline industry .
the japanese government has stepped in to guarantee third-party insurance up to $ 2bn to cover any shortfall in claims for six months .
but it is still considering whether the airline industry merits any more direct financial aid .

these airlines , known as no-frills or discount airlines , are seizing the initiative while most other carriers are losing their heads .
they were designed from the start to be low cost gerald khoo bnp paribas their advantage is a low-cost ethos that is enabling them to ride out the economic slowdown and the fall-out from the attacks on the us last month .
and in a corporate culture where cost-cutting has become a watchword , budget airlines are ahead of the game .
" they were designed from the start to be low cost , " said gerald khoo , an airline analyst at bnp paribas .
quick turnaround the low-cost strategy centres on limited turnaround times at airports - usually 20 to 25 minutes on the tarmac , said andy chu , an airline analyst at merrill lynch .
this means the airlines can squeeze more flights out of a day - eight versus the normal six .
" the whole premise is cut costs and build volume , " said david magliano , sales and marketing director at go .
some of the airlines , such as ryanair , also use secondary airports with much lower charges , as well as less congestion , which minimises the chances of delay .
low-cost culture paperless ticketing , and sales over the internet and the phone - rather than through a travel agent that charges commission - also keep costs down .
often the penny-pinching culture permeates the whole organisation , meaning that head offices remain small and that the growth of the company is controlled .
" they are careful not to over expand , " said mr chu .
" ryanair for example has capped its annual growth at 25 % . "
the companies also negotiate aggressive pay deals with staff - and until recently employees usually lacked union representation .
contrasting fortunes so while british airways slashes its workforce , cuts capacity and see its profits fall by 98 % , no-frills easyjet , for example , is adding routes and flights to its schedule .
at the end of october , easyjet said profits rose by 82 % to £ 40m in the year to the end of september .
" while some other airlines are announcing job losses and fleet capacity reductions , we look forward to hiring additional staff to deliver planned growth , " said chief executive ray webster .
similarly , ryanair , europe 's largest low-fare airline , says it is on course to make $ 130m of profit this year .
by contrast , flag carriers such as swissair and sabena are on the verge of collapse after the events of 11 september compounded long-term problems at both companies .
of course it is simplistic to attribute the contrasting fortunes of these airlines to their cost structures .
british airways and the like have suffered considerable loss of revenue from a dramatic drop in demand for transatlantic flights , as well as the temporary closure of us airspace after the attacks .
a level playing field ?
nevertheless , low-cost airlines have griped for years about how international airlines subsidised their loss-making routes in europe with profits from the long-haul flights .
now it seems the airlines are competing on a more level playing field , and the low-cost contenders are keen to press their advantage .
when asked last month if the current crisis was grave for budget airlines , go 's mr magliano replied : " it 's an opportunity .
' grave ' is the last word i would use . "
ryanair 's chief executive michael o 'leary was also full of fighting talk .
" ryanair has responded quickly to the recent crisis by lowering air fares and trying to keep the market moving , keep the seats full and the staff employed - basically fly our way out of this problem , " he said last month .
strong marketing within days of each other last month , many of the low-cost airlines launched strong marketing campaigns to win back passengers with ludicrously low prices .
ryanair , for example , is advertising one-way tickets to at least nine destinations for under £ 10 .
naturally , not all seats on the flights are so low .
but once the fixed flight costs are covered , the airlines are canny enough to generate good publicity with a few cheap seats .
" as the other airlines have faded , they can see their opportunity , the gap in the market , " said mr khoo from bnp paribas .
some analysts even conjecture that the budget airlines are deliberately putting the squeeze on their traditional rivals at a time when they are most vulnerable .
as a sign of the times , even stellar investment banks are starting to encourage their staff to abandon business class for easyjet , which services many of the major european airports .
industry risks however , the low-cost airlines are not immune from the usual risks in the industry , such as fuel costs , volatile earnings and increases in airport charges .
also , the airline industry is in a state of flux , and if merger regulations are relaxed , there could be new airline giants around the corner to challenge the budget upstarts .
ba has already revived its attempts to merge with dutch carrier klm .
the no-frills airlines may be genetically engineered to keep costs down , but they do n't yet have the clout to take over the european skies .

dr george venters , a consultant in public health medicine in lanarkshire , scotland , claims evidence linking the two conditions is weak .
the variant form of cjd may simply be a rare type , which existed long before the bse epidemic in cows , but was simply not diagnosed and catalogued properly until the 1990s .
if his theory is correct , it would mean victims of the condition did not get it by eating infected meat .
i believe the evidence now available casts serious doubts on the case for a causal link dr george venters but other cjd experts say the evidence is strong enough to firmly suggest humans contract vcjd by eating meat from cattle with bse containing infectious prion proteins .
dr venters bases his opinion on the fact that the rate of growth in the number of confirmed cases is much less than might be expected from a food-borne source .
he suggests the rate of growth in the number of vcjd cases is more consistent with a previously misdiagnosed but extremely rare disease being found .
advances in the detection and reporting of suspected cases through the cjd surveillance unit in edinburgh could account for an apparent rise in the number of cases , none of which would have been officially recorded previously .
he wants a public debate on the evidence supporting a link between the two diseases .
speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , dr venters said government policy should focus on " a more realistic appraisal of risk , addressing what is likely to happen rather than what is a frightening but increasingly less likely possibility " .
he said : " without doubt , general anxiety about so dreadful a possibility as bse causing a similar disease in humans resulted in many workers involved with bse and cjd having to reach precipitate conclusions in which public safety was rightly the prime consideration .
" i believe the evidence now available casts serious doubts on the case for a causal link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and ' new ' variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease .
" a particular problem is that when you have a food-born infection you expect the rate at which cases occur to run parallel to the rate at which the population is exposed to infection .
that does n't seem to be happening . "
public debate vcjd cases do n't occur in those countries that have not got bse dr phillip monk but dr phillip monk , a consultant in communicable diseases who investigated a vcjd cluster in queniborough , leicester , dismissed the theory .
he told today : " you only have to realise that vcjd occurs in countries like ours that have had high problems with bse . " vcjd cases do n't occur in those countries that have not got bse .
the moment we relax our guard , we put people at risk again . "
professor james ironside , from the cjd surveillance unit , also disagreed with dr venters ' theory .
he said : " i think it is an interesting paper and it is always important to consider a range of arguments on this subject because there are huge numbers of uncertainties .
" but we do know from a number of studies done both here and in the states that the transmissible agent that causes bse is the same as that which causes cjd and has also transmitted to other species including cats , wild cats and antelope in zoos .
" the most probable hypotheses for linking the numbers of species together is by food-borne exposure as was the case with bse . "
professor ironside added that the incubation period of the disease was significant and there had been a slight rise in the number of cases over the past 12 months .
professor peter smith , chairman of seac , the scientific body that advises the government on cjd , said the only way to prove the link between bse and cjd would be to inject bse-infected material directly into a human .
but he said : " the circumstantial evidence is beyond reasonable doubt now that bse and vcjd are caused by the same infectious agent . "

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- doubt cast on bse-cjd link categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 12 october , 2001 , 07:35 gmt 08:35 uk doubt cast on bse-cjd link the brain of a cjd patient the link between " mad cow disease " and vcjd - commonly thought to be its human equivalent - has been disputed by an expert .
dr george venters , a consultant in public health medicine in lanarkshire , scotland , claims evidence linking the two conditions is weak .
the variant form of cjd may simply be a rare type , which existed long before the bse epidemic in cows , but was simply not diagnosed and catalogued properly until the 1990s .
if his theory is correct , it would mean victims of the condition did not get it by eating infected meat .
i believe the evidence now available casts serious doubts on the case for a causal link dr george venters but other cjd experts say the evidence is strong enough to firmly suggest humans contract vcjd by eating meat from cattle with bse containing infectious prion proteins .
dr venters bases his opinion on the fact that the rate of growth in the number of confirmed cases is much less than might be expected from a food-borne source .
he suggests the rate of growth in the number of vcjd cases is more consistent with a previously misdiagnosed but extremely rare disease being found .
advances in the detection and reporting of suspected cases through the cjd surveillance unit in edinburgh could account for an apparent rise in the number of cases , none of which would have been officially recorded previously .
he wants a public debate on the evidence supporting a link between the two diseases .
dr george venters put forward the controversial theory speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , dr venters said government policy should focus on " a more realistic appraisal of risk , addressing what is likely to happen rather than what is a frightening but increasingly less likely possibility " .
he said : " without doubt , general anxiety about so dreadful a possibility as bse causing a similar disease in humans resulted in many workers involved with bse and cjd having to reach precipitate conclusions in which public safety was rightly the prime consideration .
" i believe the evidence now available casts serious doubts on the case for a causal link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and ' new ' variant creutzfeldt-jakob disease .
" a particular problem is that when you have a food-born infection you expect the rate at which cases occur to run parallel to the rate at which the population is exposed to infection .
that does n't seem to be happening . "

he told today : " you only have to realise that vcjd occurs in countries like ours that have had high problems with bse . " vcjd cases do n't occur in those countries that have not got bse .

in an effort to cut costs , the firm said it was cutting 600 jobs over and above a previous cull of 2,900 staff completed earlier in the year .
the firm declined to make any forecasts for this year and next , arguing that it was not yet clear when underlying market conditions would improve .
" the shock caused by the september 11 attacks - which cost the group significant losses in revenue and bookings - has pushed back by at least one or two quarters the hope of a recovery in growth , " the company said .
shares in cap gemini , which have already lost some two-thirds of their value this year , fell by almost 8 % in early trading in paris before recovering slightly .
profits ease although it has not released detailed earnings targets for the third quarter , cap gemini has said it expects full-year sales of 9bn euros -lrb- £ 5.6bn ; $ 8.1bn -rrb- , lowered from a previous target of 9.6bn euros .
but even in the first half of the year , when the firm made a profit of 111m euros , its operating margin dropped from 8.5 % to 6.1 % .
cap gemini said its cost-cutting measures would " enable the group to weather the storm better should a recession in europe be confirmed and rapidly take advantage of the recovery when it happens " .
of the 600 new job cuts , 400 will be made in the us , and the remaining 200 in germany .

yukos and kvaerner 's largest shareholder , norwegian oil and gas services group aker maritime - which holds a 18 % stake - may soon be carving up kvaerner , local press reported .
aker is interested in kvaerner 's oil and gas interests the company , which employs 35,000 and is desperately fighting off bankruptcy , services yukos ' yuganskneftegas oil exploration division .

kvaerner may be split under a deal in which aker buys kvaerner 's oil and gas division and yukos takes engineering and construction , the norwegian newspaper aftenposten reported .

over the past months , the company 's chief executive has resigned , its shares were suspended on oslo 's stock exchange , and its credit rating downgraded .

neither aker nor kvaerner would comment on the unsourced report .
yukos said on thursday that its unit yukos finance had bought shares in kvaerner , pushing its above the 10 % limit at which , under norwegian law , companies have to declare their stake .

lord saville of newdigate is heading the bloody sunday inquiry , which is examining the events of 30 january 1972 .
thirteen catholic men were shot dead by british soldiers during a civil rights march in londonderry that day .
a 14th person died later .
witnesses have been giving evidence to the hearing about what they saw that day .
the inquiry now has a document which refers to activities in and around glenfada park in the city where four people were killed and five people were wounded .
fatal witness x is asking the inquiry if he can give his evidence anonymously and from behind a screen .
the inquiry has been sitting in public in derry since march 2000 .
about 250 military witnesses are to be called into the witness box at the multi-million pound inquiry , early next year .
among them will be the paratroopers who fired the fatal shots .
last year the court of appeal in london ruled that anonymity would be granted to 17 of the soldiers who had taken the action to protect their identities .

gone with the wind author margaret mitchell 's estate complained that the parody written by alice randall , breached the original 's copyright .
randall 's book may not be published in the uk the 11th circuit court of appeals in atlanta on wednesday said that the parody - the wind done gone - is protected by the first amendment .
this amendment to the us constitution guarantees freedom of worship , speech , assembly and a free press .
monetary damages a lawyer for the publisher of randall 's book - houghton mifflin co - said the ruling is a " complete vindication " of their case .
" parody , of course , is permissible under the copyright laws , " he said but the three-judge panel ruled that mitchell 's estate may be entitled to monetary damages .
the wind done gone , re-tells mitchell 's civil war-era story from a slave 's point of view .
randall 's book has many references to the original randall 's story is narrated by a mixed-race plantation owner 's daughter who is gone with the wind heroine scarlett o 'hara 's half-sister .
the author has said her work was designed to ridicule a book that portrayed black slaves as happy and supportive of white masters in the racist confederate south .
but mitchell 's estate argued that the use of the same settings and characters amounted to a breach of the original work 's copyright .
the court has now sent the case back to a lower court , which may now consider whether mitchell 's heirs are entitled to monetary damages .
richard kurnit , a new york-based lawyer for mitchell 's heirs , said the latest ruling raised the question of whether the now-published parody affected sequel rights to gone with the wind .
a spokesperson for houghton mifflin in the uk said it would be at least several months before the book is released in the uk , if at all .

hardly any party in burundi appears to be in a hurry for a settlement nelson mandela but the former south african president , who was speaking after a day of talks in pretoria , said burundi 's political parties had agreed on the composition of a transitional government , which is due to be installed in the capital bujumbura at the beginning of next month .
he accused the government and rebels of bringing gloom to the negotiations , which he characterised as " alarmingly slow , painful and costly " .
two rival hutu rebel groups took part in the talks for the first time in years , but mr mandela said there was no agreement on a ceasefire .
leaders from rwanda , burundi , tanzania , kenya and the democratic republic of congo also attended the talks .
burundian president pierre buyoya , a tutsi , will lead the transitional government for the first 18 months , with a hutu vice-president .
the roles will be reversed for the second half of the three-year government .
but our correspondent in the great lakes says it is doubtful whether a transitional government can be viable without a ceasefire .
the summit also failed to agree on the size and composition of the special protection unit to ensure the safety of hutu politicians returning from exile .
without such a unit in place , many are not keen to return home .
troubled history since the war started in 1993 some 200,000 people have died .
a further 300,000 burundians are in refugee camps in tanzania .
burundi is a former belgian trust territory with a population of six million .
since independence in 1961 it has held only one multi-party election .
that election brought in the first hutu head of state , melchior ndadaye , and a parliament dominated by the mainly hutu frodebu party .
but within months , ndadaye was assassinated by paratroopers , and the scene was set for years of often violent confrontation between the hutu and tutsi political classes .
many members of the tutsi elite , particularly in the armed forces , feared they would be swamped by full-scale democracy .
some felt that only a power-sharing agreement with hutus could protect them , while others simply did not want to surrender power .
many hutu politicians felt cheated because they had won the elections and their ethnic group represented an estimated 85 % of the population .
