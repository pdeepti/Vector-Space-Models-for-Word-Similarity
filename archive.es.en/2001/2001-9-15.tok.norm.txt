islanders have refused to let the asylum seekers be housed on their land .
local landowners are demanding extra compensation it means the australians are now having to construct temporary shelters for all the boat people on a hot and exposed piece of wasteland which has no ready-built facilities .
the asylum seekers fled afghanistan and its taleban regime hoping the developed world would give them a welcome and a better life .
first the australian government sent sas soldiers to prevent them from landing on its territory , and now there is worse to come .
wasteland australian military engineers are busy constructing a camp for the afghans on a desolate spot in the centre of the island of nauru .
in every direction is a barren lifeless vista of bare limestone rock , all vegetation gone , the result of years of over-mining .
the original plan was to house most of the boat people in air-conditioned bungalows by nauru 's seashore , but that is now impossible .
local landowners are demanding extra compensation .
many nauruans do not see why their island , the world 's smallest republic , should have to shoulder australia 's burden .
instead the afghans , who are due to arrive on monday , will have to live in the stifling heat of the island 's interior in baking temperatures under corrugated iron roofs .
the site does not even have water , electricity or sanitation .

" you do n't feel like laughing but you laugh . "

st hugh 's college , where " the anatomy of laughter " conference is being held on saturday and sunday , said it had unprecedented support for the event .
the international event explores the reasons why people laugh even in the face of adversity .
edith mcmorran , co-founder of the academic group which has organised the convention , said : " at times everything is too much and then there is almost a need for a release of tension .
' belly laughs ' " laughter is the other side of tears .
one minute you feel like crying and then something strange happens in front of you , or someone cracks a joke .
" you do n't feel like laughing but you laugh . "
the conference is being held to mark the 10th anniversary of the university-based translation research in oxford group -lrb- trio -rrb- .
it provides an international forum for professional translators , academics and creative writers to meet and explore the theory and practice of literary translation .
subjects covered in sessions at the laughter conference include " ' belly laughs " and " is god laughing ? " .

but i do n't feel frightened , because this is not a war in any sense that i have ever known .
this is war without the warfare .
a battle without an army .
death without an occupying force .
the missile was one of america 's own civilian planes , turned against herself .
passengers were hurled at stockbrokers and military clerks working at their desks .
how could mr bush 's missile shield have stopped that ?
as george bush says , this is the first war of the 21st century .
no border has been transgressed .
no enemy troops swarm in the streets .
instead , this city of my home for the last four years looks just the same - a mosaic of green trees and cool white marble .
everything is standing .
except , that is , part of the pentagon - the world 's safest office block , which is now in ruins .
brave new world how ill-equipped i feel i am to deal with this new world .
it feels like a scene from that strange russian novel , the master and margarita , when the devil visits the earth , turning one part of life utterly upside down .
everything else he leaves intact , cunningly loosening the ties which bind us to normality .
i stand watching the president 's spotless helicopter fly out of the golden blue sky of the west , and land on the lawn of the white house just in front of me .
everything looks normal .
america is now at war with terrorism .
and this is what will define mr bush .
either it will be his finest hour , or his vietnam but next to me a cameraman is reading today 's washington post , full of yesterday 's news , with headlines about social security and the baseball .

if i was mr bush , i would be worried .
paul wolfowitz , the under-secretary of defence was almost licking his lips at congress 's promise of $ 20bn to fight this war .
and that , said mr wolfowitz , puffing his chest up , is only the down-payment .
the warriors , who have been pacing the corridors of the pentagon like unquiet ghosts ever since the cold war ended , have found their new role .
and , of course , this time it 's personal .
the pentagon itself has been attacked , and the warriors are out for revenge .
but if they thought the viet cong were an elusive enemy , they have n't seen anything yet .
if the terrorists thought they would somehow weaken the american spirit , they are miscalculating as badly as the warriors of the pentagon a successful war needs a beginning , a middle and an end .
but in this war there will be no targets to fix on , no land to occupy and conquer , no enemy to come out at the end waving a white flag .
one of the wiser heads in the pentagon said : " i realise we can not extinguish religious fanaticism with missiles . "
but i 'm afraid that some in the pentagon are now about to try .
american spirit it is easy to find fault with the americans , to laugh at their gaucheness and ignorance of the outside world .
but if the terrorists thought they would somehow weaken the american spirit , that all they needed were a few civilians slaughtered to bring down this corrupt house of capitalism , they are miscalculating as badly as the warriors of the pentagon .
this crisis has not caused americans to descend into doubt and anxiety about themselves , as i suspect the british would .
nor have they rampaged in orgies of xenophobic hatred against arabs .
instead , they have just gone on calmly and cheerfully .
americans are not interested in conquest and feel no need to justify themselves to anyone .
in their response to this crisis , i have seen the resilience and tolerance of this broad society , and the strength and kindness of their innocence .

by bbc world affairs editor john simpson in islamabad after eight o 'clock at night , in the darkness of kabul , the loudest noise is the barking of dogs , and the brightest lights are the faint gold of oil-lamps in the windows of the little houses .
this is a society which has been dragged forcibly backwards in time , in the first place by three decades of constant war and upheaval , and nowadays by the strangest manifestation of political and religious fundamentalism anywhere on earth - the rule of the taleban .
the taleban themselves are n't a terrorist outfit as such .
they show no great interest in the outside world , one way or another that rule has given osama bin laden free rein - and now , as a result of the horrific events in new york , washington and pennsylvania , it 's beginning to look as though the united states may make afghanistan pay a high price for the political anarchy which has made it one of the poorest , most backward countries on earth .
but , contrary to what you hear from western politicians , military analysts and journalists , it 's not true that the taleban and osama bin laden are jointly part of some big international terrorist consortium .
bin laden is the guest of the taleban in afghanistan , and their leader , the reclusive one-eyed mullah omar , approves of him and is his personal friend .
hence the scope bin laden has to pursue his terrorist activities .
distinct organisations the taleban themselves are n't a terrorist outfit as such .
they show no great interest in the outside world , one way or another .
if anything , the news of the terrible attacks in america will have alarmed them .
no doubt plenty of them will have felt that it served the great satan right - but i think we can be pretty sure that their first and overriding reaction was one of anxiety .
what happens to them now ?
what will be the future of their strange political and religious experiment ?
in the west we 've come to assume that islamic fundamentalism is instinctively anti-western .
in fact the taleban owe their existence - born in the refugee camps across the afghan border in pakistan in the 1980s - to a deep-seated hatred of the godless soviet union which had invaded their country .
the west , in as far as the taleban thought about it , was on their side .
pakistan 's secret services helped to build up the taleban as a powerful force , and if anything the americans - who were in close touch with the pakistanis over afghanistan - approved .
even now , at this late stage , i think it is probably true to say that if the united states were prepared to put aside a tenth of the amount which president clinton spent on firing fire cruise missiles at afghanistan three years ago , and devoted it instead to food aid and help for the collapsed infrastructure of afghanistan , that would be enough to win the taleban over .
it 's not going to happen , of course .
instead , the taleban now face the real possibility that they will be blasted out of existence , in order to deal once and for all with osama bin laden .
sweeping away the taleban should certainly get rid of the osama bin laden problem .
but will it get rid of the afghanistan problem ?
bin laden 's great strength up to now has been that the taleban control 90 % of afghanistan and have imposed their own version of law and order on it .
if that law and order collapse , and we get a return to the general lawlessness and banditry of five years ago , then bin laden - who 's already got a price of $ 5m on his head , wo n't last more than a week before some warlord catches him and claims the prize .
taleban regime i do n't mean to present the taleban as some peaceable , bucolic outfit wrapped up in their own religious observances .
the way they have behaved towards women , aid agencies - and not just those which are actively christian - and towards the population in general , is completely unacceptable in western eyes .
the other day i watched the turbaned and robed agents of the ministry for the suppression of vice and the promotion of virtue stride into the intercontinental hotel in kabul .
they 'd come to round up the inoffensive afghan translators who had been working for the few western television organisations allowed into afghanistan to cover the trial of the aid agency people charged with trying to convert people to christianity .
it reminded me of the old kgb , or saddam hussein 's secret police , only in mediaeval dress .
the americans and their allies may well feel now that the time has come to get rid of a virtual state like afghanistan , a black hole on the map where terrorism can take root and proliferate .
but they 'd do well to remember that the basic problem in afghanistan is the lack of firm , accepted , broadly-based government .
sweeping away the taleban , who actually do govern most of the country , should certainly get rid of the osama bin laden problem .
but will it get rid of the afghanistan problem , which brought the taleban to power in the first place , and made it a convenient training ground for bin laden to operate in ?

the marine conservation society -lrb- mcs -rrb- says the environment , fish and seabirds are harmed by seaside visitors leaving garbage behind them .
the annual beachwatch programme is now in its ninth year , and is one of the most extensive in europe .
a mcs spokesman said : " our aim is to raise awareness about the problem of marine and coastal litter .
health harmed " the initiative monitors levels and sources of litter on britain 's beaches , and seeks to encourage action to reduce marine and coastal pollution at source . "
it is not only sewage that threatens marine life the mcs says as well as harming wildlife , litter can also damage human health and property .
last year nearly 1,400 volunteers collected rubbish from 150 beaches around the uk in 2000 litter levels decreased by 7 % , a drop for the second successive year , but it was still the third highest litter density recorded since beachwatch began .
beach visitors are the largest source of rubbish , but the litter also comes from fishing boats , cargo ships and items such as cotton buds flushed down the toilet .
the amount of plastic rubbish has been causing the society concern .
nearly 10,000 small plastic items were found , many of them industrial pellets which fish and seabirds can mistake for food , putting themselves at risk of being poisoned by chemicals attached to the plastic .
among the litter picked up in the last survey were a fridge door , a number 49 lottery ball , and a shampoo sachet dating from before the introduction of decimal coinage 30 years ago .

mr mosey 's daughter helga , 19 , was among the victims when pan am flight 103 was blown up over lockerbie .

he also expressed the sadness felt by the lockerbie support group over the us terror attacks and for the victims ' families .

mr mosey said he wrote ' ' as an individual whose family has been a victim of a terrorist attack " .
tuesday 's attacks in the us brought back memories of 13 years ago to the families of victims and residents of lockerbie .
pamela dix , whose brother peter died in the lockerbie bomb , said : " it 's times like this that those of us who have experienced something of this nature are drawn together . "
