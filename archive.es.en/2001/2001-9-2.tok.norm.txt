speaking in the capital , kinshasa , mr annan said he was encouraged by recent moves to find an end to the three-year congolese war .
he also had positive words to say about talks held just over a week ago by congo 's warring factions and urged them to build on the trust and mutual respect that he said they had shown .
after holding talks with president joseph kabila , mr annan will fly to the disputed city of kisangani on monday and then to the rwandan capital , kigali .
glimmer of hope mr annan is the latest in a long line of high-profile visitors to have come to kinshasa , since the country 's peace process started in earnest earlier in the year .
he might be the most senior so far but he has come with a similar message to the heads of state , government ministers and un officials who preceded him .
but there is at last a glimmer of hope in one of africa 's most desperate countries .
in words that will please the kinshasa government , which has been fighting rwandan and ugandan-backed rebellions for three years , mr annan stressed that national sovereignty must be restored .
none of these things have n't been said before but the three-day visit is being greeted in the dr congo as a welcome gesture of good faith .
talk and tour whilst in the capital , the secretary general will hold talks with president kabila , the political opposition and un peacekeepers monitoring a seven-month old ceasefire .
then he flies to kisangani , a city in the north-east of dr congo which has been fought over for control three times by the once allied , now rival , ugandan and rwandan armies .
for that reason it has become a powerful symbol in congo for the destruction the two rebellions have caused , even more so since the rwandan-backed rebel soldiers who garrison the city refuse to withdraw in spite of un security council resolutions .
this led many congolese people to say that the un is happy to issue statements but not to commit themselves to action .
they also say the world body was late in getting involved in the war and then when it went in it sent too few peacekeepers .
these are all charges kofi annan will no doubt try to answer during his visit .

in an hour-long speech , the president said he intended to honour his elections promises to modernise mexico and root out corruption .
" it is time for social justice to occupy the place it deserves in the national agenda .
it is time to reincorporate those who were left by the wayside , " president fox said .
protests he also said that mexico had " been able to cushion the negative impacts " of the us economic slowdown .
before the speech , peasant farmers and trade unionists gathered outside the congress building to protest at what they see as president fox 's inability to protect the poorest sectors of mexican society .
inside the chamber , mr fox was heckled and booed by opposition politicians .
president fox is head of the national action party -lrb- pan -rrb- .
his victory in last year 's elections meant that the pri was voted out of power for the first time in more than 70 years .
many observers saw this as heralding a period of decisive change in mexico , as the right-wing pan brought in reforms and modernised both state institutions and the economy .
but president fox has found it difficult to bring in reforms , as the pri is still the largest single party in congress , and still governs in many of mexico 's 32 states .

officers were on alert overnight after riot police broke up disturbances near the city 's main railway station and in streets near the main square before the match .
at least eight fans and two police officers were reportedly injured .
national criminal intelligence service -lrb- ncis -rrb- spokesman mark steels said on saturday that 165 fans had been arrested .
more than 100 were german and most of the rest , including nine arrested at the olympic stadium , were english , he said .
a total of 800 german officers were on patrol around munich on saturday .
mr steels said : " they did a very good job under difficult circumstances . "
wet weather and the decision by many city centre bars to shut early on saturday also helped defuse tension .
home secretary david blunkett , who was at the game , said on saturday that co-operation between the german and english police had been " exemplary " .
" the support that we have received from the munich police and both the bavarian and federal interior ministries has been of the highest order , " he said .
" the speed and efficiency that has been shown in dealing with rowdiness and disorder from both german and english supporters has reduced what would otherwise have been a much more threatening situation . "
the support that we have received from the munich police and both the bavarian and federal interior ministries has been of the highest order david blunkett home secretary the home secretary added : " the drunken troublemakers have been taken off the streets , and those found to have been causing disorder from england will now be subject to our new legislation and dealt with accordingly . "
on saturday afternoon , england fans drinking outside a bar near munich 's main railway station hurled bottles at germans .
but police moved in to break up a scuffle which developed , closing off nearby streets .
shortly afterwards police stopped similar stand-offs between english and german fans in the streets around the marienplatz .
hundreds of english fans gathered around the main square ahead of the game .
and in the stadium , several were seated among the german supporters - many of whom walked out after england 's fifth goal and threw seat cushions onto the pitch in frustration .
alcohol was banned in and around the stadium for three hours before and three hours after the match .
british authorities said 21 fans arrested in frankfurt on friday night were expected to be released after the match , with 14 likely to face charges .
well in advance of the match , british police used new powers under the football disorder act , created following violent clashes between english and german fans during euro 2000 in brussels .
a total of 79 people had been processed by police at ports and airports by the start of the match , according to the ncis .
fifty-eight were prevented from travelling to germany - 33 were given bans , nine have bans pending and 16 had their hearings adjourned .
letters were also sent to 537 alleged hooligans ordering them to surrender their passports at police stations before the game .
plainclothes police officers were in germany to help identify offenders and local police imposed similar restrictions on known german troublemakers .
power surge a uk national grid spokeswoman said there had been a surge of around 1,000 megawatts at half-time - equivalent to around 400,000 kettles being boiled - as the referee blew his whistle just seconds after england took a 2-1 lead .
euphoric scenes across britain greeted the final whistle .
around 500 fans gathered in trafalgar square in central london - some dancing in the fountain .

around 4,000 soldiers on exercise in the british army training unit suffield -lrb- batus -rrb- area in alberta , west canada , downed tools for the duration of the match .
troops from regiments across britain huddled around radios in their tanks and armoured vehicles on the vast prairie area to listen to the game .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- more troops to aid disease cull categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 2 september , 2001 , 06:20 gmt 07:20 uk more troops to aid disease cull the exclusion zone has been extended more soldiers are arriving in northumberland to co-ordinate the slaughter and disposal of infected livestock around the latest outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease .
ten two-man teams from the newcastle 's 101 -lrb- northumbrian -rrb- regiment , royal artillery -lrb- volunteers -rrb- are already working with the department for environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- staff , farmers and field vets .
but the teams will need a 72-hour biosecurity break between working on infected premises and disinfecting points .
so on sunday another five teams will be drafted in from durham 's tyne tees regiment , middlesbrough 's 34 signals regiment -lrb- volunteers -rrb- and newcastle 's queen 's own yeomanry .
it is not that we can not cope , it is just that we were beginning to run a little bit faster than we wanted to defra regional operations director john bradbury a defra spokesman said : " they -lsb- the soldiers -rsb- will be making sure that all problems that can arise are dealt with and ensuring contractors follow bio-security procedures . "
defra regional operations director john bradbury described the move as a " prudent measure " .
he added : " it is not that we can not cope , it is just that we were beginning to run a little bit faster than we wanted to .
" i wanted to bring the army in before we were galloping along out of control . "
mr bradbury continued : " epidemiologists say that when you get foot-and-mouth , you get a flood of cases and you get a long tail .
" hopefully the action we are taking will help eradicate the disease - when that will happen , i do not know . "
disease statistics cases so far : 1,994 animals slaughtered : 3,778,000 awaiting slaughter : 15,000 the exclusion zone around the latest outbreak of foot-and-mouth in northumberland is being extended after a case was confirmed outside the cordon around hexham .
farmers ' leaders have welcomed the cull , following confirmation of three more cases in the hexham area on friday , bringing the total to 16 .
defra said the " blue box " exclusion zone stretching from hexham in northumberland to alston , cumbria was 220 square miles -lrb- 352 square kilometres -rrb- .
it had previously been thought that it was 400 square miles -lrb- 640 square kilometres -rrb- .

the 18-year-old was murdered in a sectarian shooting by loyalists in northern ireland on 29 july .
the beautiful game , which was written by lord andrew lloyd webber with ben elton , tells the story of a football team amid the sectarian troubles in 1960s northern ireland .
lord lloyd webber said that he felt " honoured " to be allowed to dedicate the performance to the young man .
" ben elton and i were shocked and saddened by the tragedy of gavin 's death , " he said .
" in writing our musical the beautiful game we wanted to draw attention to the plight of young people and their families trying to live normal lives within a war zone . "
troubles mr brett 's parents flew to london for the saturday performance and lord lloyd webber and elton are to make a donation to a charity of the brett family 's choice .
the beautiful game is based amid the sectarian troubles in northern ireland in 1969 .
it centres on the hopes and aspirations of two groups of teenagers from opposing sides of the conflict .
they strive to escape from the troubles through football and love .
the show was the idea of elton - writer of the hit book and stage show popcorn - while lord lloyd webber wrote the music .
the announcement that he musical was to close came in july blaming poor ticket sales resulting from the tourism slump affecting london 's west end .
a spokesman for the show said that it had lost just under £ 1m in advance bookings from the us due to the drop in overseas visitors to the capital .
the main causes are thought to be fears surrounding the foot-and-mouth crisis and the strength of the pound .
despite its west end closure , the beautiful game will transfer to toronto next year and is also set to go to new york .

the 20-strong team - headed by welsh assembly first secretary rhodri morgan - are hoping to strike new deals during the week-long visit to los angeles .
it is natural for welsh companies to look to la , particularly with catherine zeta-jones based there and the fact that her company is now coming to wales to film elizabeth morgan-hemlock from wild films it is part of an event organised by wales trade international , the assembly 's international trading arm .
forging links between wales and hollywood , the swansea-born actress recently unveiled plans for a feature film to be set in a welsh rugby club .
it will be one of the first films embarked on by milkwood films - the production company set up by miss jones and her brother lyndon .
one of the film companies which has set its sights on los angeles is mountain ash-based wild films they are hoping the starlets success will pave the way for new ventures in the us .
zeta jones has unveiled plans for a welsh-based film the firm 's managing director , elizabeth morgan-hemlock said : " it is natural for welsh companies to look to la , particularly with catherine zeta jones based there and the fact that her company is now coming to wales to film . "
" the trade mission itself will be a good platform for us and will help to open up more doors . "
also in la is cardiff-based production and services company cf1 which has been involved in a string of productions and co-productions .
the company 's head of development elaine huss said : " our latest drama development is a film on the early life of tom jones , and it is possible that one of two us-based contacts may become involved as co-developers .
we are also looking for a us distributor for our film , alone . "
ghetto mentality last month the uk film minister kim howells warned the welsh film industry against creating a " ghetto mentality " .
mr howells , the mp for pontypridd , wants the industry to take its lead from the commercial lead of hollywood .
the minister said he was against any attempts to make it an overtly welsh industry , urging leading figures to open it up and run it like a business .
he warned he would try to stop efforts to project " art house " images of " racial purity " in wales through films .
