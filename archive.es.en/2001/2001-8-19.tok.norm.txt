ballot papers are due to be sent out on monday to party members as the battle between iain duncan smith and ken clarke enters its final stages .
mr duncan smith 's team has been buoyed by receiving the endorsement of william hague and two sunday newspapers .
but mr clarke 's camp has emphasised the need to win back the voters that mr hague failed to attract in the last election .
hague 's backing departing leader mr hague has revealed that he favours the shadow defence secretary as his successor because he fears mr clarke could split the party over europe .
his backing came in a letter to the chairman of his richmond constituency association , ron kirk , obtained by the sunday telegraph .
mr hague said he had " a particularly high regard " for mr duncan smith .
he praised him for his qualities including his " strong and sound beliefs " , " integrity and courage " and " highly effective leadership " .
he added : " i fear the alternative to his election would be for our party to slide back into the divisions over europe we have done so much to move away from . "
and he said he would cast his vote for mr duncan smith to be his successor .
new poll a poll in the sunday telegraph suggests mr duncan smith 's popularity has grown during the campaign .
a fifth of tory voters polled by icm said they were more likely to back a party led by the shadow defence secretary , compared with 14 % for mr clarke .
the sunday telegraph and sunday times also set out their support mr duncan smith .
the sunday telegraph described mr clarke as " dangerously out of step " with the party on europe , while praising his rival as " easily the most successful of mr hague 's team " .
the sunday times praised mr duncan smith for his " decency , tenacity and energy . "
the battle between the pair intensified on saturday when mr clarke launched a strong attack on his rival , accusing him of being a " complete unknown " who wanted to take britain out of the european union .
tory party members have until noon on 11 september to return their ballot papers .
counting will begin the following day .

the 45 were found guilty of staging protests and manufacturing banners and leaflets countering the government 's official line that the movement , which teaches meditation and exercise , is an " evil heretical cult " .
heretical writings the heaviest punishment , a 13-year prison term , was imposed on zhang hwangei , who was accused of arranging accommodation for falun gong supporters visiting beijing from other parts of china .
falun gong was banned in 1999 by the ruling communist party , which accuses the movement of wanting to overthrow the government .
two other defendants , shao qiang and qiu xiuxin , were jailed for 10 years for making banners and encouraging supporters to raise them in tiananmen square - a focus of falun gong protests before the sect was banned .
hunger strike meanwhile , eight members of the movement launched a hunger strike outside the chinese embassy in washington , demanding the release of supporters held in chinese jails .
hefty prison terms the strikers intend to drink nothing but water and sleep in their cars , and have pledged to keep up the protest for as long as possible .
in the past two years , falun gong says more than 50,000 followers have been sent to prisons , labour camps and mental hospitals .
human rights groups say about 200 of them have died from torture during detention , and followers are often sent to camps before receiving a trial .
the government has acknowledged several deaths in custody , but has attributed these to suicide or ill-health .
suicide sentences on friday , a further four alleged members were jailed for organising a mass suicide attempt in beijing .
one man was sentenced to life imprisonment and three others to terms of between seven and 15 years for encouraging members of falun gong to set themselves alight in tiananmen square in january .
falun gong says none of them were members , and says its teachings do not condone suicide .

hunger strike meanwhile , eight members of the movement launched a hunger strike outside the chinese embassy in washington , demanding the release of supporters held in chinese jails .
the strikers intend to drink nothing but water and sleep in their cars , and have pledged to keep up the protest for as long as possible .
in the past two years , falun gong says more than 50,000 followers have been sent to prisons , labour camps and mental hospitals .
human rights groups say about 200 of them have died from torture during detention , and followers are often sent to camps before receiving a trial .
the government has acknowledged several deaths in custody , but has attributed these to suicide or ill-health .
suicide sentences on friday , a further four alleged members were jailed for organising a mass suicide attempt in beijing .
one man was sentenced to life imprisonment and three others to terms of between seven and 15 years for encouraging members of falun gong to set themselves alight in tiananmen square in january .
falun gong says none of them were members , and says its teachings do not condone suicide .

a reuters news agency report claims it was told by a colombian judicial source that deportation was likely but it would not be before next wednesday .
this is a possible punishment for carrying false passports .
the three men were arrested on 11 august in colombia 's capital bogota on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities with the farc after leaving an area controlled by the rebel force .

she said there was no connection between any work he did in cuba and anything he may be suspected of doing in colombia .

the chilean president said he had spoken to mr bush on behalf of the rio group of latin american leaders , which wound up a two-day meeting in santiago on saturday .
one issue dominated the summit - the economic crisis facing argentina and its potential impact on the region should the country fail to repay its debts .
argentina has asked the international monetary fund for billions of dollars of aid to help it through .
regional threat if argentina sinks , analysts warn the entire region will suffer the economic consequences .
toledo 's war is on poverty that is why the group members asked their host to speak directly to president bush about cooling jittery markets .
in his closing speech , president lagos said he had got the assurances they were after .
the united states , he said , is very interested in finding an adequate and lasting solution to the problems in the financial markets , particularly in argentina .
" president bush indicated that the us administration , secretary of state -lrb- colin -rrb- powell , treasury secretary paul o 'neill , are particularly worried about finding a sustainable , adequate solution to what is occurring particularly in argentina , " president lagos told a news conference .
president lagos said the technical details still had to be worked out , but that help would be forthcoming .
that may not necessarily come in the form of cash , as argentina wants , and there is still no guarantee that the assistance will solve the crisis , but mr bush 's promise does represent a step forward .
central bank the chilean president also said the rio group had agreed to consider the idea of a latin american central bank for central banks , as a kind of safety net to avoid future economic crises .
that is still a long way off and there is no guarantee that it will protect latin america from economic problems , but it also represents a breakthrough in the region 's thinking .
separately , peru 's new president alejandro toledo announced that the foreign ministers of peru and chile will meet on 10 september to find ways to cut the two countries ' arsenals .
