britain is understood to have offered to train units of crack commandos to boost their chances of reclaiming villages which have been seized by the guerrillas .
the macedonian army has made little headway in battling the rebels , who are now just five miles from the capital skopje , after four months of fighting .
the guerrillas , known as the national liberation army -lrb- uck -rrb- , are demanding better rights for ethnic albanians and have proved themselves more than equal to the macedonian soldiers they are confronting .
mediation the uck also wants international mediation of the conflict and a new constitution which would stress that macedonians and albanians are equal national groups in the same state .
britain is offering to train the parts of the macedonian army to improve their capability .
they would concentrate on training special units of assault troops , remedying a serious gap in the macedonian forces .
a shaky ceasefire declared last monday is in place to allow the macedonian government to explore a possible peace plan , but if the talks break down , the fighting is expected to resume with greater ferocity , which would lead to their army needing outside assistance .
resentment macedonia 's albanian community accounts - according to official figures - for 23 % of the two-million-strong population , but ethnic albanians say the real figure is more like one-third .
much of their resentment stems from what they see as their second class status .
a recently-formed grand coalition government - which brought together the political left and right as well as macedonians and ethnic albanians - has so far failed to produce a blueprint for ending the conflict .

the prime minister attacked the demonstrations , blaming an " anarchists ' travelling circus " for the violence .
it is thought three protesters were hurt after police opened fire with live ammunition , one of whom is critically injured .
british protesters reportedly played a key role in the demonstrations and swedish police revealed that a british man was among those still in custody after being arrested at the scene .
this effectively is an anarchists ' travelling circus that goes from summit to summit with the sole purpose of causing as much mayhem as possible tony blair the prime minister said : " such protests must not and will not disrupt the proper workings of democratic organisations . "
his comments came at the end of a two-day meeting overshadowed by clashes with police involving hundreds of rioters .
" it is very sad that this has happened , not so much for us , because the leaders will be all right , but for thousands of ordinary citizens who have been put in danger and at risk , " mr blair said .
' no room ' for anarchy he said that although there was a place for peaceful protest , people had no right to engage in " undemocratic anarchy " .
" peaceful protest is an essential part of a democracy , violent protest is not , and has no place in a democracy .
" this effectively is an anarchists ' travelling circus that goes from summit to summit with the sole purpose of causing as much mayhem as possible . "
anti-globalisation and anti-eu protesters threw fireworks and stones at police , who fought back with clubs .
some mounted police were thrown off their horses .
police sealed off a shopping mall in the centre of town after a suspected bomb was found .
demonstrators tried repeatedly to get close to the conference hall where the 15 eu leaders were meeting , and at one stage were reported to be less than a mile away .
and on friday , the leaders were forced to abandon their formal dinner because of the trouble .
full alert police in gothenburg remained on full alert on saturday as the summit ended , fearing another round of the clashes .
meanwhile , europe 's leaders issued a declaration aimed at reassuring countries in line to join the eu .
the issue of enlargement of the union received a set-back when irish citizens voted against the nice treaty in a referendum .
eu leaders insisted the treaty , which streamlines eu administration to make enlargement practical , can not be changed .
deadline the eu leaders set a deadline of the end of 2002 to complete negotiations with the applicant countries , with full eu membership now targeted in time for them to offer up candidates for the elections to the european parliament in 2004 .
mr blair said : " it is incredibly important to all those countries which were formally a part of the soviet bloc and which have come to democracy : we are talking about the security and prosperity of millions of people . "
meanwhile , in the uk , mr blair was facing renewed pressure to mount a campaign for british entry into the single currency in the wake of his landslide election victory .
the new chairman of the european movement , former tory trade minister ian taylor , told the organisation 's annual conference in cardiff that to stay out would cost british jobs and impact on uk profits .
" tony blair 's unprecedented second landslide , after a campaign in which no-one could doubt the main parties ' positions on europe , gives the government precisely the authority it needs to lead a great national debate about britain 's future in europe , " mr taylor said .
" it is not only his right , but his responsibility to do so . "
staying out of the euro would demote britain to an " outer tier of lesser influence " which would weaken britain " enormously " .
earlier europe minister peter hain repeated a call for people to " cool it " over british entry into the single currency .
asked at the end of the eu summit in gothenburg , sweden , whether he had come under any pressure from fellow european leaders to push ahead with british entry into the euro , mr blair responded : " no " .

bbc news -pipe- from our own correspondent -pipe- ireland casts shadow over europe low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : world : from our own correspondent front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo sunday , 17 june , 2001 , 08:26 gmt 09:26 uk ireland casts shadow over europe the ' no ' vote took many people by surprise by ireland correspondent kevin connolly if you travel ireland with an english accent and what the bbc still quaintly refers to as a portable recording device , it is one of the moments you learn to dread .
perhaps two pints into a five pint evening , the eyes of the singer on stage will find you across a smoky , crowded room .
it is your turn .
the understanding is plain - you are recording and enjoying that indefinable quality of atmosphere known in irish as the craic .
it is only right therefore , that you should provide a little .
interestingly , it does n't matter whether you provide entertainment by singing in a voice of startling purity , or by stumbling along in a wobbly baritone .
the point is to participate .
capital of europhilia we were in lough rea , a town chosen by the irish authorities to promote awareness of the european single currency .
in a country of euro-enthusiasts , it is the capital of europhilia and sees itself as a kind of bridgehead for ireland into the new europe that the new money will create .
still - a piece along the lines of the country singing about the past while planning for the future was taking shape nicely .
you might even have heard it .
i felt it was n't a good idea to sing about a type of suffering for which the locals might well hold me indirectly responsible choosing a song is never easy ... the rebel repertoire is best avoided , and even non-political standards tend to dwell on unpromising subject like armed robbery in the wild colonial boy and alcoholism in practically all the others .
lough rea is not far from the fields of athenry , an area which once inspired a catchy tune about starvation , theft , transportation and the break-up of a family .
but apart from the fact that the locals are probably bored to tears with the song , i felt it was n't a good idea to sing about a type of suffering for which they might well hold me indirectly responsible .
i settled , in the end for the " irish rover " - a jaunty look at maritime disaster and mass bereavement and stumbled through it happily enough until i found i could n't remember what order people died in , and thus , ingloriously conked out .
national mood my point in all of this was that the process by which we made our initial contacts was entirely random and yet when we did our interviews with the local business community the following morning there was not a hint that the irish electorate was preparing to throw a spanner in the works of the european process by rejecting the treaty of nice .
only an estimated 30 % cast their ballots the managing director of a family clothing shop was confident of the national mood .
" it 's part of the irish character , " he assured me .
" we 've been helped up ourselves and now we want to help others who are worse off . "
a boutique owner 's only reservation about the single currency was that it could n't come quickly enough - trading through sterling would become inconvenient and expensive - and even small children knew the rate of the euro against the irish pound .
british euro-sceptics , it was suggested , were at best living in the past , at worst touched with lunacy .
a prosperous place the underlying reasons for ireland 's euro-scepticism are obvious enough .
the country 's roads and airports alone bear witness to the huge financial benefits which eu membership has brought .
the result said much more about ireland 's relationship with referendums than it did about ireland 's relationship with europe and diplomatically it has changed ireland 's horizons , helping to erode its ties to britain .
now it 's true that that has been changing .
ireland is a prosperous place these days and will soon be a net contributor , not a net beneficiary .
and it 's also true that a country with a troubled agriculture sector does n't feel that what the eu needs is a sudden influx of poor farmers .
there are genuinely-held doubts about whether ireland 's cherished neutrality can survive in a more centralished union .
bertie ahern : too wily to tell the electorate they got it wrong but i think the treaty of nice result said much more about ireland 's relationship with referendums than it did about ireland 's relationship with europe .
this is the fifth time the irish people have been asked to vote on a european matter and two trends have been unmistakeable : declining turnout and declining majorities in favour of the proposition .
the prime minister , bertie ahern , is too wily a character to be caught telling the electorate they got the result wrong - there 'll be much talk of listening to their concerns .
but it 's likely the european union will go on preparing for expansion on the assumption that sooner or later ireland will vote " yes " .
in a sense of course it has to , and it 's quite likely to turn out to be right when the question is put again next year .

perhaps two pints into a five pint evening , the eyes of the singer on stage will find you across a smoky , crowded room .
it is your turn .
the understanding is plain - you are recording and enjoying that indefinable quality of atmosphere known in irish as the craic .
it is only right therefore , that you should provide a little .
interestingly , it does n't matter whether you provide entertainment by singing in a voice of startling purity , or by stumbling along in a wobbly baritone .
the point is to participate .
capital of europhilia we were in lough rea , a town chosen by the irish authorities to promote awareness of the european single currency .
in a country of euro-enthusiasts , it is the capital of europhilia and sees itself as a kind of bridgehead for ireland into the new europe that the new money will create .
still - a piece along the lines of the country singing about the past while planning for the future was taking shape nicely .
you might even have heard it .
i felt it was n't a good idea to sing about a type of suffering for which the locals might well hold me indirectly responsible choosing a song is never easy ... the rebel repertoire is best avoided , and even non-political standards tend to dwell on unpromising subject like armed robbery in the wild colonial boy and alcoholism in practically all the others .
lough rea is not far from the fields of athenry , an area which once inspired a catchy tune about starvation , theft , transportation and the break-up of a family .
but apart from the fact that the locals are probably bored to tears with the song , i felt it was n't a good idea to sing about a type of suffering for which they might well hold me indirectly responsible .
i settled , in the end for the " irish rover " - a jaunty look at maritime disaster and mass bereavement and stumbled through it happily enough until i found i could n't remember what order people died in , and thus , ingloriously conked out .
national mood my point in all of this was that the process by which we made our initial contacts was entirely random and yet when we did our interviews with the local business community the following morning there was not a hint that the irish electorate was preparing to throw a spanner in the works of the european process by rejecting the treaty of nice .
the managing director of a family clothing shop was confident of the national mood .
" it 's part of the irish character , " he assured me .
" we 've been helped up ourselves and now we want to help others who are worse off . "
a boutique owner 's only reservation about the single currency was that it could n't come quickly enough - trading through sterling would become inconvenient and expensive - and even small children knew the rate of the euro against the irish pound .
british euro-sceptics , it was suggested , were at best living in the past , at worst touched with lunacy .
a prosperous place the underlying reasons for ireland 's euro-scepticism are obvious enough .
the country 's roads and airports alone bear witness to the huge financial benefits which eu membership has brought .
the result said much more about ireland 's relationship with referendums than it did about ireland 's relationship with europe and diplomatically it has changed ireland 's horizons , helping to erode its ties to britain .
now it 's true that that has been changing .
ireland is a prosperous place these days and will soon be a net contributor , not a net beneficiary .
and it 's also true that a country with a troubled agriculture sector does n't feel that what the eu needs is a sudden influx of poor farmers .
there are genuinely-held doubts about whether ireland 's cherished neutrality can survive in a more centralished union .
but i think the treaty of nice result said much more about ireland 's relationship with referendums than it did about ireland 's relationship with europe .
this is the fifth time the irish people have been asked to vote on a european matter and two trends have been unmistakeable : declining turnout and declining majorities in favour of the proposition .
the prime minister , bertie ahern , is too wily a character to be caught telling the electorate they got the result wrong - there 'll be much talk of listening to their concerns .
but it 's likely the european union will go on preparing for expansion on the assumption that sooner or later ireland will vote " yes " .
in a sense of course it has to , and it 's quite likely to turn out to be right when the question is put again next year .
but i ca n't help feeling that even the euro-enthusiasts of lough rea might feel their democratic hackles rising at the thought of being taken too obviously for granted .
i think i 'll pay a return visit before ireland votes again , drawn by something even more intriguing than the prospect of hearing a few songs poured in a smoky room .

lawyers for the family of a couple who were killed when their ford explorer overturned in may 2000 say that anything less " would just be a slap on the wrist and business as usual . "
edelio and norma herrera died as the family was returning from a trip to disney world .
their car was equipped with wilderness at tyres which have now been recalled .
more than 170 deaths have now been linked to accidents involving ford explorers equipped with firestone tyres , and ford has now ended its relationship with the tyre-maker .
ford has warned its shareholders that it could face up to $ 10bn in lawsuits arising from the ford explorer deaths .
firestone has argued that it was design flaws in the vehicle , not the tyres , which were the main cause of the accidents .
but ford is now planning to demand that firestone shares the cost of replacing its tyres .
richard parry-jones , head of ford 's global product development and quality , said : " the issue of whether or not we will recover , seek to recover , any money from firestone as a result of this will be something that we 'll be paying more attention to and considering more deeply in the coming few weeks . "
ford cut ties last month ford recalled all 13 million firestone tyres at a cost of $ 2.1bn , marking the end of its 100-year relationship with us tyre-maker .
" we do not have the confidence in these tyres to keep our customers safe , " said jacques nassar , chief executive of ford at a press conference .
firestone said that it will no longer supply its products to ford .
" business relationships , like personal ones , are built upon trust and mutual respect , " said firestone 's chief executive john lampe .
" we have come to the conclusion that we can no longer supply tyres to ford since the basic foundation of our relationship has been seriously eroded . "
the company will take the $ 2.1bn charge in the second quarter and expects it to weight heavily on its earnings .
the world 's second largest carmaker has also suspended its share buy back .
ford says it will suspend production of some vehicle lines to make more tyres available to those already on the road .
the recall is expected to take up to nine months and firestone 's rival goodyear has said it is working closely with ford to address the problem .
' safety concerns ' firestone 's john lampe also criticised the ford for being " unwilling " to share any information with firestone on the ford explorer .
" our initial analysis ... suggests very strongly that there are safety concerns with a large segment of the ford explorers on the road today , " he said .
" our tyres are absolutely safe and yet they replaced tyres in venezuela and ford explorers continue to roll over , " he added .
" we believe they are attempting to divert scrutiny of their vehicle by casting doubt on the quality of firestone tyres .
the tyres are safe . "
pr campaign firestone has begun a public relations campaign in recent weeks , after enduring months of public scrutiny that included testimonies before the us congress by ford and bridgestone-firestone officials .
tyres made by firestone , a unit of japan 's bridgestone , are alleged to have contributed to more than 120 deaths in north and south america alone .
nashville , tennessee-based firestone says its " making it right " advertisement stresses the tyre manufacturer 's goal of increased quality control and hopes to rebuild consumer confidence , following the explorer debacle .
bridgestone 's stock price has taken a hit , having fallen 40 % from year-ago levels .
