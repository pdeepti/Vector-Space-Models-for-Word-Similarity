it will be the first time in three years the queen mother has attended remembrance day .
the 101-year-old had an emergency blood transfusion for anaemia in august and has had health problems around 11 november for the last two years .
we very much hope she will be well enough to attend clarence house spokeswoman there were fears she could miss this year but clarence house announced she hoped to " witness " the ceremony at the cenotaph on remembrance day .
she will also visit the royal british legion field of remembrance at westminster abbey on 8 november , when she will be accompanied by the duke of kent , clarence house said .
the two engagements were announced as " additions " to her diary and a clarence house spokeswoman said it was routine to announce the queen mother 's engagements within weeks of the events .
remembrance regular " we very much hope she will be well enough to attend , " she added .
the queen mother has been a regular at remembrance day events and cemented her place in the nation 's heart when she refused to leave london during the horrors of the blitz .
she was forced to miss last year because of a broken collar bone , and was not at the cenotaph in 1999 because of a chill which kept her indoors .
in 1998 she witnessed the ceremony from the balcony at the foreign office , which overlooks the cenotaph .
royal british legion spokesman charles lewis said he was " delighted " to learn that the queen mother hoped to witness this year 's ceremony .
health fears " she makes every effort to be there if she can , " he said , adding : " we would be delighted . "
health fears for the senior royal grew this summer when she was said to be suffering from " mild heat exhaustion " after braving soaring temperatures to carry out official engagements .
blood tests showed she was suffering from anaemia and she was given an emergency transfusion and left hospital on 2 august , just two days before her 101st birthday .
doctors advised her to rest but she made a public appearance at clarence house on her birthday before holidaying in the scottish highlands .
she underwent further medical tests last month , at aberdeen royal infirmary , and has attended church services in balmoral and accompanied the prince of wales on a visit to alford , aberdeenshire , earlier this month .

a greater sense of urgency has been given to the whole industry david walsh , video meeting company firms selling video conferencing equipment say they have seen a massive increase in demand since 11 september .
the technology has been around for years .
but often poor sound and picture quality has meant people have preferred to travel to meetings , despite the cost and time involved .
high-speed networks have now allowed much higher quality video links to be established , and the industry is hoping that new converts to the technique will stick by it even when security fears ease .
instant reaction in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks there was a " huge surge " in demand for conferencing services , said martin brommell , global marketing manager at bt conferencing .
bt saw demand for video conferencing rise by 85 % in the week following the attacks .
while demand has subsequently cooled , it is still 25 % higher than normal .
video meeting company , another firm in the market , revealed a similar scenario .
the company 's marketing director david walsh said the firm saw a huge increase in interest after the attacks , which has been maintained into october .
" a greater sense of urgency has been given to the whole industry " since the events of last month , he said .
companies that had previously been undecided about the systems were now buying them .
long-term customers ?
operators are now hopeful that video conferencing will now become an everyday way of communicating within and between firms .
david walsh said it can often take a one-off event for a piece of technology to come into its own , noting that the use of faxes really took off in the uk following a number of mail strikes .
and with the economy slowing , travel budgets are often the first items to be cut when firms look to trim costs .
" although it 's unfortunate with the combination of recession and the war , people have got to look to alternatives , " he said .
costs costs for video conferencing equipment vary widely depending on what type of system is chosen .
the video meeting company said an average system will cost about £ 6,500- £ 7,000 , including installation and training .
when installed it costs about £ 9 an hour for use within the uk , and about £ 120 an hour to the us .
another video conferencing company , teliris said its system has eliminated any delay on or loss of sound , and delivers dvd quality pictures .
but it does not come cheap - installation costs start at $ 120,000 -lrb- £ 83,000 -rrb- per room .
it also costs $ 13,000 -lrb- £ 9,000 -rrb- a month for a dedicated fibre-optic line , although this is kept open all the time and can be used to transmit data as well as pictures .
teliris - which is chaired by former bbc news presenter martyn lewis - said the quality of its sound and pictures made it the first of a new generation of video conferencing operators .
mr lewis claimed that if you are using the link to deliver bad news to someone " you can actually see their cheeks reddening . "
and he said the technique is cost effective .
not only are savings made on both air-fares and time , but executives are also able to work more effectively because they are not jet-lagged .
family-friendly but video conferencing will never completely replace the need for meetings in the flesh , said angela baron from the chartered institute of personnel and development .
" there are always going to be some times when you need to meet face-to-face , " she said .
" you 'll never get all the nuances of a meeting through video conferencing . "
she added that there is room for many different types of communication within a firm - phone , fax , e-mail and video conferencing .
" it is important that companies learn to recognise what is the most appropriate form of meeting in the different circumstances . "
video conferencing could be a great relief to over-stressed executives who rarely get to spend any time at home , she added .
" it could be a boon for family friendly policies because people wo n't be constantly jetting off to other places . "

however , the opposition has also made gains in both the parliamentary and municipal elections and , for the first time , is likely to be strongly represented on many local councils .
president ould taya had promised to improve multi-party democracy opposition spokesmen have said the parties were satisfied with the conduct of the election , but will make a statement once all the results are in .
the election marks a significant stage in moves by president maaouiya ould taya to improve multi-party democracy .
with friday 's results still incomplete and another round of voting in some areas next weekend , it will be a while yet before mauritanians know the full make-up of their 81-seat national assembly .
but even now , it is clear that the ruling prds , the party that supports president ould taya , will have a majority in the assembly .
opposition gains the opposition , which only had one seat in the outgoing legislature due to a boycott of the last election , have already won in the region of 10 seats and are likely to take several more yet .
those seats are split between several parties .
but there are two main beneficiaries - the rally of democratic forces and action for change .
more representative the opposition is hopeful for substantial gains in the municipal elections which also took place on friday .
technically , mauritania has had a multi-party system for 10 years .
but it has never functioned properly because the voting system kept all but the biggest party from winning seats .
that has now changed , and president ould taya does seem to be making good his promise to give the opposition parties a role in decision making .
he needs a consensus to implement an economic austerity programme that is being coupled with measures to deal with the worst poverty .

it is the first major political statement in the 12-year history of the asia-pacific economic co-operation group -lrb- apec -rrb- , a body normally dedicated to trade .
in their final statement at the end of two days of talks in shanghai , the leaders said terrorist acts were a profound threat to the peace , prosperity and security of all people , of all faiths , of all nations .
the declaration , read by chinese president jiang zemin , continued : " terrorism is also a direct challenge to apec 's vision of free , open and prosperous economies . "
but there was no direct mention of afghanistan or osama bin laden in the statement , which the bbc 's adam brookes in shanghai says highlights the discomfort felt by mainly-muslim malaysia and indonesia over the us attacks on the country .
the statement urges all governments to prevent and suppress all forms of terrorist acts in the future .
and it calls on member countries to move to prevent the flow of funds to terrorists .
on economic matters , the leaders also said they were committed to maintaining public confidence by fighting protectionism and launching a new round of talks to tear down barriers to global commerce .
they also committed themselves to speed up the progress of achieving free trade among developed members by 2010 and for developing countries 10 years later .
bush plea on saturday , president george w bush urged apec to unite against terrorism , promising that the 11 september attacks would not stop the building of free markets and free trade around the world .
mr bush said the war on terrorism was " a fight to save the civilised world , and values common to the west , to asia , to islam " .
he is due to hold talks with president putin on sunday .
both the russian and chinese presidents have called for the us-led campaign in afghanistan to move rapidly to a political solution .
mr putin was the first world leader to telephone mr bush on the day of the attacks to offer his condolences - the first move in a rapidly developing new alliance between the two former cold war foes .
president bush has used the apec summit to reach out to regional leaders to boost support for the coalition against terrorism .
on saturday , he assured malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad , one of the most outspoken critics of the attacks on afghanistan , that the united states was trying to be " as careful as we possibly could " to avoid civilian casualties in afghanistan .
