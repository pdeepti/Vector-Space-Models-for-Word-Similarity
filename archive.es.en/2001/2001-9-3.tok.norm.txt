british diplomats say they are sticking to the line that european countries agreed on before the beginning of the united nations world conference on racism in durban , south africa .
this is to accept that the slave trade was deeply regrettable , but not to apologise or to agree that it was a crime against humanity .
spain , portugal and the netherlands are believed to be in sympathy with britain .
all four were heavily involved in the slave trade .
other countries that were not , led by belgium , which holds the european union presidency , want to move closer to african and black american demands for an apology .
britain and the others fear that an apology would put them into unchartered territory in terms of international law .
it would certainly increase demands from some african countries and many black american groups that those countries that traded in slaves should pay reparations .
the question of reparations for slavery has been one of the most divisive issues at the conference .

efforts by the government to bolster demand will prove insufficient to save the economy from ending 2001 smaller than at the beginning of the year , economists surveyed by the monetary authority of singapore concluded .
" they do not expect the off-budget package introduced recently to provide much support for domestic economic activity , " said mas , singapore 's central bank .
the government has introduced a $ 2.2bn rescue package , including extended tax rebates and accelerated spending on infrastructure projects , in an effort to bolster the economy .
economic gloom the survey 's results will deepen the gloom hanging over singapore , which in july revealed it had become one of the first country 's to enter recession amid the global economic slowdown .
while singapore economy shrank 0.6 % in the april-to-june quarter , compared with the same period in 2000 , the government is still forecasting growth of 0.5-1.5 % this year .
the economists surveyed by mas also predicted a slump in exports , with forecasts ranging from minus 11-15 % .
but most of the gurus surveyed saw trade reviving next year , in line with a recovery in technology markets .
the economists saw the economy expanding by 4.8 % next year , compared with a government forecast of 9.9 % growth .
free trade talks the survey comes as singapore and japan have resumed discussions aimed at sealing a free trade agreement by the end of the year .
the discussion are believed to involve the elimination of tariffs on almost all goods , with the notable exception of agricutural products .
japanese farmers enjoy heavy trade protection .
singapore has already sealed a free trade deal with new zealand , and is exploring similar agreements with the us , australia and mexico .

the 13,000ft-high eiger , german for ogre , is steep , exposed to bad weather , almost constantly in shadow even in summer , presents alternating bands of difficult rock and ice , and is notoriously loose .
anyone brave enough to attempt the 6,000ft wall - the nordwand - has to risk a fusillade of falling rocks .
to avoid this particularly lethal danger some choose to climb the face in the coldest conditions when the rocks are more likely to be fozen in place .
eiger facts height : 13,000ft , 3,970 metres first climbed in 1858 north wall 6,000ft high north face first climbed 1938 first direct route 1966 north face deaths : more than 50 many of the big walls of the european alps were scaled in the years following climbing 's golden era of the 19th century but the north face of the eiger remained unclimbed until 1938 when a team of four managed to succeed where many had died trying .
traumatic tale the first to get really high on the face were max sedlmayer and karl mehringer who in 1935 were halted by bad weather .
their bodies were spotted weeks later .
the following year saw one of the most traumatic episodes in the eiger 's history .
click here to see the classic route up the eiger four young climbers - andreas hinterstoisser , edi ranier , willy angerer and toni kurz - made a renewed attempt on the north wall .
hinterstoisser opened up a route to the summit with a brilliant traverse but it could not be reversed without a rope in place .
after being caught up in a huge storm they were unable to retreat the way they had come and all four were killed .
toni kurz perished hanging from his abseil rope only feet from a rescue team .
' i can not go on ' the would-be rescuers tried to reach the stricken climber from a window which emerges onto the face from the railway tunnel running right through the mountain .
but a knot prevented him sliding any further towards the outstretched arms and his own fingers were so badly frozen he could not free himself .
the rescuers had to withdraw for the night despite the stricken climber 's pleas not to be left alone .
when they returned the next morning he was much weaker and with the words " ich kann nicht mehr " -lrb- i can not go on -rrb- he died almost within reach of safety .
after more failed and fatal attempts to climb the mountain by its most difficult face , a group of four finally managed to put up a route .
two germans , anderl heckmair and ludwig -lrb- wiggerl -rrb- vorg , and the austrians fritz kasparek and heinrich harrer , joined forces in 1938 to make the first ascent .
the dramatic tale was recounted in harrer 's book the white spider which is named after the distinctive ice field near the summit and has become a mountaineering classic .
fixed ropes the climbers were paraded by adolf hitler in a propaganda exercise .
harrer later spoke of his discomfort about the chapter and vorg was killed on the russian front only a few years later .
more dramas followed .
in 1957 italian climber claudio corti was the only survivor from a four-man team after he was winched to safety from the summit .
and in 1962 , british climbers chris bonington and don whillans , who were themselves attempting an ascent , went to the aid of brian nally .
his partner barry brewster was killed in a rock fall but nally was saved by the pair .
chris bonington was again involved with another eiger epic in 1966 when a new , more direct route was being tried - in winter .
using big expedition tactics of installing fixed ropes as they climbed , thereby allowing the mountaineers to descend and then quickly regain their previous high point , more than a dozen climbers forced the route with this so-called siege technique .
climbing classics the white spider by heinrich harrer in high places by dougal haston savage arena by joe tasker clouds from both sides by julie tullis all 14 eight-thousanders by reinhold messner touching the void by joe simpson chris bonington was photographing the climb for the daily telegraph newspaper but ended up joining the expedition himself .
but tragedy struck yet again as the team neared its goal .
american climber and driving force behind the direct route , john harlin , fell 5,000ft after one of the fixed ropes snapped .
the climb which was named after him was not repeated until nearly four years later when it took almost three months of endeavour to make the second ascent by the harlin direct route .
despite its grim history the world 's greatest climbers have continued to test themselves on the north wall of the eiger .
reinhold messner - probably regarded as the most successful mountaineer ever , having scaled all 14 of the world 's 8,000-metre peaks - climbed the classic route at breathtaking speed and made the first ascent of the eiger 's north pillar .
the face which earned it the nickname death wall continues to live up to its reputation and those who want to enjoy the mountain without the enornmous risks involved in stepping on to the eiger 's northern aspect are best advised to view it from the valley bottom or from the mountain railway . -lrb- click here to return -rrb- internet links : swissinfo -pipe- eiger north wall - classic mountain zone -pipe- eiger information -pipe- north wall chronology -pipe- the north face route -pipe- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- world contents : africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- from our own correspondent -pipe- letter from america -pipe- back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- ©

some investors have accused the banks of deliberately talking up companies to generate corporate finance work .
but hsbc analysts will now be told to offer as many ' sell ' recommendations as ' buy ' recommendations .
law suits hsbc analysts will no longer be able to hedge their bets by offering ' hold ' recommendations .
the bank will also invest its own money in its recommendations .
investors will now be watching to see if other banks follow hsbc 's lead , in an attempt to restore confidence following the collapse of the dot com bubble .
us banks are facing a barrage of law suits from angry investors who lost money by following analysts ' recommendations as the boom in high-tech shares reached its peak .
imbalance according to the financial times newspaper , bank analysts recommend nine stocks as ' buy ' for every ' sell ' .
hsbc says it is seeking to redress the balance , to provide a more realistic and transparent assessment .
it will ask its analysts to rank stocks by sector , forcing them to choose between , for example , bp or shell , in order to produce as many negative as positive recommendations .
the move will virtually eliminate ' hold ' recommendations .
transparency mark brown , hsbc 's global head of research , said : " hsbc has always been at the transparent end of broker research , but the format and tools launched today -lrb- monday -rrb- will set a new standard for the industry . "
mr brown said the move was not a direct response to recent criticism of city analysts , but part of wide-ranging review of the bank 's global research business which aimed to make it more open and accountable .
" the idea was to make it more transparent and align our interests much more closely with our clients . "
he said some analysts had become " lazy " and resorted too easily to the ' hold ' rating because they do not want to upset clients .
" if you are interested in making a quick buck you will tell people what they want to hear , " mr brown said .
" if you are interested in building a long-term relationship with clients , you will take a different approach . "
making negative recommendations could ultimately strengthen a bank 's relationship with its client , he added .
" we are not making a judgement on the company , just its share price .
" if people are grown-up enough to accept this , they will benefit in the long run , " he added .

the star made the revelation in her book learning to fly , which is being serialised in the daily mail and the mail on sunday .
the spice girl has also revealed she suffered from an eating disorder which she blames on former band member geri halliwell .
i hit him so hard i cut the inside of his mouth victoria beckham meanwhile , beckham played to a less than enthusiastic crowd at radio 1 's one big sunday event in leicester as she was pelted with fruit and vegetables as she performed her new single , not such an innocent girl .
in her autobiography the singer reveals the moment she read about her husband 's alleged infidelity in a newspaper .
it was claimed the england football captain had kissed another girl while the spice girls were on a world tour and victoria was pregnant with brooklyn .
despite his denials , she said she " went straight up to him and just swung at him , punched him in the face " .
she added : " i hit him so hard i cut the inside of his mouth .
even then , with blood dripping down his chin , i just felt angry and hurt . "
she said they were so upset they both contemplated suicide .
anorexia beckham 's book also describes her eating disorder , saying she was " obsessed " with her appearance .
" in the gym , instead of checking my posture or position , i was checking the size of my bottom , or to see if my double chin was getting any smaller , " she wrote .
after her weight dropped following the birth of her son , brooklyn , beckham was led to deny accusations of anorexia in the press .
now she has admitted that in the early days of the spice girls , when they were under pressure from their management to lose weight , dieting was a preoccupation .
beckham said it was geri halliwell who encouraged her and mel c to go running and take liquid meal substitutes .
beckham is in the midst of a publicity campaign in an attempt to secure her first solo number one .
her single is to be released on 17 september , the same day as kylie minogue 's record , ca n't get you out of my head .
but a section of the crowd at sunday 's concert in leicester demonstrated their feelings for posh .
some missiles were thrown at the stage , although none actually hit beckham , according to an eyewitness .
boos and jeers could also be heard from 100,000-strong audience but she continued her performance .
beckham landed what is thought to be the highest price paid for the exclusive serialisation of an autobiography .
the book also describes her husband 's manchester united boss sir alex ferguson as " vindictive " and said he had never said more than " hello " to her in more than four years .
learning to fly , complete with photographs of the star from spotty teenager to plump student to solo career snaps , will be published on 13 september .

a survey of 75 hairdressers found that 20 % of salons see one case of head lice a month .
the poll also found that 96 % had met a customer with head lice at some point in their career .
all hairdressers are advised to check for head lice during consultation alan goldsbro about one tenth of those surveyed said that they would be " disgusted " if they came across a customer with lice , and would refuse to cut their hair .
but most took a rather more constructive approach : 84 % said they would welcome the opportunity to pass on tips on how best to get rid of the parasites .
no formal training more than half had received little or no formal training on head lice detection .
alan goldsbro , chief executive officer of the hairdressing and beauty industry authority -lrb- habia -rrb- said : " all hairdressers are advised to check for head lice during consultation , but this research shows that a large number either do not check their clients for head lice at all or only check when they 'suspect ' a head louse infection . "
mr goldbro said hairdressers had a " vital role " to play in helping to reduce the spread of infection .
it is estimated that 5 % of the community is affected by head lice at any one time .
the study was commissioned by the makers of a head lice treatment , lyclear creme rinse .
lyclear will tomorrow launch a telephone information service for hairdressers and other professionals on 020 7617 0817 .

a research team at the university of strathclyde has developed a new technique that could help patients waiting for a liver transplant .
the researchers have worked out how to store living cells in a device capable of being attached to the body to do the job of damaged tissue .
they say the artificial organs could help millions of patients who suffer from liver disorders .
a similar device implanted into the body could help people with pancreatic conditions , such as diabetes and perhaps replace daily insulin injections .
transplant alternative dr helen grant told the british association festival of science in glasgow that patients with liver and pancreatic disorders could soon be treated and even cured , thanks to the new method .
bio-artificial organs could help patients suffering from acute liver failure whose only hope is a liver transplant , she said .
" this -lsb- liver transplantation -rsb- has an average cost of £ 30,000 to the health service , in addition to the intensive care management of patients to prevent multiple organ failure while waiting for a donor , " said dr grant .
scientists have been working on bio-artificial organs for some years , but have been hampered by the lack of a suitable supply of living cells for the devices .
currently , cells have to be grown up individually each time a device is used , a costly and time-consuming process .
but dr grant 's method of freezing liver cells at -70c in single layers attached to a membrane provides a ready source of tissue for artificial organs .
' significant advance ' the devices , about the size of a shoebox , can be stored at low temperatures , ready to be used when required .
andrew mclaughlin , of the biotechnology and biological sciences research council , which funded the work , told bbc news online : " it 's a significant advance in developing bio-artificial organs that could potentially change peoples ' lives for the better .
" there 's potential for these devices to be available in hospitals throughout the world to treat pancreatic and liver disorders . "

the basis of the pfi is risk transfer , where the private sector supplies a public services at a fixed cost and must absorb any overruns but is entitled to any profits that it can generate .
but criticism over excessive profits , enforcement of penalties , quality of service and has plagued the process .
what risk ?
" risk transfer is about the transfer of obligations which otherwise sit with public sector to the private sector , " said john gains , chief executive , john mowlem and president of the construction confederation .
" the risk all sits with the pfi incumbent .
there can be no dispute .
once the requirements are defined , it is up to the private sector to deliver the product , " he adds .
in exchange , the private sector charges a premium for designing , building , financing , operating and maintaining facilities for up to 30 years for a fixed cost .
pfi forces the public sector client to specify exactly what infrastructure and services it wants in advance and what it is prepared to pay per year .
the private sector has the incentive to deliver the buildings on time , or face penalties , and within budget , or absorb the overruns , and to keep the cost of services down to make a profit .
but when contracts have failed to deliver , as happened at the passport agency and other it contracts , the penalty clauses against the companies ended up being unenforceable because the government had to rely on the companies that created the mess to get them out of it .
finance initiatives initially financiers underwriting pfis were worried that they had no recourse to recoup costs from the public sector if things went wrong .
but their fears were allayed once contractors started delivering on time and the revenues for the 30 year service agreements started to come in .
" the city is catching up fast .
there 's been a tremendous uplift their understanding of pfi , " said john gains .
he thinks profit margins are unlikely to shrink through competition because of the sheer number of new pfis the government plans to bring onto the market .
refinancing the hospital deal provided a health profit funding for pfis has now become cheaper , as the profits roll in , allowing some of the early deals to be refinanced , further enhancing profits .
when the consortium behind the norfolk and norwich nhs trust pfi refinanced their debts it gave it a £ 70m profit boost , which will come out of the taxpayers pockets .
it is the equivalent cost of building a new nhs hospital .
but consortiums argue that the bonus from refinancing recognises the risks they took when initially bid for the contracts .
company benefits a treasury budget report shows that the first £ 14bn of pfi deals signed will give the private sector a guaranteed £ 96bn return over 26 years but industry denies it is profiteering .
" there is no evidence of companies making outlandish returns , but there are many suppliers to the public sector that make outlandish margins , " says mr gains .
but it is only a select group of companies in the construction and services sector , backed by the major financial institutions , that benefit from pfi projects " only big companies with hefty asset levels are allowed to bid for pfis and the need for consortiums demonstrates that even big companies sometimes have trouble meeting the pfi rules , " says james hastings of the construction forecasting and research group .
" it 's only once a pfi has been signed that small companies get any work and then its just like any other subcontracting job , " he adds .
an example is engineering and construction group balfour beatty , one of the preferred bidders for london underground ppp , which reported in august that pfis underpinned its 17 % rise in underlying profit growth .
balfour beatty has 11 pfi deals but failed to gain any new ones in the first half of this year but chief executive mike welton said that even if it signs no more the existing ones will provide a steady stream of earnings over the coming years .
similarly amec reported a 20 % rise in first half profits also underpinned by the governments pfi programme .
other big construction groups like carillion , alfred mcalpine and laing are reinventing themselves to take advantage of the pfi contracts as are service companies like capita , serco and amey .

some privatisations have been more successful than others by the bbc 's economics correspondent jenny scott the private finance initiative -lrb- pfi -rrb- tends to be viewed with suspicion .
the idea of companies making money out of traditional public sector projects like building hospitals makes many people uncomfortable .
the pfi is well worth it to bring in capital which otherwise might not be available david currie , city university high profile cases opposing a bigger role for private companies - such as london mayor ken livingstone 's battle to stop private companies running the underground - have done little to improve the pfi 's image .
but emotive issues aside , does the policy make economic sense ?
what is it ?
the pfi was introduced in the early 1990s by the conservatives .
it involves private companies being appointed by public bodies to design , build and pay for capital projects such as roads , hospitals and schools .
in other words , the private sector puts the money up front and the public sector pays an annual charge over the subsequent 30 years or so .
the government asks the private sector to put the money up front and then pays it back through annual charges .
the taxpayer still pays the bill gavin kelly , ippr in return for being paid for building the project , the private sector is also meant to assume the financial risk - so that if the project has a cost-overrun they have to pay , not the government .
two arguments are typically put forward in favour of the pfi .
firstly , that it is a good way of financing expensive projects that might otherwise not be undertaken , and secondly that it offers better value for money than purely publicly funded endeavours david currie at city university says the level of investment that would be required for some projects like building new schools would spark talk of a fiscal crisis if it was funded with government money .
" the pfi is well worth it to bring in capital which otherwise might not be available , " he says .
it 's a framework to bring in money for services which otherwise might be left to languish , such as schools . "
questions over funding however , others dispute that logic .
gavin kelly is research director at the institute of public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- , and is co-author of a comprehensive analysis of the pfi .
he says using the policy as a way of loosening the constraints on capital investment is a particularly bad rationale for the initiative .
" it 's just an accounting device , " he says .
" the government asks the private sector to put the money up front and then pays it back through annual charges .
the taxpayer still pays the bill . "
and , he points out , if this was the only rationale , then the government could borrow the money more cheaply on private capital markets itself .
kelly says the second argument - that pfi projects offer value for money - is much more important .
the theory is that private money brings with it better management plus greater incentives to finish projects on time and within budget .
evidence lacking hard evidence on that is woeful .
advocates of pfi point to the fiasco over the jubilee line extension on london 's underground .
funded and managed by the public sector , it suffered huge delays and went well over budget .
however , gavin kelly says the policy has had mixed results .
" from what we could tell it seems there is a strong reason for thinking the pfi is delivering real value for money in some sectors like prisons and roads , " he says .
" but in hospitals and schools there 's no evidence of significant gains , and in some cases there have been significant losses . "
there is also some controversy over where any value for money comes from .
if it is driven by cuts in workers ' terms and conditions rather than by genuine innovation , then efficiency gains are questionable .
rather than creating economic benefit , money is simply being redistributed from staff to private company shareholders .
room for improvement ?
abandoning the private finance initiative now would be costly .
the policy is in its infancy and is still being finessed .
there are also gains to be seen from the pfi that deserve time to mature .
however , improvements could be made .
gavin kelly at the ippr says the government should consider other ways of getting the money to invest in long-term capital projects , rather than relying so heavily on pfi .
" the government should stop and think why it 's doing so many pfi projects when the evidence does n't necessarily support it , " he says , adding it should be bolder and experiment with different ways of procurement that preserve efficiency incentives .
" it should also evaluate pfi projects more closely and be willing to change policy in light of any evidence .
we need to make sure government departments have a real choice . "
it may be many years before it is possible to finally decide whether pfi was a good deal for the government .
but with the policy still at an early stage , there are likely to be more twists and turns before any final judgement is made .
