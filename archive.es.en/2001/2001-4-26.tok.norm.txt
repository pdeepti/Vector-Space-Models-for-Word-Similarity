but it is not the only issue that the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and world bank must contend with at their annual spring meeting nations , which starts thursday .
a row has developed between europe and the us over how to handle the economic slowdown , with us treasury secretary paul o 'neill lobbing criticism at his european counterparts for their decision to stand pat on interest rates .
" once conditions reach the degree of tension , which they clearly have , there is no substitute for a face-to-face exchange of views , " says csfb chief economist giles keating .
" they they 'll agree to stop blasting each other in public , " mr keating says .
that will come on saturday when the g7 finance ministers , including mr o 'neill will meet informally on the sidelines of the imf gathering .
the tension stands in sharp contrast to the unity at the g7 meeting last september in prague , when ministers endorsed moves by the federal reserve and other central banks to help prop up the euro .
the g7 , or group of seven nations , include the us , canada , germany , france , italy , britain and japan .
economic slowdown the imf , which is due to release its semi-annual world economic outlook on thursday , has sharply slashed its economic forecasts for global growth .
it now says - in a document that has been widely leaked -that world growth will slow to just above 3 % this year .
the jury is still out on whether the us will lead the world into a recession .
much of the recent economic data out of washington shows that while the us economy is slowing , it is not heading for recession - which is negative growth .
however , us growth will slow to 1.5 % this year , from 5 % in 2000 , then pick up to 2.5 % in 2002 , the imf predicts .
on tuesday , president george w bush 's nominee to lead the council of economic advisors , robert glenn hubbard , told the senate banking committee that the us is in a " growth slowdown " .
" the rate of growth is unacceptably low , " he said .
" but we are not in the present time , at least , likely to be in a recession , " professor hubbard told the committee .
help for the poor the global slowdown is exacerbating the problems of developing countries , some of whom are in negotiations with the imf for further aid .
and it has increased pressure for further concessions to the world 's poorest countries , where campaigners have been pressing for the imf and world bank to cancel their debts entirely .
" many of these countries , particularly extremely poor countries , are spending more on servicing their debt , than they are on healthcare , for example , " robert naiman , senior policy analyst at the center for economic policy and research in washington , dc , told bbc online .
the imf and the world bank are public institutions that exist to promote development and address poverty , mr naiman argues .
and many people regard it as absurd and obscene that countries such as mozambique and zambia , some of the poorest countries in the world , would be diverting resources from urgent human needs to spend on servicing debt .
the imf and world bank , which have approved debt-relief programmes for 22 highly-indebted countries at the end of last year , says that to increase debt relief further would jeopardise lending to other countries .
protests muted last but certainly not least is the possibility of protests by anti-globalisation forces , like those seen in quebec city last weekend , when the three-day meeting of western hemisphere nations was marred by fiery protests with police responding with tear gas and over 400 arrests .
both the imf meeting in prague in september , and its spring meeting in washington last april , faced mass protests from thousands of demonstrators objecting to the organisation 's role in managing the world economy .
while some demonstrations are expected in washington , meeting officials do not expect them to resemble the riots seen in quebec city or seattle in 1999 .
demonstrators have said they are saving their fire for the september meeting .
the world bank says the subject of this year 's meeting will be on how to reduce poverty among the poorest nations .
when officials look back , however , resolving conflict may be the overriding theme .

in a letter to the attorney-general john ashcroft , published in the washington post newspaper , officials said they needed nearly $ 60m to fight the case , but had been given less than $ 2m .
the justice department filed a lawsuit two years ago accusing the big tobacco companies concealing information showing that smoking can be harmful .
the lawsuit is entering a critical phase , and the memo said without more funds than presently proposed that they would not be able to continue pursuing the case and that a settlement was unlikely .
tobacco foes urge action mr ashcroft said during his confirmation hearings that he had " no predisposition to dismiss " the lawsuit and that he would review the facts of the case before deciding how to proceed .
tobacco foes say that time as well as money is critical if the suit is to continue .
william v. corr , executive vice president of campaign for tobacco-free kids , said : " the memo makes it clear that if this review continues much longer , it will have the effect of killing the lawsuit by denying the department 's lawyers the funding they need to continue the litigation .
" no decision is a decision to stop the lawsuit . "
the justice department alleges that cigarette companies have conspired to defraud and mislead the american people since the 1950s .
the suit named philip morris inc . ; philip morris companies ; r.j. reynolds tobacco co . ; american tobacco co . ; brown & williamson tobacco co .
inc . ; liggett and myers inc . ; the council for tobacco research u.s.a. inc. and the tobacco institute inc .
the government sought $ 100bn in damages for the healthcare costs of smoking-related illness .
tobacco wins partial victory but the suit has faced obstacles both in the courts and in congress .
a judge threw out a large part of the suit last autumn saying that the government had based part of its case on the flawed interpretation of two federal laws .
but the judge ruled the government could not use medical-care cost recovery laws to recoup the costs of treatment due to the tobacco-related illnesses .
the government estimated that it has spent $ 20bn annually for the last 40 years on smoking-relating costs .
but it was not a complete victory for the tobacco industry that had asked the judge to throw out the entire case .
the judge said " a significant portion of the government 's case " could proceed under federal racketeering law and that the tobacco industry could still be liable for billions of dollars .
controversy in congress justice department officials would not say whether mr ashcroft will push for the funding the tobacco litigation team has requested .
however , mr ashcroft was a vocal critic of the suit when he served in the us senate .
and he was not the only opponent of the litigation in congress .
last year , congress agreed - under pressure from then president clinton and anti-tobacco campaigners - to fund the suit with $ 12m that was originally intended for other government agencies .
and mr dubray said that if history is indication , this congress would not support a budget line-item for specifically funding the suit .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- taiwan sub deal under threat bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point thursday , 26 april , 2001 , 05:32 gmt 06:32 uk taiwan sub deal under threat by rob broomby in berlin plans by us president george w bush to sell weapons including eight diesel-powered submarines to taiwan have received an embarrassing setback at the hands of european governments .
neither the germans nor the dutch , the only two countries producing the diesel engines , are willing to allow the sale of the subs to taiwan .
that leaves mr bush in the unusual position of having promised to sell technology his country does not control , and may have difficulty supplying .
the military package is at the centre of a row between the united states and china , which has angrily condemned what it calls interference in its sovereign affairs .
us government officials implied recently that the germans or the dutch may be able to supply the controversial subs .
however juergen rohweder , a spokesman for the german shipbuilders , hdv , told the bbc : " we have not been asked by the us or the taiwanese governments to sell the submarines . "
he admitted the company would like a share of the $ 1.1bn deal , but " the german government rules are clear " , he said : " it 's not allowed . "
exports forbidden michael steiner , senior foreign policy adviser to chancellor gerhard schroeder , was equally categorical .
" no application has been made and it would never be approved . "
german and dutch rules forbid arms exports to regions in crisis , and few relationships are as tense as that between china and taiwan , which beijing regards as a renegade province .
london-based defence analyst , paul beaver , of jane 's , the military analysts , said : " no european union country would consider selling to taiwan . "
that leaves the united states in the unusual position of trying to work up its own submarine project .
the only company that could provide such submarines would be the mississippi-based shipbuilding firm ingalls , but they have not built a diesel-powered submarine since the 1960s .
no plans company spokesman randy belote told the bbc : " we have the capacity and capability to assist with the project , " but admitted the firm did not have a design to work with .
" there are designs out there , " he said , enigmatically , but refused to be drawn on the timescale for developing a diesel-powered submarine .
the company now builds nuclear powered vessels , a very different enterprise .
defence experts doubt that ingalls could build submarines that the taiwanese could afford , as they would be starting almost from scratch .
" i wish them luck , " said an official in berlin with a touch of sarcasm .
the speculation began after a briefing by white house press secretary ari fleischer .
he was asked by reporters on tuesday whether the germans or the dutch had been consulted about the taiwanese arms sale .
he said that " procurement decisions , contracting decisions " would be made " down the road " and " it would not be appropriate to make those decisions or consultations prior to the announcement to the taiwanese of the weapons that we are prepared to sell to them " .
the diesel subs would be part of a package of advanced us arms which would include kidd-class destroyers and p-3c submarine-hunting aircraft .
angry reaction china condemned the military package , even though it did not include state-of-the-art aegis destroyers asked for by taiwan .
chinese state television quoted vice foreign minister li zhaoxing as saying the deal was tantamount to " open provocation " .
" the us behaviour can only bring arrogance to taiwan separatist forces aiming to split china , " mr li was reported to have told the us ambassador to beijing , joseph prueher .
the bush administration in turn said beijing could stem the flow of weapons to taiwan by toning down its military threat to the island .
relations between washington and beijing are still strained as they negotiate the return of an american spy plane , forced down on the island of hainan in the south china sea , after a mid-air collision with a chinese fighter plane .

controversy in congress justice department officials would not say whether mr ashcroft will push for the funding the tobacco litigation team has requested .
however , mr ashcroft was a vocal critic of the suit when he served in the us senate .
and he was not the only opponent of the litigation in congress .
last year , congress agreed - under pressure from then president clinton and anti-tobacco campaigners - to fund the suit with $ 12m that was originally intended for other government agencies .
and mr dubray said that if history is indication , this congress would not support a budget line-item for specifically funding the suit .

neither the germans nor the dutch , the only two countries producing the diesel engines , are willing to allow the sale of the subs to taiwan .
that leaves mr bush in the unusual position of having promised to sell technology his country does not control , and may have difficulty supplying .
president bush may have promised more than he can deliver the military package is at the centre of a row between the united states and china , which has angrily condemned what it calls interference in its sovereign affairs .
us government officials implied recently that the germans or the dutch may be able to supply the controversial subs .
however juergen rohweder , a spokesman for the german shipbuilders , hdv , told the bbc : " we have not been asked by the us or the taiwanese governments to sell the submarines . "
he admitted the company would like a share of the $ 1.1bn deal , but " the german government rules are clear " , he said : " it 's not allowed . "
exports forbidden michael steiner , senior foreign policy adviser to chancellor gerhard schroeder , was equally categorical .
" no application has been made and it would never be approved . "
german and dutch rules forbid arms exports to regions in crisis , and few relationships are as tense as that between china and taiwan , which beijing regards as a renegade province .
london-based defence analyst , paul beaver , of jane 's , the military analysts , said : " no european union country would consider selling to taiwan . "
that leaves the united states in the unusual position of trying to work up its own submarine project .
the only company that could provide such submarines would be the mississippi-based shipbuilding firm ingalls , but they have not built a diesel-powered submarine since the 1960s .
no plans company spokesman randy belote told the bbc : " we have the capacity and capability to assist with the project , " but admitted the firm did not have a design to work with .
ingalls website offers a range of services - but not diesel subs " there are designs out there , " he said , enigmatically , but refused to be drawn on the timescale for developing a diesel-powered submarine .
the company now builds nuclear powered vessels , a very different enterprise .
defence experts doubt that ingalls could build submarines that the taiwanese could afford , as they would be starting almost from scratch .
" i wish them luck , " said an official in berlin with a touch of sarcasm .
the speculation began after a briefing by white house press secretary ari fleischer .
he was asked by reporters on tuesday whether the germans or the dutch had been consulted about the taiwanese arms sale .
he said that " procurement decisions , contracting decisions " would be made " down the road " and " it would not be appropriate to make those decisions or consultations prior to the announcement to the taiwanese of the weapons that we are prepared to sell to them " .
the diesel subs would be part of a package of advanced us arms which would include kidd-class destroyers and p-3c submarine-hunting aircraft .
angry reaction china condemned the military package , even though it did not include state-of-the-art aegis destroyers asked for by taiwan .
chinese state television quoted vice foreign minister li zhaoxing as saying the deal was tantamount to " open provocation " .
" the us behaviour can only bring arrogance to taiwan separatist forces aiming to split china , " mr li was reported to have told the us ambassador to beijing , joseph prueher .
the bush administration in turn said beijing could stem the flow of weapons to taiwan by toning down its military threat to the island .
relations between washington and beijing are still strained as they negotiate the return of an american spy plane , forced down on the island of hainan in the south china sea , after a mid-air collision with a chinese fighter plane . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's adam brookes " america likes to keep everybody guessing as to how far they would intervene " the bbc 's rob watson " us policy on taiwan has always been deliberately ambiguous " special report key stories : mending bridges in asia website war bush 's balancing act chinese fury analysis strategic balance taiwan and china war games tension nervous neighbours beijing 's brinkmanship spy plane row who caused the crash ?

" i deny allegations of being involved in a plot to challenge the presidency of the anc , " mr ramaphosa said in a statement .
ramaphosa is now one of south africa 's leading businessmen south african security minister steve tshwete said in a television interview that he was concerned that there was a deliberate misinformation campaign against mr mbeki that could put him in physical danger .
mr phosa was reported in the local press as dismissing talk of a plot as " rubbish " .
" the allegations are not worthy of any comment ...
they accuse us of horrendous things and that is a provocation .
i am not going to jump around as if i am guilty , " he said .
' presidential aspirations ' all three are no longer directly involved in politics but they are still members of the ruling african national congress .
security minister steve tshwete did not specify exactly what the men are thought to have done but it is known that they have had presidential aspirations in the past .

the matter that 's arising is the manner in which people pursue their ambitions president thabo mbeki the bbc southern africa correspondent says president mbeki 's critics say he is increasingly plagued by fears of conspiracies from those around him , and accuse him of using the state apparatus to persue personal political vendettas .
in the television interview , mr tshwete said that there were rumours being circulated that mr mbeki was behind the 1993 assassination of communist party leader chris hani .
chris hani was seen as one of nelson mandela 's potential successors and therefore a rival to mr mbeki .
" chris -lsb- hani -rsb- was an idol of everybody in the country ... and to say that the president of the anc was behind the assassination is actually to set him -lsb- up -rsb- for physical assault , " mr tshwete said .
national concern mr tshwete said the allegations were not simply an internal anc party matter and the police were involved because the safety of the country 's president is its responsibility .
the allegations surfaced when a former anc youth leader james nkambule made a statement to police that he attended meetings at which senior anc officials plotted to undermine mr mbeki .
also speaking on south african television , mr mbeki said that there was a conspiracy to oust him .
" people have got natural ambitions .
some people want to be president of south africa , that 's fine .
" the matter that 's arising is the manner in which people pursue their ambitions . "
our correspondent in south africa says the questions the matter raises concern the nature of mr mbeki 's leadership .
the white-dominated opposition democratic alliance likened it to that of richard nixon during the watergate crisis of the 1970s .

former conservative mp tony marlow - whose land has been earmarked for genetically modified maize trials - met with worried locals at his farm at castle cenlas on wednesday night .
three sites in wales were announced earlier this month by the department of the environment - despite the welsh assembly 's hopes of keeping wales gm-free .
assembly members are expecting to find out on friday whether assembly agriculture minister carwyn jones has the power to prevent the trials taking place .
representatives from the doe , the assembly , and seed producers aventis joined local crop-growers at the four-hour meeting .
the farmers - worried that their livelihoods could be at stake if the gm crops cross-pollinate with their own - emerged from the talks saying their views had not changed .
aventis made no comment , but it was clear the company had not responded to calls to abandon the planting .
scientific report there was widespread anger among ams when it was revealed that welsh agriculture minister carwyn jones - already under pressure from the foot-and-mouth crisis - had not told them that trials would be taking place on the three welsh sites .
the assembly is now waiting for an official scientific report before making a decision to try to challenge the genetically-modified crop trials in wales .
that report could be made public on thursday when assembly officials are due to meet acre , the official committee looking at gm crop trials .
two farms at mathry and another at sealand in flintshire have been chosen for the experiments .
after a special meeting called during their easter recess ams appeared relatively satisfied that mr jones was doing all he could to realise the assembly 's aspirations for a gm-free wales .
preseli pembrokeshire mp jackie lawrence has warned that if the planting does go ahead , the assembly could be faced with serious public order issues at the sites .
last october , the assembly voted 42-10 against the seeds -lrb- national list of varieties -rrb- regulations 2000 , which have already been approved by england , scotland and northern ireland .
ams began debating the issue of gm seed regulations a year ago and the former assembly agriculture secretary christine gwyther was pressed to come up with a " gm-free wales " policy .
last year , gm crop trial farmer john cottle said he would continue to allow the crops to grow sealand , flintshire , despite damage by protestors .
until now that trial - on the border with england - had been wales 's only gm experiment .

former conservative mp tony marlow - whose land has been earmarked for genetically modified maize trials - met with worried locals at his farm at castle cenlas on wednesday night .
test crops : a field of gm maize three sites in wales were announced earlier this month by the department of the environment - despite the welsh assembly 's hopes of keeping wales gm-free .
assembly members are expecting to find out on friday whether assembly agriculture minister carwyn jones has the power to prevent the trials taking place .
representatives from the doe , the assembly , and seed producers aventis joined local crop-growers at the four-hour meeting .
the farmers - worried that their livelihoods could be at stake if the gm crops cross-pollinate with their own - emerged from the talks saying their views had not changed .
aventis made no comment , but it was clear the company had not responded to calls to abandon the planting .

in shareholder 's minds he is linked with the strategy that saw bt accrue £ 30bn worth of debt , and so in recent months pressure had grown for him to leave the company .
the company 's share price jumped as news broke that he had resigned , to be replaced by the bbc 's sir christopher bland .
sir iain had been expected to step down in july next year .
his early departure could be seen as an unfortunate end to a career which has delivered much , if promised more .
it was sir iain , after all , who is credited with persuading the then conservative government to privatise bt .
privatisation pioneer his career in the sector began in 1966 when , after an education in london , scotland and oxford , he joined the post office , of which his father had been scottish director .
helped by an masters degree from london business school , he rose to join the inaugural bt board when the telecoms business was formed as a separate unit in 1981 .
his reward for securing the privatisation of bt three years later , a move which set a trend for state-owned telecoms firms around the world , was to be appointed chief executive by 1986 , and take on chairmanship as well a year later .
he held the two roles through a troubled period for bt , as the company struggled to overcome the unrest associated with its transformation into a private company .
huge workload under sir iain 's stewardship , bt implemented a massive programme of job cuts -lrb- the firm 's workforce nearly halved in its first 14 years as a plc -rrb- .
little wonder that in 1995 he announced he was to hand over the role of chief executive , and with it a huge workload , to peter bonfield .
" the combination of the two roles has real merit in the period of unprecedented change following bt 's privatisation , " sir iain said .
" but the board has agreed , on my advice , that a return to a more conventional separation of the roles is now appropriate . "
resignation rumours officially , sir iain ceded even more control when his chairmanship became part-time in 1998 .
many observers , however , feel he has reduced his obligations as chairman only to allow him to retain an executive role .
which is one reason why sir iain has been the target of so much of the criticism aimed at bt - to the extent that the firm took the highly unusual step in october of issuing a press release denying that he was about to quit .
whatever bt 's successes under sir iain 's leadership , the firm can not be said to have achieved the global position he has so often promised and which , through deals such as the proposed mci merger , at one time looked attainable .
other analysts believe that , judged from today 's standpoint , sir iain retains too much of the public sector ethos to oversee the next round of transformation bt so sorely needs tive director with the shortest cv .
