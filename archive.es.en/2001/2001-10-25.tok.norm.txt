the agency hopes to replace thousands of posts lost recently in the it and telecommunications sectors .
agency staff will be flying around the world to highlight the region 's availability of skilled workers .
the drive to bring more hi-tech jobs is to continue even though a number of electronic and engineering firms in devon have announced large numbers of redundancies .
nortel networks on tuesday announced that 700 workers are to lose their jobs at its devon plant .
this brought the number of nortel job losses in paignton to almost 4,000 since february .
american-owned internet equipment maker jds uniphase announced in august that it was closing two factories in plymouth .
job loss worries were then compounded by aircraft turbine manufacturer centrax announcing on wednesday that 250 posts were to be lost from its factory in newton abbot .
attracting business however , the regional development agency says it is still important to try to attract this sort of business .
it believes information technology and hi-tech telecommunications are still an important growth area .
the agency says the fact that workers have been made jobless is all the more reason for trying to bring in new employers to take up the available labour .
the agency says it is going to be represented at two information technology trade fairs which will take place in las vegas and india .

negotiations with debt holders aim to hammer out a restructuring plan that would involve the 131-year-old us company filing for bankruptcy protection .
chiquita has been hit by losses of more than $ 1.5bn over the last eight years during a prolonged so-called " banana war " with the european union over imports from former european colonies .
the company hopes to reach an agreement with its creditors on the restructuring of $ 841m of debts .
" what we were was a good company with a bad balance sheet and we hope to become , through this process , a good company with a good balance sheet , " said chief executive steven warshaw .
the planned measures would dilute the existing shareholders ' stake in the company .
chiquita 's shares have fallen about 50 % this year .
on wednesday , the stock fell 9.65 % to 75 cents .

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- smoke hinders swiss tunnel rescue categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : europe front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 25 october , 2001 , 06:33 gmt 07:33 uk smoke hinders swiss tunnel rescue the fire spread quickly after the accident firefighters and rescue workers have been unable to reach the heart of a fire inside the gotthard road tunnel in switzerland which has killed at least 10 people .
thick acrid smoke was still pouring from the tunnel entrance on thursday morning , nearly 24 hours after a head-on collision between two lorries .
suddenly there was smoke and i could n't see anything lorry driver marco frischknecht one of the trucks was carrying tyres and tarpaulins which caught fire and the intense heat is reported to have brought down part of the tunnel roof .
police fear more bodies could be trapped in wreckage close to the fire .
swiss president moritz leuenberger said many people had escaped using the ventilation system and emergency exits .
running for their lives the tunnel , at 15 kilometres -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- long , is the second-longest in the world and the main route through the alps from germany to italy .
some drivers abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot .
others are thought to have been trapped by the flames and the collapse of the tunnel 's roof .
" suddenly there was smoke and i could n't see anything , " said lorry driver marco frischknecht .
" i tried to reverse but there were so many people i had to give up , " he said .
the surviving driver of one of the lorries which crashed said he had managed to escape from his vehicle and direct other people away from the crash site about 2km -lrb- 1m -rrb- from the tunnel 's southern exit .
police spokesman mario ritter said rescuers struggled to reach the site .
" the heat is too high and there is zero visibility , " he said .
about 150 firefighters and other rescuers worked through the night .
safety fears people living near the entrance have been warned to stay indoors and close their windows as smoke billowed from the accident site .
the tunnel has been more heavily used since the 1999 mont blanc tunnel fire , which killed 39 people .
that tunnel remains closed .
but swiss officials said the inclusion of a service tunnel - which the mont blanc tunnel did not have - in the design of the gotthard tunnel had saved many lives .
this was an accident that was waiting to happen .
local politician markus gisler in addition , automatic barriers stopped any more traffic from entering the tunnel , ventilation systems switched to their emergency settings and rescue workers were alerted within minutes .
but the bbc 's correspondent in switzerland , emma jane kirby , says that the accident will fuel already-strong opposition to the heavy lorry traffic in narrow alpine tunnels .
" this was an accident that was waiting to happen .
the gotthard tunnel has just one lane in each direction in a single corridor , " said local politician and tunnel safety campaigner markus gisler .
thick black smoke has billowed from the tunnel 's ventilation points the european union commissioner for transport , loyola de palacio , has also called for more freight to be transported through the alps by train .
" the absolute priority for the long term is to put into service as soon as possible new railway routes , " she said .
switzerland has already begun work on a rail tunnel under the gotthard pass which is set to open in 2012 and on the loetscheberg tunnel which should open in five years ' time . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jon sopel " rescue service still have not been able to reach the seat of the fire " the bbc 's james coomerasamy reports from the tunnel entrance see also : 24 oct 01 -pipe- business tunnel crash blow to trade 24 oct 01 -pipe- europe gotthard : main alpine link 24 oct 01 -pipe- europe in pictures : swiss tunnel horror 24 oct 01 -pipe- europe alps tunnels ' record of danger 07 aug 01 -pipe- europe five killed in austria tunnel fire 28 may 01 -pipe- europe lorry fire closes alpine tunnel internet links : ticino canton -lrb- in italian -rrb- gotthard tunnel -lrb- in german -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top europe stories now : mass resignations rock turkey crash pilots given conflicting orders serbia jails first war criminal new hope for aids vaccine ukraine mine death toll rises russian anti-jewish sign explodes sicilians dish up anti-mafia pasta finland and sweden plan ' eurocity ' links to more europe stories are at the foot of the page .

the company has been hit hard by a fall in demand for its hi-tech products amidst a slowdown in economic growth across the world , and there appears to be little relief in sight .
" current business conditions are far worse than what they were looking at before , " said merrill lynch analyst hiroshi kuriyama ..
" next year will be a difficult time for us , " said president and chief operating officer kunitake ando ahead of the release .
sony was hit by a net loss of 13.18bn yen , -lrb- $ 107m , £ 75m -rrb- during july , august and september .
during the same period last year , sony clocked up 18.7bn yen in profits .
game 's not over the company 's games division was recently given a boost by strong sales of the playstation 2 games console .
sony expects to sell 20 million playstations during this year and next .
that will bring some relief for its main source of revenues ; its electronics division .
sony 's manufacturing operations of electronic components , displays , disc drives and semiconductors have been weak , and recalls of some of its mobile phones have added to its woes .
falling profits sony shares fell 3.43 % to 4,780 yen ahead of the results which were released after tokyo 's stock market had closed .
late last month , sony more than halved its profit forecast for the accounting year that ends in march and announced sweeping changes to its structure .
" we are streamlining and boosting efficiency of operations by introducing better supply chain management , " mr ando said .
but even such a massive revision of its profits forecast failed to bring cheer to the markets as analysts predicted that profits could well fall much further than sony itself was predicting .
