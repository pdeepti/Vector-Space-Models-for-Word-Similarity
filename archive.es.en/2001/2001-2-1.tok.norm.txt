i am deeply worried about general pinochet 's health and i have not the slightest doubt that the entire army is as well general ricardo izurieta the 85-year-old general , who ruled chile from 1973 to 1990 , was officially informed of the charges against him , which stem from a 1973 military campaign against opponents of his rule .
the arrest warrant was delivered to general pinochet at his los boldos residence in bucalemu , 120 kilometres -lrb- 75 miles -rrb- south-west of santiago .
a pinochet spokesman said the former military ruler refused to acknowledge the arrest and intended to appeal within the next five days .
news of the arrest was greeted with delight among human rights campaigners , but the commander-in-chief of the chilean army , general ricardo izurieta expressed concern .
" i am deeply worried about general pinochet 's health and i have not the slightest doubt that the entire army is as well , " he told reporters .
gabriela zuniga , a spokeswoman for the families of the detained / disappeared protest group said : " this is a necessary step so that justice can begin . "
the commander of the chilean navy , admiral jorge arancibia , had earlier warned of potential unrest if an order for the general 's arrest was carried out .
" he who sows the wind , shall reap the whirlwind , " he told the newspaper la segunda .
angry crowd a group of general pinochet 's supporters have again gathered outside his house to protest at the attempt to put him on trial .
they hurled rocks and insults at reporters and angrily surrounded a car that drew up to the gates until they realised its driver was mr pinochet 's youngest son , marco antonio pinochet hiriart .
he later told reporters that he did not expect his father to live long under such stressful circumstances .
" i think that that is what they 'll be satisfied with , judge guzman and the government , when my father dies and all of this is over , " mr added .
retired general luis cortes villa , who heads the pinochet foundation - a grouping of supporters of the former military ruler - tried to calm the crowd .
" this is the saddest and most painful moment that we can possibly have to live through , " he said .
" we were unable to protect the general . "
charges earlier this week , the investigating judge , juan guzman , ruled that general pinochet should be put under house arrest while awaiting trial .
he faces charges of masterminding the killings and abductions of 75 political prisoners in the first weeks after his rise to power in a september 1973 coup .
judge guzman 's order reinstated charges filed against the general on 1 december that were struck down later in the month by chile 's supreme court .
the court had ruled that the judge had failed to interrogate general pinochet or have him submit to medical tests .
medical tests and a brief interrogation were conducted earlier this month .
final results of the medical exam have yet to be made public , but the doctors apparently concluded that general pinochet was suffering from diabetes , heart conditions and " mild to moderate dementia " .
he was treated in hospital over the weekend for a mild stroke .

senior libyan officials later reacted with statements of respect for scottish justice and a desire to restore relations with the us and britain .
at the same time , they said , it was time for un sanctions against libya finally to be lifted .
hassunah al-shawish , assistant libyan foreign minister for media affairs first of all , we respect the judiciary and the law .
this verdict , which was issued according to the scottish law , is not final as far as the defendant who was incriminated is concerned .
we have an opportunity to lodge an appeal in accordance with the law .
as a state , we have nothing to do with this verdict .
two libyan citizens were charged and the united states and britain insisted on trying them there .
so , the verdict is a judicial ruling , but there are other degrees of litigation .
once this verdict becomes final , we will talk about it .
according to what was agreed upon and reached with the un secretary-general , the sanctions should now be completely lifted although they should have been lifted when the two suspects appeared before the court in april 1999 .
today , the fact that the sanctions should be lifted completely is indisputable .
this question , with all its circumstances and consequences , has become history .
we are building our relations and have contacts with the united states .
we restored our relations with britain .
abuzed omar dorda , libya 's un ambassador we are now looking forward to un sanctions being lifted .
libya calls on americans to turn the page on the past .

this case against individuals has nothing to do with libya as a state .

now that the lockerbie case is behind us , we look forward with interest to improving our relations with the united states in the interests of both countries and of peace worldwide .
the sanctions imposed on libya must be lifted completely because the lockerbie case was used as a pretext to delay their lifting .
now that the court has ended the case , the sanctions must be lifted completely .
dr sadiq al-shibani , foreign ministry legal affairs director we were hoping that the verdict would result in the acquittal of the libyan citizens , considering the firm certainty that these two libyan citizens were accused in an illegal and unsound manner .
at the same time we would like to stress our full respect for scottish justice and the reputation it enjoys .
the verdict is the rule of justice which must be respected by all the sides involved in the issue .
the verdict sentencing one of the libyan citizens does not mean the end , and it is not the end of the world .
