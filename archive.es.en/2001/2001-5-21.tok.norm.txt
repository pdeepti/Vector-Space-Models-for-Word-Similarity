the yakutia region is suffering russia 's worst floods in 100 years , although the town which was evacuated last week - lensk - is now free from floodwater .

although mobile phones have long proved useful lifelines in rescue operations , this is believed to be the first time that a text message has been used to locate a casualty .
i could tell he was in pain from his chest injury , but he was able to tell me where he was and that he could hear the helicopter raf pilot officer russ gleeson the 59-year-old man from cheshire , who has not been named , initially used his phone to make a 999 call to north wales police .
he made the call at 1415bst on sunday and explained he had fallen whilst climbing on crib goch in snowdonia and had injured his chest and legs .
officers called in an raf sea king helicopter crew to help in the search .
they could not spot the man and , when they tried to ring him , they were unable to get a signal through .
visitors to snowdon need to warn others of their plans instead they sent a text message asking him to contact them direct .
" this is the first time we have used a text message in a rescue , " said pilot officer russ gleeson , who was based at the aeronautical rescue coordination centre at moray , scotland .
" it was a very good result , " he added .
" we are always ready here to use every weapon in the armoury to save a life .
mr gleeson , 22 , said that after initially failing to get through to the climber , he remembered hearing that sometimes text message could succeed where conventional calls could not be connected .
pilot officer gleeson showed great resourcefulness and ingenuity squadron leader mike nash " i sent off a text and gave the climber one of our direct numbers .
he was on the line within minutes , " he said .
" i could tell he was in pain from his chest injury , but he was able to tell me where he was and that he could hear the helicopter . "
the lifesaving first text message sent from the raf control centre said , simply : " this is the raf .
we are trying to find you .
unable to find you at this moment .
can you contact us ? "
mr gleeson said : " from the instructions he gave me i was able to pass the information via our radio operator to the helicopter crew .
" after giving them some directions , they eventually said they had spotted the casualty . "
phone benefits the climber was winched to safety from the mountain and taken to ysbyty gwynedd in bangor , north wales .
the unusual rescue was believed to be the first time an raf team had used a text message to carry out a rescue operation .
rescuers are convinced that many climbers and walkers who visit remote locations will now recognise the benefis of carrying mobile phones on journeys .
text messaging is now a huge craze , particularly among the young .
' resourcefulness ' industry figures from the mobile data association suggest that almost a billion mobile phone text messages were sent in january this year alone .
mr gleeson 's quick-thinking has won him the praise of his seniors .
squadron leader mike nash , the commanding officer of arcc , said " pilot officer gleeson showed great resourcefulness and ingenuity . "
but , he added : " i would sound a note of caution , however , that people should not over-rely on mobile phone reception .
lives saved " there is still no substitute for people in the hills or at sea to remember to tell someone where they are going and when they will be back . "
last year arcc scrambled helicopters , nimrod maritime aircraft , and mountain rescue teams to 1787 incidents and helped save 1389 lives .
this year alone , they have handled 483 calls , and saved 393 lives .
in february , a british tourist stranded on a stricken boat off the indonesian coast sent a mayday text message to her boyfriend in the uk .
rebecca fyfe , 19 , was rescued after uk coastguards contacted rescue teams in australia who passed the details to the indonesian authorities .

in a country with few decent roads , hardly any working railways and exorbitantly expensive airlines , the rivers in dr congo are important transport routes .
the un humanitarian office in kinshasa has said that the blocking of river traffic has left many in the capital starving .
but the world 's third largest river has been cut in two by the front line that divides government forces and their foreign allies and rebels backed by uganda and rwanda .
economic renaissance rather than ferrying essential foodstuffs down to the capital , kinshasa , it has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting between the two sides .
that now is about to change .
according to french ambassador jean-david levitte , who is leading a delegation of 12 members of the security council to all countries involved in the congolese war , the river is now officially open .
he said it would lead to a renaissance in the devastated economy of the country .
a un boat carrying fuel to the city of kisangani will be the first to cross the front line , on 8 june , and the uruguayan navy will be supplying 250 men to patrol sensitive points along the river .
long-held goal the opening of the congo has for long been a goal of the un , which has been monitoring a ceasefire and pushing the belligerents towards lasting peace .
the security council moves on from congo to zambia on monday , where they will be meeting all the parties to the ceasefire agreement .
there they are hoping for something even more important to congo 's well-being - finalised plans for the withdrawal of all foreign armies .

in a country with few decent roads , hardly any working railways and exorbitantly expensive airlines , the rivers in dr congo are important transport routes .
the un humanitarian office in kinshasa has said that the blocking of river traffic has left many in the capital starving .
but the world 's third largest river has been cut in two by the front line that divides government forces and their foreign allies and rebels backed by uganda and rwanda .
economic renaissance rather than ferrying essential foodstuffs down to the capital , kinshasa , it has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting between the two sides .
that now is about to change .
according to french ambassador jean-david levitte , who is leading a delegation of 12 members of the security council to all countries involved in the congolese war , the river is now officially open .
he said it would lead to a renaissance in the devastated economy of the country .
a un boat carrying fuel to the city of kisangani will be the first to cross the front line , on 8 june , and the uruguayan navy will be supplying 250 men to patrol sensitive points along the river .
long-held goal the opening of the congo has for long been a goal of the un , which has been monitoring a ceasefire and pushing the belligerents towards lasting peace .
the security council moves on from congo to zambia on monday , where they will be meeting all the parties to the ceasefire agreement .
there they are hoping for something even more important to congo 's well-being - finalised plans for the withdrawal of all foreign armies .
troops meanwhile , congolese president joseph kabila has expressed disappointment with the level of un troop contributions to his country .
he said about 20,000 peacekeeping troops were needed to support peace efforts .
the un has so far deployed 1,300 troops to congo .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- markets brace for index rejigging low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo monday , 21 may , 2001 , 06:32 gmt 07:32 uk markets brace for index rejigging by declan curry , bbc breakfast 's shares reporter just four little letters , but they 're enough to cause trembling in the world 's stock markets .
in some parts of the world , the letters spell stock market gloom .
they are responsible for a slide in the value of some of the best-known shares in asia and europe .
but for some british investors , the letters are magic dust , boosting the share prices of some of our biggest companies .
the four letters are msci - the morgan stanley capital index , which is a joint venture of wall street giant morgan stanley -lrb- which owns 90 % of the firm -rrb- and california-based capital group .
hugely influential it keeps thousands of lists of shares from around the world - shares it thinks international fund managers should own .
but it 's more than just who - the lists also say how much of each stock the managers should hold .
the lists are hugely influential .
about $ 500bn of investors ' money worldwide is tied directly to msci 's indexes , invested in passive tracker funds that copy the lists precisely .
but on top of that , there 's another $ 3,000bn invested in funds run by fund managers who use the msci indexes as the basis of their investment decisions .
if a stock 's on the lists , buyers flock from around the world .
if the lists change , the money is soon on the move .
biggest ever shake-up on saturday , msci announced the biggest ever shake-up of those indexes .
it 's news that has had traders around the world nibbling at their fingernails .
shares on many asian markets fell on friday as the markets tried to second-guess the announcement .
though it will be the end of november before the changes start to come into effect , some analysts in the city say they will spark the biggest round of automatic share buying and selling the world 's stock markets have ever seen .
in a nutshell , msci has put a " for sale " sign on global companies that make it difficult to buy their shares .
until now , to get a place on msci 's lists a company had to be first and foremost an attractive investment , while its " weight " in the index was determined by its market capitalisation on the local stock market .
but just because the total value of a company 's shares is $ 1bn , it does n't always follow that there are $ 1bn worth of shares on the market .
many companies do n't put all their shares up for sale because large chunks of stock are owned by the local government , or by other " friendly " companies , or by the families that set the companies up in the first place .
these shares are completely out of reach of other investors , be they local baby-boomers putting money away for their retirement , or major international investment funds .
in addition , some countries fight off global shareholders , by putting a limit on the number of shares that can be owned by overseas investors .
big losers now , msci has decided to mark down those companies that do n't float all of their shares freely on the market .
it 's telling global fund managers that they do n't have to own as much of this hard-to-get stock as they once did .
the underlying logic is : you ca n't drink as much from a small pool as you can from a large one .
the big losers are the companies that once laboured under the hand of state ownership , and countries that keep business in the family .
telecoms will take the biggest punch against any single industry .
until very recently , many countries saw the routing of phone calls as the business of the state .
even with the privatisation of telecoms across most of the world , many governments still own a sizeable part of their former playthings .
these shares are n't available to private investors , so msci has told fund managers to cut back .
car companies , banks , and insurance firms also slide down the rating , either because of partial government ownership or large family shareholdings .
hong kong downgraded many asian countries , with their history of complicated cross-shareholdings and tight family control , are also out of favour .
the japanese market is the biggest faller .
that country 's weighting on msci 's main index has been cut by more than 1 % .
hong kong 's position has also been downgraded , as has the status of the minor markets in india and malaysia .
and there is suffering a little closer to home .
family ownership and company alliances are still part of the business scene in many continental european countries , and for that they are punished .
france , germany , italy and the netherlands have all had their weightings cut .
add in the downgrading of telecoms companies , and major stocks such as france telecom , deutsche telekom and l 'oreal will be flogged off - if they have n't been already .
the prizes go to the anglo-saxons - a reward for the business culture that says the shareholder is king .
msci is telling its followers to pump billions more of their money into shares listed on the new york and london markets .
ca n't be touched the united states and the united kingdom get the biggest increases in weightings on the indices , and analysts at the city firm schroder salomon smith barney reckon that the trans-atlantic bourses could capture another $ 30bn out of that $ 500bn invested in the passive funds that mirror msci 's lists .
best of all for british shareholders , the london market is set to get the lion 's share of that - and we all know what could happen to our share prices when there 's new money flooding into the market .
but not all british shares will be lifted by the rising tide of cash .
even after decades of popular share ownership , some of our companies keep piles of shares tucked away out of reach .
a chunk of shares in the satellite broadcaster bskyb ca n't be touched by private investors - because they 're owned by rupert murdoch 's media empire - and in turn by the murdoch family .
and while it may have been one of the earliest privatisations , not all of the shares in the companies spawned by the old british gas are free to trade on the market .
as a result , fund managers will be advised to dump some of the shares they currently own .
shell to rise ?
the money could flow into british companies that make it into the list for the first time .
msci has increased the number of international firms on its lists from 2,066 to 2,258 .
shell t & t , the london-listed arm of the oil giant royal dutch / shell , gets in for the first time , and is expected to see an improvement in its share prices .
according to schroder salomon smith barney , other big british gainers will include associated british ports and daily mail & general trust .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- jetlag ' shrinks the brain ' low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo dr kwangwook cho , author of report " it looks like there is a high chance -lsb- that jetlag damages the brain -rsb- " real 28k monday , 21 may , 2001 , 08:10 gmt 09:10 uk jetlag ' shrinks the brain ' the brains of aircrew were compared frequent flyers who repeatedly suffer jetlag could be permanently affecting their brain power , claim researchers .
the study , published in the journal nature neuroscience , examined the brains of aircrew , but suggests that any worker who swaps from night to day shifts over a short period may be at risk .
jet lag happens when a traveller passes over a number of time zones and disrupts the normal " circadian " rhythms which help humans wake up in the morning and go to sleep at night .
we think of jet lag as a kind of nuisance , but this study would suggest that it may have more serious consequences dr robert sack , oregon health sciences university sufferers feel exhausted , disorientated and often can not sleep .
dr kwangwook cho of the university of bristol conducted a small study of 20 women , aged between 22 and 28 , who had worked for at least five years for an airline , and regularly flew across at least seven time zones .
half of the women , however , had on average least a fortnight to recover from their jetlag - the rest had only a week .
women were chosen for the test because , in general , they suffer far worse jetlag than their male counterparts .
memory tests dr cho not only scanned their brains to look at their physical characteristics , but also measured their performance in memory and understanding tests .
he found that the aircrew given the shorter period to " turn around " after a jet-lagging flight had an area of the brain called the temporal lobe which was noticeably smaller than the others .
dr cho said : " i found there was no deficit of language , but certain short-term objective memory and very simple abstract cognition was quite bad . "
it is not known whether the temporal lobe will " recover " given time away from such sleep-disrupting working patterns .
brendan gold , from the transport and general workers union , told the bbc : " we 're going to have to look at some more research - perhaps even commission some ourselves , to look at the long term effects on crew , including those who have retired from the occupation . "
dr robert sack , of the sleep disorders medicine clinic at the oregan health sciences university in portland , said : " it 's interesting because we think of jet lag as a kind of nuisance , but this study would suggest that it may have more serious consequences . "
the study , although small , could have implications for a variety of workers whose hours switch backwards and forwards from day to night , such as police officers and doctors .
previous studies have suggested a link between working night-shifts and both heart disease and breast cancer .

anne kidd , 32 , from leeds , and anna bartlett , 22 , from southend , were sentenced by the sharia court in the northern emirate of ras al khaimah on sunday .
a third briton , daniel maalouf , 28 , from london , was sentenced to 10 years in jail , while abdul hamid dandashi , a 25-year-old lebanese man was given a four-year jail term for drug use .
kidd 's lawyer , dr ibrahim al-mulla , told the bbc the judgment came as a shock .
" i really did not expect that ... we are going to appeal because i know my client did not deserve that verdict , " he said .
another lawyer acting for both women , mohammed al-kamali , also said he would appeal against the sentences .
possible reductions but he stressed that islamic law can be humanitarian and , while life sentences mean 25 years in jail , the women could get considerable reductions for good behaviour .
after the verdicts , lawyers for kidd and bartlett said the pair were " relieved " to have escaped the death penalty , which may be given to drug traffickers under a 1995 islamic law .
the defendants were arrested in november and charged with a variety of drug-related counts ranging from trafficking , dealing , possession and use .
kidd was convicted of " using and distributing drugs " and bartlett of " using , trafficking and importing drugs " into the emirates .
both were also ordered to pay 50,000 dirhams -lrb- £ 10,000 -rrb- .
maalouf was convicted of " intent to traffic " in drugs .
fresh trials all three must now face additional drug-related charges at a trial in dubai , with a date yet to be set .
no verdict was recorded in the cases of two other britons , but they could also face a fresh trial in dubai .
a foreign office spokeswoman confirmed that stacy simpson , 25 , from leeds and katherine jenkins , 29 , an emirates airlines flight attendant from cimla , neath , south wales , would be transferred to dubai where they face further unspecified charges .
the foreign office would not comment on individual cases , but a spokesman said : " all five of the britons have the right of appeal .
" whether they will exercise that right is a matter for them and their lawyers .
" we can not interfere in the judicial process . "
drugs easily available the bbc 's frank gardner says despite the strict penalties for those who are caught , drug use is common among the expatriate community in the uae .

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- decision day for gm farmer low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo monday , 21 may , 2001 , 09:31 gmt 10:31 uk decision day for gm farmer north wales farmer john cottle is expected to reach a decision on whether or not to abandon controversial gm crop trials at his flintshire farm .
mr cottle - who grew genetically-modified fodder maize in his fields at sealand last year - has so far refused to bow to pressure from environmentalists and politicians .
former mp tony marlow abandoned crop trials at mathry but assembly rural affairs minister carwyn jones met with mr cottle last friday to press for an end to the trials - two weeks after the seed was planted .
mr jones wants to create a " gm-free wales " , which some experts believe could kick-start wales 's flagging farming industry .
two separate gm trials that were planned at mathry in pembrokeshire , west wales , were called off when landowner tony marlow accused the government of providing misleading details on the experiment .
protesters at mathry , backed by mp jackie lawrence , took their case to environment minister michael meacher .
full debate now attention has switched to mr cottle , who has consistently advocated the benefits of conducting the trials .
the farmer had earlier resisted calls from assembly agriculture committee chairman glyn davies to abandon the government-backed scheme .
the assembly has said it wants mr cottle to remove the seed from his fields for the time being in order for the gm issue to be fully debated .

the figures for january-march revealed strong domestic demand for imported consumer goods , particularly cars .
the office for national statistics also said the uk 's deficit in trade with non-eu countries rose to a greater than expected £ 2.66bn in april .
this compared with a revised £ 2.64bn in march and economist expectations of a £ 2.5bn april deficit in non-eu trade .
analysts said the figures were slightly surprising but in keeping with recent trends .
they said they expected the trend of a widening deficit to continue in the next few months because of weaker exports , particularly to the united states , where economic growth has slowed .
weak us , strong pound the office for national statistics said the uk 's global trade in goods in march recorded a deficit of £ 2.88bn compared with a revised £ 2.29bn in february .
total goods exports were 4 % lower at £ 16.1bn while imports dropped 0.5 % to £ 19bn .
exports to non-eu countries were down 8 % , reflecting the us economic slowdown .
exports to the eu were 1.5 % lower , partly because the strengthening of the pound against the euro has been making uk goods more expensive - and so less attractive - for eu customers .
in trade with non-eu countries in april , the value of exports and imports were both 0.5 % higher .
financial markets showed little reaction to the data .

mr cottle - who grew genetically-modified fodder maize in his fields at sealand last year - has so far refused to bow to pressure from environmentalists and politicians .
but assembly rural affairs minister carwyn jones met with mr cottle last friday to press for an end to the trials - two weeks after the seed was planted .
mr jones wants to create a " gm-free wales " , which some experts believe could kick-start wales 's flagging farming industry .
two separate gm trials that were planned at mathry in pembrokeshire , west wales , were called off when landowner tony marlow accused the government of providing misleading details on the experiment .
protesters at mathry , backed by mp jackie lawrence , took their case to environment minister michael meacher .
full debate now attention has switched to mr cottle , who has consistently advocated the benefits of conducting the trials .
the farmer had earlier resisted calls from assembly agriculture committee chairman glyn davies to abandon the government-backed scheme .
the assembly has said it wants mr cottle to remove the seed from his fields for the time being in order for the gm issue to be fully debated .
north wales am tom middlehurst has also discussed cancelling the trials with mr cottle .
scientific studies carried out on behalf of the assembly failed to give welsh agriculture minister carwyn jones the proof he needed to ban the gm crops .

to her millions of followers across the country she is an idol , a leader whom they all but worship .
her indonesian democratic party of struggle , or pdip , won by far the largest number of votes in the last election two years ago - and yet she did not become president .
her party did not have an outright majority and she failed to broker any deals with the other political parties in the national assembly , the body which selects the new president .
but now it seems her time may have come .
wahid undermined as the country lurches from crisis to crisis , president wahid 's position has been eroded .
megawati is following in her father 's footsteps senior officials from megawati 's party such as heri achmadi believe her maternal , if not to say feudal approach to politics is exactly what indonesia needs right now .
" first of all , she is a politician " , he says .
" but she is also a mother with her attention on her followers , on the people and the people who work with her . "
he says that is what the country needs at a time when the majority of indonesians feel abandoned by the government .
family business megawati was born into the nation 's political elite .
her father , sukarno , led the country to independence from dutch colonial rule after world war ii and became its first president .
he is still revered as a charismatic national hero and that status has been automatically transferred to megawati .
she has a vision .
it 's a simple vision - it 's almost a ronald reagan-like vision - of a strong , united democratic indonesia and it about stops there .
but maybe that 's enough doug ramage , the asia foundation she clearly idolises him .
" he is very handsome " , she laughs .
she says , giggling , that sometimes she thinks she is not his daughter as she keeps falling in love with him .
analysts such as doug ramage of the asia foundation in jakarta believe she has taken her father completely as her role-model .
" megawati 's vision of indonesia is not appreciably different from her father 's " , he says .
" this is indonesia as a unified nation state , where , if anything , decentralisation is slowed down and very few concessions if any are given to separatists in irian jaya or in aceh - which could be a problem for her " .
but , he says , she is known for her integrity , for making a deal and sticking with it .
late arrival despite being a member of such a famous political family , megawati was propelled into the limelight by default .
only at the age of 40 did she reluctantly join the opposition to former president suharto 's authoritarian government .
there have been regular protests in jakarta but her family name soon ensured she became a symbol of popular resistance - so much so that in 1996 suharto tried to remove her as leader of the indonesian democratic party , provoking demonstrations in the capital .
his supporters attacked the party headquarters , leaving at least five dead and many others injured .
megawati was transformed into a national hero .
but since the downfall of president suharto in 1998 she has shown little initiative .
up to the job ?
she remains one of the country 's most popular politicians , but even as vice-president she has remained largely silent and aloof - the quintessential javanese princess .
her critics say she is more interested in shopping and driving her favourite volkswagen beetle than the affairs of state .
she does n't seem to be on top of major economic issues , even political issues harold crouch , international crisis group harold crouch of the international crisis group in jakarta believes she is very limited intellectually : " the other day she was giving a speech in which she was criticising the autonomy laws and she did n't seem to be able to comprehend the idea that you can have state governments within a unitary state " , he says .
" the concept of federalism is not a difficult concept to grasp , but she does n't seem to have a grasp of it . "
even some members of her own party , such as jacob tobing , give less than convincing answers about why she should now become president .
" for one thing , she is there - we do not have an alternative " , he says .
" but she is better than the others , she 's a good listener , a team player , and she can do things through other people 's effort . "
if she does take power later this year , it will be critical she appoints a strong team around her .
otherwise the political stability the country so urgently needs will not be achieved .
