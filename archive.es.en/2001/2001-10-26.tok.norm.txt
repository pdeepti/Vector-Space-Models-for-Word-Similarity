it also highlighted a wide variety in the rate of caesarean births throughout the uk .
caesarean rates england and wales - 21.5 % north eastern - 19.3 % north western - 19.6 % east midlands - 20.4 % west midlands - 21.8 % eastern - 21.4 % london - 24.2 % south east - 22.6 % south west - 19.4 % wales - 24.2 % northern ireland - 23.9 % the study , carried out by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists on behalf of the department of health , involved an audit of every maternity unit in england and wales over a three-month period between may and july of this year .
guidelines the results will be used by the national institute of clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- to devise clinical guidelines on caesarean deliveries and to develop the national service framework for children .
thirty years ago just 3 % of babies were born by caesarean section in the uk .
the world health organisation recommends a caesarean rate of between 10 % and 15 % .
of all caesareans carried out in england and wales the main reasons included fetal distress -lrb- 22 % -rrb- , lack of progression during labour -lrb- 20 % -rrb- , previous caesarean -lrb- 14 % -rrb- and a breech baby -lrb- 11 % -rrb- .
more than 60 % of all caesarean sections carried out in england and wales were classed as an emergency procedure .
if you have major abdominal surgery there can be complications mary newburn up to 7 % of all caesareans were performed for no specific medical reason , so raising fears that many women are opting for the surgical procedure to fit in with busy lifestyles .
health minister jacqui smith welcomed the report : " the audit shows that there are significant variations in the caesarean section rate in different parts of the country and among different sections of the population .
" some of these variations may be due to women having more choice about their maternity care and childbirth but many are too great to be explained by choice alone and we need to know more .
" the next stage of the research will look at why these variations exist and will assess the best way to tackle inequalities in the system . "
' informed decisions ' obstetricians are concerned at the high rate of caesareans and want to raise awareness among women about the risks .
mary newburn warned of the dangers of c-sections professor bill dunlop , president of the royal college of obstetricians , said : " we know the caesarean rate has been on the increase over the last decade and we all need to understand the implications of this .
" women , midwives and doctors still need more information about the chance of complications arising from this major abdominal surgery so that women can make informed decisions about their delivery . "
complications include hysterectomy , post-natal depression and even death .
other factors contributing to the high increase in the number of caesarean births included the size of the hospital , the availability of a neo-natal intensive care unit and the number of midwives on duty .
the audit showed that while the majority of units provided one midwife per woman in labour , in 5 % of units only one midwife was allocated for up to three women .
earlier this year the royal college of nursing -lrb- rcn -rrb- called for the number of caesarean births to be cut , after it was revealed that in some uk hospitals the rate of caesarean births was as high as 40 % .
complicated the national childbirth trust -lrb- nct -rrb- , which participated in the study , believes the reasons for the increase in the number of caesarean births are complicated .
but belinda phipps , chief executive of the nct , said there was no evidence to suggest that a caesarean section rate above 8 % did anything more for neo-natal survival .
her colleague mary newburn said : " having a caesarean section does not mean a painfree birth .
" one of the things that is often said is that if you have a vaginal birth you have the pain before the baby , and if you surgery you have the pain afterwards .
" if you have major abdominal surgery there can be complications , and that is not something that people should discount lightly .

the british animal protection charity is looking to save millions of pounds over the next three years by ripping out its old communications system and installing a state-of-the-art replacement .
the rspca said a change was needed to help it cope with the two million enquiries - many of them emergencies - it gets annually .
the new communications system has been installed first at the rspca 's new headquarters in horsham , sussex , and soon regional offices will be updated too .
saving lives every 20 seconds someone calls the rspca for advice , help or to tell the charity about animals that are suffering or are being abused .
to help it tune its response to all these enquiries , the rspca is swapping its old voice communications and computer network for a system that routes everything over a network built around the internet 's data-handling protocol .
by converting everything into data and running it across one network , the rspca estimates that it will save up to Â£ 2 million pounds over the next three to five years .
as well as saving money the new network will help the charity do a better job of labelling each enquiry and organising an appropriate response .
faster response emergencies that need responding to quickly will be automatically routed to the right staff and centre so they can be dealt with faster .
the new network will also give rspca offices better access to information about potential homes for abandoned animals or those recovering from abuse .
a spokesman for the rspca said the end result should be fewer animals put to sleep because a home could not be found for them .
the rspca is the world 's oldest animal protection charity and was established in 1824 .
it employs 1,500 people across its head office , 10 regional offices , 23 animal homes , and four hospitals .
cable and wireless is working with the rspca to complete the technology project .

last week , a lego representative went to new zealand to meet with the maori , who had complained at lego 's use of maori words in its bionicle game .
after deciding to stop using offending words in any further launches of the bionicle range , lego now wants to set out a code of conduct for the use of traditional knowledge in the manufacture of toys .
bionicle involves a group of imaginary inhabitants of the island of mata nui , called the tohunga , who are in the power of an evil beast called makuta .
six heroes called the toa are sworn to liberate the tohunga .
positive feeling the meeting in new zealand , the first of its kind for lego , was to start discussions about the proposed code of conduct .
" we wanted to make sure the maori people would be interested in participating in such a process , " said brian soerenson , the lego representative at the new zealand meeting .
" i felt it was a very positive meeting , both on the code of conduct issue and also in the more broad discussions of the possibilities of co-operation in the future , but there has been no decision on this matter yet . "
maui solomon , the lawyer who wrote the original letter of complaint to lego , thinks the meeting was a step forward .
" we 're trying to put the record straight about the culture and here 's a major international company that 's out there projecting a different perception and image , " said mr solomon .
" now , if we can get that right , then you 've got something really powerful that 's going to satisfy the commercial market and more importantly , the cultural market . "
' menagerie of toys ' mr solomon and the groups he represents objected to the inappropriate use of maori words , and the way the game mixed together strands of many cultures .
" this was what lego was doing , taking bits and pieces and sticking it all together to make a bit of a menagerie of toys , which projected what they saw as sort of wonderful kind of culture of good versus evil , " mr solomon said .
removing maori culture entirely from the international toy market is not the new zealand group 's aim .
" we would want to have a code of conduct ; we know that other indigenous people around the world would want to have a code of conduct , " said roma hippolite , the chief executive officer of ngati koata trust , one of the groups at the lego meeting .
" it 's not to protect and isolate but just to make sure that appropriate recognition is given where due . "
having maori culture represented correctly could be a powerful tool for maori , according to mr hippolite .
" if an agreement can be made and the stories and the names are used appropriately so you could n't put the name tohunga -lsb- a spiritual advisor and healer -rsb- where it did n't belong , then there can be a whole generation of kids around the world that get to know and understand about things maori .
