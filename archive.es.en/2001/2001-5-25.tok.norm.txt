almost 700 people were dancing on the third floor of the versailles ballroom in west jerusalem .
the time was about 2245 local time -lrb- 1945 gmt -rrb- and it was a traditional evening to remember .
then tragedy struck .
" we were eating the hors d 'oeuvre when i saw the bride 's father , who was dancing , suddenly disappear " , said sarah pinhas , a relative of the groom .
" there was a huge noise and the floor suddenly opened up , creating a huge hole , " she said .
" i was lucky , as our table was in a corner where the floor held on . "
wedding guest shossi shemesh said : " i heard a huge noise ...
i thought the disc jockey was playing a joke on us , and suddenly , i found myself three floors lower , " she told israel 's first television channel .
the centre of the top floor had collapsed suddenly , witnesses said , sending the concrete crashing through the floors below .
the fall left a gaping , three-story hole with metal reinforcement cables hanging at twisted angles from the sides .
many had fallen to their deaths .
more were injured - many seriously .
and it was possible at least a hundred may be trapped below the huge piles of rubble .
the immediate assumption inside was that a bomb had gone off .
outside too the assumption was that terrorists had struck .
israel is well equipped for just such a catastrophe and within minutes emergency crews began arriving on the scene .
survivors as reports started filtering through , the chief of intelligence police for israel , david tzuri , said the collapse was due to an engineering failure and ruled out the possibility of a bomb attack .
immediately after the collapse , israel radio reported that a convoy of ambulances was heading to jerusalem from other parts of the country .
meanwhile inside the building survivors were doing whatever they could .
amir weiss said : " i was dancing when i felt the floor collapsing .
but together with my wife and a dozen guests , i managed to cling on to a pillar .
" we tied table cloths together , and we reached a safe point , five to 10 metres lower down .
the rescuers arrived later to rescue us with ladders . "
police and rescue workers had trouble containing the hundreds of bystanders .
rescue workers had to shout at the crowd to move out of the way as they tried to evacuate the injured to jerusalem 's three main hospitals .
lights out with a serious danger of another part of the building collapsing , the workers were unable to use heavy machinery and were obliged to work by hand .
just over an hour after the accident , the building 's blue neon lights went out , making operations even more complicated .
many of the rescuers were wearing helmets with miners ' lamps , in an attempt to save what was now thought to be about one hundred people still trapped under the rubble .
arih danon , who went into the building , described the ballroom : " i could see the rescue workers attaching drips to the victims , but the victims were hidden . "
three hours after the tragedy , the scene was still one of total chaos , as more people gathered around the building , which by then had a huge hole in its side .
mobile phones dozens of injured had been taken on stretchers , and sniffer dogs were brought in to find some more survivors under the debris .
police chief david tzuri said : " we have no idea how many are still buried . "
he said some of those trapped had used mobile phones to tell relatives they were still alive .
meanwhile the hospitals and community centres were filling up .
missing flecked with blood and caked in dust , an elderly israeli man sat alone in a corner where police were informing families of the names of injured people who survived .
" i am looking for my wife .
she may be hurt , " he said .
the grey-haired survivor was joined by his son and the two of them sat quietly .
suddenly one of the workers called out a family name , which matched the man 's own .
he and his son leapt up , shouting her first name joyously .
by cruel coincidence , it was not her .
she was still missing .

local residents say government policy has made the border crossing far more dangerous .

in a pilot scheme , 24 captive-bred voles are being released at the london wetland centre -lrb- lwc -rrb- .
they are the first of several hundred which will be set free to live in the centre 's reedbeds .
and they will be closely monitored to see if voles can be reintroduced elsewhere in the uk .
the vole was immortalised in the fictional person of ratty , the water rat in kenneth grahame 's book the wind in the willows , published a century ago .
steep decline in fact , rats have protruding ears , pointed noses and almost hairless tails , while water voles have small ears , blunt noses and furry tails , and are shorter and rounder than rats .
conservationists say the number of voles in the uk has fallen by 90 % in the last decade , mainly because of the destruction of their riverside habitat and the spread of one of their main predators , the mink .
tracking the new releases four organisations are working together to try to restore the voles to areas where they once thrived .
the four are the environment agency , mammals trust uk , oxford university 's wildlife conservation research unit , and the wildfowl and wetlands trust , owners of the lwc .
the 24 water voles being released over the next few days were born and bred at the wildwood discovery park in kent .
it breeds other endangered species for eventual release , including red squirrels , sand lizards , dormice , wild cats , pine martens and beavers .
the park 's kathy holder told bbc news online : " voles are n't difficult to breed .
we really just leave them to it .
" they have up to four litters a year , with from four to six young in each litter .
we have 30 breeding pairs , so we 'll soon have plenty of voles . "
the first batch to come to the lwc will be put in acclimatisation cages placed near the centre 's reedbeds .
they are expected to leave the cages within a few days and to dig themselves proper burrows .
heron alert they will be fitted with radio collars , and researchers will monitor their movements for several hours each day , seeing what sort of areas they choose .
their findings will help with future releases .
there is nothing to stop the voles leaving the centre 's grounds , though everyone hopes they will stay put .
martin senior of the lwc told bbc news online : " we do n't think they will disperse .
the thames flows nearby , but its banks are not suitable for burrowing .
" this is a mink-free environment , though there are herons and foxes , both of which also prey on voles . "
voles cling on in south-east england over the next few weeks many more voles will be released at the lwc , making a total for the scheme of 250 animals or more .
after that there are hopes of reintroducing the animals to other parts of south-east england where they were once abundant .
alastair driver , of the environment agency , told bbc news online : " because we restore a lot of habitats , we 're keen to see the species that belong there reintroduced .
implacable mink " i 'd like to see water voles come back to urban and suburban areas where they lived before , and to the wider countryside .
" but the mink are the limiting factor , and controlling them is labour-intensive .
" i do n't think it 's worth trying to bring the voles back except to reserves , or to specific river catchments where the mink are under control . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- car insurance set to soar low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's andrew verity " even the cheapest deals are set to rise sharply " real 56k friday , 25 may , 2001 , 05:50 gmt 06:50 uk car insurance set to soar insurance premiums are set to rise by Â£ 100 this year the cost of car insurance is predicted to rise by up to a quarter in the coming year .
business information group datamonitor says insurance companies are losing money and as a result will raise their premiums to return to profit .
figures show there has already been a 20 % increase in the past 12 months , adding Â£ 100 onto the average premium .
over the next year premiums are expected to go up by the same amount again .
a rise in the number of accident victims taking insurance companies to court and high administration costs have been blamed for the increase .
penalised datamonitor says much of the rise is due to " huge " underwriting losses , meaning that many firms now need to generate cash quickly .
although such losses dropped to Â£ 1.31bn in 1999 from Â£ 1.47bn the previous year , it said the sum was " still considerable " .
the cost of claims has also continued to rise , standing at Â£ 6.6bn in 1999 compared with Â£ 5bn four years earlier .
the average cost of a claim increased during the nineties , from Â£ 1,082 in 1993 to Â£ 1,580 in 1999 .
on a pound-for-pound basis , third party policyholders are likely to continue to be penalised as insurers look to get more customers to opt for fully comprehensive cover .
competition but datamonitor predicts there will still be competition for customers , as figures showed consumers are twice as likely to switch motor insurers than change their household insurance provider .
traditional companies also face a threat from new quarters such as supermarkets , which are becoming a growing force in the insurance market .

business information group datamonitor says insurance companies are losing money and as a result will raise their premiums to return to profit .
figures show there has already been a 20 % increase in the past 12 months , adding Â£ 100 onto the average premium .
over the next year premiums are expected to go up by the same amount again .
a rise in the number of accident victims taking insurance companies to court and high administration costs have been blamed for the increase .
penalised datamonitor says much of the rise is due to " huge " underwriting losses , meaning that many firms now need to generate cash quickly .
although such losses dropped to Â£ 1.31bn in 1999 from Â£ 1.47bn the previous year , it said the sum was " still considerable " .
the cost of claims has also continued to rise , standing at Â£ 6.6bn in 1999 compared with Â£ 5bn four years earlier .
the average cost of a claim increased during the nineties , from Â£ 1,082 in 1993 to Â£ 1,580 in 1999 .
on a pound-for-pound basis , third party policyholders are likely to continue to be penalised as insurers look to get more customers to opt for fully comprehensive cover .
competition but datamonitor predicts there will still be competition for customers , as figures showed consumers are twice as likely to switch motor insurers than change their household insurance provider .
traditional companies also face a threat from new quarters such as supermarkets , which are becoming a growing force in the insurance market .
aa insurance said datamonitor 's findings were largely in line with its own predictions that there will be a 20 % rise in policies over the current year , adding an average of Â£ 100 to each policy by next january .
its premium index shows that the average cost of a fully comprehensive policy rose from Â£ 363.85 in january 1995 to Â£ 602.53 at the start of this year .

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- Â£ 1m to clear cardiac case backlog low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo friday , 25 may , 2001 , 06:13 gmt 07:13 uk Â£ 1m to clear cardiac case backlog wales has some of the worst heart problems in the uk an estimated Â£ 1m is needed if the two cardiac units in wales are to slash the time that patients have to wait for surgery .
earlier this month , the welsh assembly announced a Â£ 2m funding boost in an effort to ease waiting times - but now the body responsible for overseeing the problem has said that sum alone is not enough .
the specialised health services commission estimates that a total of 439 patients currently on waiting lists in mid and south wales need cardiac surgery within the next year .
that is the figure which has been set if hospitals are to meet the target of eliminating waits of over 12 months by march next year .
watchdogs ' concern almost 200 patients can be treated at morriston hospital in swansea and the university hospital of wales in cardiff .
the rest would have to be dealt with at london 's hammersmith hospital .
but there is concern from some health watchdogs that not all patients are being given the opportunity of choosing to go to london .
and they are also worried that in south wales patients are not being treated as quickly as they should - because managers are refusing to ring-fence beds specifically for heart patients .
offer refused last week , a welsh health trust turned down a donation thought to be worth Â£ 750,000 which could have paid for a cardiac unit in an area of wales with some of the worst heart problems .
the pontypridd and rhondda nhs trust turned down the offer of funding for the unit at the royal glamorgan hospital in llantrisant , south wales .
the undisclosed donor had wanted to give the money to provide heart treatment facilities - but the trust has said there were unacceptable conditions attached .
despite being based in rhondda cynon taff - one of the worst parts of wales for cardiac problems - the royal glamorgan does not have a specialist unit .
benefactor patients from the area are normally sent to cardiff or swansea - because it is nhs policy for specialist units to treat cardiac patients , rather than district general hospitals like the royal glamorgan .
the anonymous benefactor had insisted the money was used for a cardiac unit , capable of simple heart procedures .
and they are also worried that in south wales patients are not being treated as quickly as they should - because managers are refusing to ring-fence beds specifically for heart patients .
