the return to duty of 30 % of the police force was the first part of a deal reached with the authorities in exchange for the release of the two leaders of the police rebellion .
the police are demanding better pay the bbc 's correspondent in sao paulo says that the city is returning to normal more slowly than expected .
negotiations over police pay have not yet begun .
there are continuing reports of sporadic looting in outer suburbs and troops from other regions of brazil continue to be flown in to salvador , a popular tourist resort on the atlantic coast .
armed attacks in the past two days at least 60 shops have been looted , according to a local trade association .
witnesses say the attackers have been well organised and armed .
but a meeting that ended early on saturday brought the first breakthrough in the deadlock between the authorities and police negotiators .
in exchange for the release of the two main strike leaders and a promise to review the punishment of another 68 , the police agreed that 30 % of the force would return to duty .
another meeting will be held to discuss the pay demands and try to end the strike altogether .
domino effect " we understand that we need to put police back on the streets , not for the governor , but for the people of bahia , " said isidoro de santana , one of the police officers who was released .
some brazilian offficials are now concerned that the strike could have a domino effect .
in the capital , brasilia , police spokesmen say they will also go on strike if their pay demands are not met soon .
in sao paulo , police have begun a campaign for higher pay , although at the moment it is peaceful .
police wages are traditionally very low in brazil and this is seen by many as one of the main causes of widespread police corruption and brutality .

while the indian media focussed on the pakistani president 's approach to the summit and his body language , pakistani newspapers wrote about the warmth with which their leader was received .
while day one was seen as more symbolic than substantive - with the main discussions scheduled for sunday - indian dailes felt that there was hope that the summit would be positive .
" the first round of consultations between the indian leaders and general musharraf ... helped clear the air , " the hindu wrote in its lead article .
" while a political breakthrough in bilateral relations may remain elusive at agra , the prospect for a productive summit appear to have improved , " it said .
tension eases the asian age wrote that president musharraf and prime minister vajpayee were visibly tense when they first met , shaking hands without looking into each other 's eyes .
the sceptics who had been predicting a doomed summit changed their view the asian age but , it said , the atmosphere lightened by the afternoon , when the two leaders warmed to each other over lunch .
" this is the spirit that will now guide the summit , " the asian age said .
" the sceptics who had been predicting a doomed summit changed their view . "
this assessment was echoed by the hindustan times .
" musharraf appeared to be in unfamiliar territory upon his arrival : he hardly smiled , his handshakes appeared to lack warmth ; and he appeared to acknowledge people with what looked looked like a cross between a salute and a wave .

the indian express wrote that the pakistani president raised the curtains on the agra summit by taking centre stage instead of standing in the wings .
" from that of a determined general to a confident ceo , from an image-conscious politician to a bargainer who knows how to soft-sell his hard talk .
" leaving behind , for a suspicious and sceptical nation , the impression of a character who knows what to ask for as he walks into the make-or-break act tomorrow , " the express said .
fresh approach the pakistani dailies also felt that day one had gone well as the president was warmly received and the hostile rhetoric of the past week had given way to more congenial statements .
president musharraf said he would consider his mission in india reasonably successful if he could get prime minister vajpayee to simply initiate a structured dialogue on kashmir dawn the news said that pakistan and india indicated they would try fresh approaches to resolve their outstanding disputes .
" president pervez musharraf and prime minister atal behari vajpayee met several times informally , began to know each other and started preparing for their structured summit in agra , expected to produce at least one agreement on sunday , to meet again . "
it said , however , that the two sides remained as inflexible on the core issue of kashmir , as they were before , with no visible sign that any side was willing to give up anything , at least publicly .
the karachi-based dawn newspaper focussed on president musharraf 's 25-minute closed door meeting with kashmiri separatist leaders , where he pledged his continued political and moral support to them .
" president musharraf said he would consider his mission in india reasonably successful if he could get prime minister vajpayee to simply initiate a structured dialogue on kashmir , thereby recognising it as a key issue dogging the two countries , " it said .
the nation also referred to the president 's emphasis on the importance of settling the kashmir issue for peace and prosperity in south asia .
by doing so he was addressing pakistan 's core concern , " at the same time conceding the relevance of points rasied by mr vajpayee on friday concerning burying the past , building a new relationship of trust and the need to discuss a whole range of subjects which could dispel suspicion and contribute to peace " , it said .

whether this will alter the nature of the regime in china with its widely condemned human rights record is open to question .
democracy , human rights .
they 're not the main issue .
there is something far more important here .
the world is embracing us , china li , a philosophy student the most immediate impact so far has been to unleash a wave of unprecedented celebrations in china .
" what 's the plan for the rest of the evening ? "
i asked the student of transportation with a skin problem .
" when we win , there will be a big party . "
when we win .
at the millennium altar in the heart of the capital - a giant monument built for giant public events that looks like an overturned saucer - the crowd seemed to think that the beijing olympics were a foregone conclusion .
thank god they did win .
the student carried on waving his red flag and singing that old favourite , " i love my red banner with its five stars " .
adulation in tiananmen square thousands have converged without having been told to do so by the regime - the first unscripted mass gathering for over ten years .
this time the students were not demonstrating ; they were doing the conga .
genuine spontaneity in china is a rare thing .
it can also be scary .
some of the same people who had ordered the 1989 massacre could be seen soaking up the adulation of the jubilant masses .
li-peng , the former prime minister , who was instrumental in the crackdown , could now be seen grinning from ear to ear .
the olympic games will help to erase the unpleasant memory of events in the square below .
nationalist fever and , of course , president jiang zemin , so overjoyed about the thumbs-up from the ioc , seemed to be on the point of spontaneous combustion .
the only glum face was today 's prime minister , zhu rongji , a sceptic and a reformer , who has recently fallen into some disfavour .
he looked ashen-faced and deeply perplexed .
why , i wondered .
perhaps he thought : " now that we 've created this nationalist fever , what are we going to do with it ? "
jiang zemin and the party have spent the last few years nurturing the alternative religion of nationalism - over taiwan , over tibet , over american spy planes .
and they could see the fruits of their labour .
tens of thousands of citizens , young and old , crying hysterically that china was finally going to ... well ... host a sports event .
this was genuine olympic fever .
the bid for the games was not just a question of a capital city hosting some athletics , and no one here whinged about money or disruption to traffic as they did in sydney .
continuous history this was a matter of national honour , of china finally being recognised by the rest of the world - for its size , for its spectacular growth , for its potential .
and as we kept being told over and over again , for its 4,000 - or was it 5,000 ? - years of continuous history .
by the way , much of that continuous history has been flattened in recent years to make way for olympian shopping malls , hotels and spaghetti junctions .
when atlanta , sydney or athens bid for the games , everyone talked about the cities .
but this time they talked about the nation .
unchannelled emotions li , a frighteningly articulate 19-year old philosophy student , came up to me .
" democracy , human rights .
they 're not the main issue .
there is something far more important here .
the world is embracing us , china , " he said .
his geeky friends cheered hysterically .
a pretty young girl kissed him on the cheek .
he blushed .
more answers like this and he might get lucky , i thought .
clearly inspired , another young man approached me .
" i hope that now we have the olympics , you 'll report more objectively about us , " he said .
i felt like punching him .
there is a lot of anger , resentment and excess energy in china that has nowhere to go .
the regime is forever trying to channel these emotions , rather like an old-fashioned pe teacher at a boarding school who tries to diffuse the ructions of puberty with endless physical exercise .
more democracy ?
there has been a whiff of mass mobilisation about the olympic bid : the new fitness parks on the pavements of beijing ; the collective rope skip involving 2,008 children ; the campaign to teach taxi drivers english and make them less surly ; and the mass mobilisation of good manners .
i have no doubt that beijing will host a dazzling olympics .
but will the games make the country more democratic ?
i seriously doubt it .
if anything , they will be used by the authorities as an excuse to stamp out unseemly opposition to save face .
but china is also a volatile country .
moods can swing suddenly without warning .
our translator pointed out that the patriotic songs sung by the near-hysterical students at the millennium altar were the very same ones sung in tiananmen square in 1989 before the tanks moved in .
those demonstrators also thought they were being patriotic by calling for change .
the regime disagreed .
no wonder then that thousands of police and public security officials looked on nervously as the city cheered with tears in its eyes .

whether this will alter the nature of the regime in china with its widely condemned human rights record is open to question .
democracy , human rights .
they 're not the main issue .
there is something far more important here .
the world is embracing us , china li , a philosophy student the most immediate impact so far has been to unleash a wave of unprecedented celebrations in china .
" what 's the plan for the rest of the evening ? "
i asked the student of transportation with a skin problem .
" when we win , there will be a big party . "
when we win .
at the millennium altar in the heart of the capital - a giant monument built for giant public events that looks like an overturned saucer - the crowd seemed to think that the beijing olympics were a foregone conclusion .
thank god they did win .
the student carried on waving his red flag and singing that old favourite , " i love my red banner with its five stars " .
adulation in tiananmen square thousands have converged without having been told to do so by the regime - the first unscripted mass gathering for over ten years .
this time the students were not demonstrating ; they were doing the conga .
the games should erase the unpleasant memory of tiananmen square events genuine spontaneity in china is a rare thing .
it can also be scary .
some of the same people who had ordered the 1989 massacre could be seen soaking up the adulation of the jubilant masses .
li-peng , the former prime minister , who was instrumental in the crackdown , could now be seen grinning from ear to ear .
the olympic games will help to erase the unpleasant memory of events in the square below .
nationalist fever and , of course , president jiang zemin , so overjoyed about the thumbs-up from the ioc , seemed to be on the point of spontaneous combustion .
the only glum face was today 's prime minister , zhu rongji , a sceptic and a reformer , who has recently fallen into some disfavour .
he looked ashen-faced and deeply perplexed .
why , i wondered .
there has been a whiff of mass mobilisation for the olympic bid perhaps he thought : " now that we 've created this nationalist fever , what are we going to do with it ? "
jiang zemin and the party have spent the last few years nurturing the alternative religion of nationalism - over taiwan , over tibet , over american spy planes .
and they could see the fruits of their labour .
tens of thousands of citizens , young and old , crying hysterically that china was finally going to ... well ... host a sports event .
this was genuine olympic fever .
the bid for the games was not just a question of a capital city hosting some athletics , and no one here whinged about money or disruption to traffic as they did in sydney .
continuous history this was a matter of national honour , of china finally being recognised by the rest of the world - for its size , for its spectacular growth , for its potential .
and as we kept being told over and over again , for its 4,000 - or was it 5,000 ? - years of continuous history .
by the way , much of that continuous history has been flattened in recent years to make way for olympian shopping malls , hotels and spaghetti junctions .
when atlanta , sydney or athens bid for the games , everyone talked about the cities .
but this time they talked about the nation .
unchannelled emotions li , a frighteningly articulate 19-year old philosophy student , came up to me .
" democracy , human rights .
they 're not the main issue .
there is something far more important here .
the world is embracing us , china , " he said .
hosting the olympics was a matter of national honour his geeky friends cheered hysterically .
a pretty young girl kissed him on the cheek .
he blushed .
more answers like this and he might get lucky , i thought .
clearly inspired , another young man approached me .
" i hope that now we have the olympics , you 'll report more objectively about us , " he said .
i felt like punching him .
there is a lot of anger , resentment and excess energy in china that has nowhere to go .
the regime is forever trying to channel these emotions , rather like an old-fashioned pe teacher at a boarding school who tries to diffuse the ructions of puberty with endless physical exercise .
more democracy ?
there has been a whiff of mass mobilisation about the olympic bid : the new fitness parks on the pavements of beijing ; the collective rope skip involving 2,008 children ; the campaign to teach taxi drivers english and make them less surly ; and the mass mobilisation of good manners .
i have no doubt that beijing will host a dazzling olympics .
but will the games make the country more democratic ?
i seriously doubt it .
if anything , they will be used by the authorities as an excuse to stamp out unseemly opposition to save face .
but china is also a volatile country .
moods can swing suddenly without warning .
our translator pointed out that the patriotic songs sung by the near-hysterical students at the millennium altar were the very same ones sung in tiananmen square in 1989 before the tanks moved in .
those demonstrators also thought they were being patriotic by calling for change .
the regime disagreed .
no wonder then that thousands of police and public security officials looked on nervously as the city cheered with tears in its eyes .
