both sides called the fourth annual eu-china summit successful and productive .
but the chinese premier dismissed eu concerns about human rights as unfounded .
zhu rongji arrived in brussels flanked by a 135-strong delegation of ministers and officials , evidence he said of the importance of china 's relationship with the eu .
the meeting with the eu 's top officials and the prime minister of belgium focused on deepening trade links and smoothing the way for china 's membership of the world trade organisation in three month 's time .
' worsening situation ' but the eu also called for improvements to what campaigners say is a worsening human rights situation in recent months ; top of their concerns were allegations of state-sanctioned violence against religious minorities like the falun gong spiritual movement , a record number of executions and the treatment of refugees from north korea .
after the meeting , china 's prime minister said that the chinese human rights situation was at its best and getting better every day .
he said accusations that the government had breached international human rights were unfounded .
however , in a joint written statement after the meeting , both sides said that the dialogue on human rights will continue with another meeting due later this year .

in exchange the companies would broadcast chinese state-owned english-language channel , cctv-9 , in the us , a broadcasting authority spokeswoman said wednesday .
" americans want to come in .
we of course want to go there too ... it should be mutually beneficial , " the spokeswoman for the state administration of radio , television and film said .
if a deal is agreed , it would be the first time a foreign broadcast has been allowed to transmit directly into china .
the firms would be allowed to broadcast into a restricted area of guangdong , a prosperous province next to hong kong , she said but added that no timetable had been set .
however , if a deal goes through analysts believe that bringing cctv to the us would be a regulatory and political challenge .
personal triumph news of the chinese talks has been interpreted as a personal triumph for rupert murdoch who has repeatedly tried to break into that country 's television market .

" we are hopeful we can reach a positive conclusion soon and launch a new service that complements our already substantial operations in china , " james murdoch , chairman and chief executive of hong-kong based star said .
under the current complicated rules , both companies already have a presence in the market .
some observers say that the fact that some foreign television distributors have already made inroads into the chinese market may have encouraged the authorities there to change their approach .
" instead of trying to block all of this stuff , they will regulate and approve a certain amount of it , " the financial times ' beijing correspondent james kynge told the bbc 's world business report .
' symbolic move ' the deal is potentially highly lucrative , given that the chinese television advertising market is estimated to be worth about $ 2.4bn -lrb- £ 1.6bn -rrb- .
already china has 90 million cable subscribers .
but analysts warn that it may be years before the two companies can reap profits from china .

reports on thursday suggested that a ban had been implemented because matsushita referred to taiwan as an independent country .
a senior official at the ministry of information industry has disputed the ban in the official china daily newspaper , though admitted that a ban had been considered .
the government complained about the handsets displaying " roc " , the abbreviation for republic of china , when calling taiwan , which considers it a renegade province .
the ban would not have had a serious impact on the company 's profits because china 's mobile phone market is still developing , but the firm admitted on thursday to be worried about the future impact of a 12 month penalty .
" china will soon become the world 's biggest market for mobile phones so it -lrb- the ban -rrb- could have an impact -lrb- on profits -rrb- , " a spokesman said .
in august , mci said it was recalling mobile phones in china because of their reference to taiwan as roc .
japan 's largest mobile phone maker said on thursday it was calling back four panasonic models - gd50 , gd90 , gd92 and gd93 - to rewrite their software .
it did not say how many handsets would be affected .
the chinese subsidiary of matsushita will continue to make phones at its factories in china to be sold overseas .
mci sold about a million mobile handsets in china in the year to march and had been trying to boost output for an expected explosion of demand .
matsushita loss meanwhile , speculation has heightened that matsushita electric would report a major loss in the financial year to march 2002 , due to a global slump in demand for mobile phones and computers .
" we posted a big loss in the first quarter to june and things are not looking good for the rest of the year , " a spokesman said .
a report thursday warned the leading consumer electronics firm would incur 100bn yen -lrb- $ 840m -rrb- loss to march 2002 .
that follows it reporting its first ever loss last quarter since listing on the stock market 33 years ago .
the company 's commitments to a early retirement plan and the restructuring of its manufacturing plants would be responsible , the nihon keizai newspaper said .
