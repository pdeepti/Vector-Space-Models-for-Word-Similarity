the forest sector has long been one of canada 's economic mainstays - particularly in the western forests of british columbia .
but the industry has been stumbling in recent months and along with it have fallen the fortunes of many small towns and tens of thousands of jobs .
the problems are many and the situation in canada 's woods may get worse before it gets better .
trade dispute there is an eerie silence along the gravel road in a forest north of vancouver .
i do n't know where we 're going now charles widman , industry analyst there should be huge articulated trucks rumbling along these roads , laden with thick fir and cedar logs .
but today the only thing moving is a bird rummaging in a puddle .
it is like this across much of british columbia these days .
industry profits have withered , mills have closed , employment has fallen and whole communities have lost their economic base .
the most immediate problem is a long-running trade dispute between canada and america .
the us is canada 's largest customer for wood .
but the united states has its own timber industry and producers there have long complained that canada unfairly subsidises its lumber operations .
more bad news the canadians deny the charge , but earlier this year the us government imposed duties and penalties of up to 30 % on canadian wood .
it has hit the companies in canada very hard - some estimates blame the tariffs for 30,000 lost jobs .
talks between senior government officials from both countries have limped along in recent weeks , but it could be weeks yet before an agreement is reached .
charles widman , a senior forest industry analyst in vancouver , says the situation does not look very good .
" the offers that we 've made to change our forest practices have been rejected .
so i do n't know where we 're going now .
" i think it 's going to be well into 2002 before we reach a resolution and we are n't hopeful of an early resolution to this problem . "
worse news is that the lumber dispute with america is just one - and perhaps the most easily solved - of the problems facing the forest industry here .
tough decisions a new government report paints a grim picture of outdated equipment , too many lumber mills , and a massive infestation of beetles that are eating their way through prime trees .
charles widman agrees with much of that assessment .
it could be as much as a decade before the forest industry rumbles to life again " we 're going through a very difficult time .
the markets themselves have been low in north america for the past couple of years .
our overseas markets , like japan , have evaporated .
" we also have this mountain pine beetle which is the worst infestation in the history of bc .
so we 're going into 2002 with a lot of challenges in our platter . "
and meeting those challenges is going to require some very tough and unpopular decisions by both government and the industry .
mill closures , job losses and bankruptcies are widely seen as inevitable .
but if the reforms are made , most observers say the resulting industry could be stronger than ever .
they warn , however , it could be as much as a decade before the forest industry rumbles to life again along the back roads of british columbia .

latest official figures show that only one in 10 of those over 65 years old are online .
but for one elderly british woman , an early christmas present of a sony laptop from her stepson , computer consultant bill thompson , has opened up a whole new world .
i had never ever used a computer at all .
i was absolutely terrified of them aileen aldred " i found it easier than i expected and i was n't quite as terrified when i got it turned on , " 66-year-old aileen aldred told the bbc programme go digital .
" it was so beautiful when it was on , all i wanted to do was sit and look at it . "
' absolutely terrified ' as the uk government puts more services online and many companies increasingly rely on their online presence , they are leaving behind a whole generation who did not grow up with computers and regard them with awe and a little fear .
internet use in britain by age 16 to 24:87 % 25 to 44:69 & 45 to 54:58 % 55 to 64:37 % 65 and over : 11 % source : office of national statistics " i had never ever used a computer at all .
i was absolutely terrified of them , " said aileen .
she was shown how to use the laptop by her stepson bill thompson .
he found it a time-consuming process , but not because aileen was slow to learn .
" it was n't the training , that was fine , " he said .
" i turned the laptop on and i thought i 'll just set up all the software .
it took me three hours to get to the point that i felt comfortable with letting them use it .
" this is one of the big problems for anyone who is new to computers , " he explained .
" it 's not so much that using the web is hard , because it is n't .
it is that when you turn on your computer for the first time , there is so much stuff you have to do , it 's a real barrier . "
generation gap many elderly people see the internet and computers as a way of sharing points of interest with the younger generation .
sony vaio : early christmas present " the grandchildren seem to use them so easily just perhaps as i would use the telephone , " said aileen .
" they used it so easily that i thought maybe i could do that too .
" or at least i could keep up with them .
they were talking about things that i no idea of at all . "
like most pensioners who use the internet , aileen is concentrating on using it to keep in touch with friends and relatives .
" i 've actually done an e-mail to bill and it did take me a long while to do it .
i 'm going to try and do some more e-mails .
i 'm concentrating on that , " said aileen .
studies have shown that once the elderly discover the internet , most find it an empowering and liberating experience .
web horizons as her confidence builds , aileen aldred intends to branch out into the world of online shopping as this is something which is particularly attractive to people her age .
" i intend to get everything on file , such as all my menus , my addresses .
and i hope to do shopping because when you 're not quite as mobile as you used to be , i 'll still be able to shop . "
the number of elderly people in the uk using the internet is still vastly outnumbered by people in their twenties .
a combination of apprehension and cost tend to deter many .
over the last 12 months the number of silver surfers in the uk has grown by only 1 % .
aileen has some advice for people like her who may be scared by technology .

successful comebacks are not that common in pop music .
to jump a couple of pop generations and come back in a different genre is almost unheard of .
would i have known in the 70s it would be like this ?
no way rob davis but rob davis has done just that - and written two of the uk 's biggest dance anthems in the process , spiller 's groovejet -lrb- if this ai n't love -rrb- and kylie minogue 's ca n't get you out of my head .
few of the record-buyers who put them at the top of the charts would have been born when davis first hit the big time , as guitarist with 1970s glam-rockers mud .
rob davis told bbc news online how he approaches writing a dance smash .
" i might have a little chorus , maybe from sitting down with the guitar , and i 'm thinking i can adapt it to a dance thing .
" or - especially if i 'm co-writing - i 'll set up some grooves and maybe some chord changes .
" most people like very simple chord changes for dance , so you might set up a simple bass line and then get a vocal and add other parts later . "
ca n't get you out of my head was co-written with cathy dennis - a challenging partner , says davis .
" if i 'm writing with someone like cathy , she 's very musical , so she would n't like a dance track to be all set up - she 'd like to be able to change a chord here and there . "
the smash hit for kylie kept posh spice out of the top spot - just as groovejet -lrb- if this ai n't love -rrb- did in 2000 .
davis laughs at the suggestion he has something against the former spice girl : " i 've nothing against posh , it 's just coincidence .
" i 've got no control over release dates - and who knows what a record 's going to do before release ? "
becoming a hot dance producer and writer has been a long journey for davis , whose musical heroes were guitarists like jimi hendrix , larry carlton and 10cc 's eric stewart .
" would i have known in the 70s it would be like this ?
no way , " he admits .
" i think in the 70s dance was a mile off , but even in the mid-to-late 70s i was always into black music like the isley brothers , and jazz-rock things like steely dan .
' melody ' " but i met paul oakenfold in about 1988 and he said to me , ' i know exactly where music is going to go , the house thing is going to be big ' - and he started playing me all these things .
" i thought i quite liked it , but it needed a bit more melody .
" then i saw an opening , to write top lines , melody lines to it , and get more vocals into the club tunes .
" because i got that from the mud days - i knew about vocal harmonies and the beach boys vibe , and i knew how to adapt that vibe to club music . "
it was with dj paul oakenfold that davis first made an impression on the dance scene , co-writing the dance hit jibaro for electra in 1988 .
' left of centre ' since then davis 's songs and productions have been released by fragma , grace , movement 98 and coco .
does he try to get the lyrics to tell a story , or just to feel right ?
" i try to get a bit of both , if i can - it 's good to have a little meaning in there .
" but with some really famous people , the production is so mega that it drives a really average song through , that 's the way it is nowadays .
" i try to start with something that 's strong - and it 's hard for a writer , you love something because it 's your latest thing and you have to get out of that mode and think a & r , think : is this original , is this going to stand up out there ? "
this notion of quality control may be the reason why artists are still queuing up to record his songs .
" there 's a rumour of sophie ellis-bextor doing a tune that i did in stockholm with the merlin team , who work with samantha mumba and others - apparently her a & r team really loves that .
" and i 'm doing something with atomic kitten , which is like an anastacia-type vocal . "
relaxation davis still stays in touch with the bandmates from mud , with whom he played for more than a decade from 1968 .
the exception is lead singer les grey , who lives in portugal and is very ill .
davis finds relaxation time rarer now , but he says picking up the guitar is still important .
" i still gig - work 's getting a bit mad now , and i think that after this christmas i 'm going to stop , but i still do little pub gigs down in surrey , where i live . "
" i love a sunday morning pub blues jam , all off the cuff - absolutely brilliant . "
