this will cut the price of bulk electricity and ultimately reduce electricity bills to domestic consumers .
savings of 10 % were anticipated when the decision to spend more than £ 100m to replace the often criticised electricity pool was made over three years ago .
the office of gas and electricity markets -lrb- ofgem -rrb- said prices have begun to fall already as traders have factored in neta 's arrival in advance .
wholesale electricity prices have fallen by 15 % ahead of neta 's launch , ofgem said .
supportive consumer group a consumer group that represents large business customers agrees and points to how prices in annual contracts bought by industrial consumers have fallen sharply .
the contracts are now 35 % cheaper than they were two years ago , despite a recent rise in generators ' fuel costs .
this is a result of more aggressive pricing in response to neta 's arrival , according to the electricity group chairman of the major energy users council , don mcgarrigle .
scepticism remains but others say it is not clear that the new £ 7.5bn power market will work as intended .
analysts acknowledge that prices have fallen in recent years , but they say this is because new companies have entered the uk electricity generation market .
" i really do n't think we are likely to see further significant price declines as a result of neta , " said simon harrison , a director with the energy consultancy mott macdonald .
some consumer groups have also criticised the new market because they believe its mechanism will allow big generators to manipulate prices .
small generators , supply companies and renewable energy providers such as wind farms will lose out , critics said .
expensive project in addition to the £ 100m spent by ofgem on the new electricity market , the industry itself has spent even more .
much of the money has gone towards developing software for trading systems , and delays in these areas have delayed the launch of the new market .
a successful launch ahead of a general election would be a boost to the ruling labour party .
but the government is also desperate to avoid another energy crisis in the wake of the fuel protests seen last autumn .
the uncertainty surrounding neta has meant that many firms have put off the renewal of their annual contracts to purchase a year 's supply of electricity .
such contracts often run from april to april in line with the tax year .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- uk troops to boost macedonian security low graphics version -pipe- feedback -pipe- help you are in : uk politics front page world uk uk politics interviews business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo the bbc 's peter biles in tetovo " tetovo is now largely quiet " real 28k the macedonian interior ministry 's stevo pendarovski " the situation is under control " real 28k tuesday , 27 march , 2001 , 06:48 gmt 07:48 uk uk troops to boost macedonian security more than 3,000 uk troops are serving in kosovo britain is sending an extra 120 troops to kosovo to help the authorities in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia overcome albanian rebels .
the move , announced by prime minister tony blair in the commons , came as the macedonians said they had successfully completed their military operation against rebels near the city of tetovo .
the single greatest danger is that what we prevented in kosovo then happens elsewhere tony blair the government said the rebels had been driven across the border into kosovo .
mr blair told mps british troops already based in kosovo would form a new 400-strong battle group alongside scandinavian soldiers to strengthen the border zone with macedonia .
the aim is to prevent the rebels returning across the border and stepping up the insurgency .
from next month the battle group will be enhanced with a unit of british unmanned phoenix reconnaissance ' drones ' , with 120 soldiers , to improve intelligence gathering capabilities .
mr blair made the announcement during a commons statement on the european union summit in stockholm , which issued a statement backing the macedonian government 's actions so far .
kosovo warning he told mps that " armed albanian extremists " must not be allowed to succeed in their aim of destabilising the macedonian state .
" macedonian has started to build a multi-ethnic society and it is in all our interests that the country succeeds and does n't polarise into separate slav and albanian communities . "
failure to protect macedonia 's borders could result in a carbon copy of the kosovo situation , mr blair warned .
earlier foreign secretary robin cook said : " i now hope that the message will get across to the terrorists that there is no support anywhere in europe for any attempt to re-draw boundaries in blood . "
but he stressed that the response of the macedonian government must be " proportionate " to the terrorist threat .
opposition backing opposition leader william hague welcomed the announcement and said he backed the government 's measures .
iain duncan smith , who speaks for the tories on defence , warned that the current situation in macedonia presented the " real test for the west " .
" there is a serious plan among albanian separatists to create what appears to be a sort of greater albania out of the bits of various countries around them . "
he said nato had " no other option " than the current course it was pursuing .
liberal democrat foreign affairs and defence spokesman menzies campbell said the operation was an opportunity for europe to prove it was " serious " about taking more responsibility for its own security .
but he warned that if it failed it would " undermine the argument that europe is capable of effective operations without the us presence " .
deployment details the new battle group , which will be commanded by a british officer , will mount " interdiction operations " along the border , with the aim of intercepting rebel albanian reinforcements and supplies .

the move , announced by prime minister tony blair in the commons , came as the macedonians said they had successfully completed their military operation against rebels near the city of tetovo .
the single greatest danger is that what we prevented in kosovo then happens elsewhere tony blair the government said the rebels had been driven across the border into kosovo .
mr blair told mps british troops already based in kosovo would form a new 400-strong battle group alongside scandinavian soldiers to strengthen the border zone with macedonia .
the aim is to prevent the rebels returning across the border and stepping up the insurgency .
from next month the battle group will be enhanced with a unit of british unmanned phoenix reconnaissance ' drones ' , with 120 soldiers , to improve intelligence gathering capabilities .
mr blair made the announcement during a commons statement on the european union summit in stockholm , which issued a statement backing the macedonian government 's actions so far .
kosovo warning he told mps that " armed albanian extremists " must not be allowed to succeed in their aim of destabilising the macedonian state .
" macedonian has started to build a multi-ethnic society and it is in all our interests that the country succeeds and does n't polarise into separate slav and albanian communities . "
failure to protect macedonia 's borders could result in a carbon copy of the kosovo situation , mr blair warned .
earlier foreign secretary robin cook said : " i now hope that the message will get across to the terrorists that there is no support anywhere in europe for any attempt to re-draw boundaries in blood . "
but he stressed that the response of the macedonian government must be " proportionate " to the terrorist threat .
opposition backing opposition leader william hague welcomed the announcement and said he backed the government 's measures .
iain duncan smith , who speaks for the tories on defence , warned that the current situation in macedonia presented the " real test for the west " .
" there is a serious plan among albanian separatists to create what appears to be a sort of greater albania out of the bits of various countries around them . "
he said nato had " no other option " than the current course it was pursuing .
liberal democrat foreign affairs and defence spokesman menzies campbell said the operation was an opportunity for europe to prove it was " serious " about taking more responsibility for its own security .
but he warned that if it failed it would " undermine the argument that europe is capable of effective operations without the us presence " .
deployment details the new battle group , which will be commanded by a british officer , will mount " interdiction operations " along the border , with the aim of intercepting rebel albanian reinforcements and supplies .
troops from the 2nd royal tank regiment and the 1st battalion , the duke of wellington 's regiment , are expected to start moving into position from tuesday .
the phoenix drones , operated by the royal artillery regiment , will use thermal imaging cameras to send back ' real time ' pictures of movements around the border zone to commanders on the ground .

over-investment in the purchase of 3g licences is blamed .
professor peter cochrane , until recently the head of technology at british telecom , has told the bbc that the new third-generation phones may never appear .
professor cochrane : a serious game of poker the professor is also concerned that some telecom companies may collapse under the financial strain of trying to develop and run the new networks .
" make no mistake about it , this is a fairly serious game of poker .
some people are betting everything on this technology , " he told the money programme , which is due to broadcast on wednesday .
" if they ca n't find a solution , i think we will see companies collapse . "
internet and video links third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phones offer broadband services , which include high-speed data transmission and internet and video links .
the phones are expected to revolutionise communications .
sophisticated handsets will be able to guide drivers through towns and cities , receive e-mail , or allow people to play computer games across the world .
european telecom companies have spent a collective £ 60bn on auctions to purchase 3g licences in countries across europe .
the licences allow the winning companies to build 3g networks and provide services to their local populations .
a ' study in madness ' professor cochrane , who was responsible for bt 's 3g research programme until november 2000 , said the auction process was " a really good study in madness " .
it was a bit like lemmings going over the edge of a cliff professor peter cochrane " it was a bit like lemmings going over the edge of a cliff , " he added .
in the uk , orange , bt , vodafone , and one2one and a consortium backed by hutchison whampoa paid out a combined total of £ 22bn to secure a uk licence .
yet more money will be spent on building the networks and developing new phones to handle the upgraded technology .
in the uk alone , it is estimated that 3g networks will need up to 28,000 new masts and base stations .
" i think europe has shot itself in the foot , and certainly the uk has , because i do n't think we are going to see 3g , " said the professor .
confident despite such negative sentiment , the telecom companies remain confident in public .
orange 's richard brennan told the money programme : " if we were to paint a picture of 3g , it would be a world where you have this remote control for life . "
bt is also upbeat about the future applications of 3g technology , as well as the financial rewards .
kent thexton from bt said in the programme : " now , 60 % of the uk population have found a way to put into their monthly expenditure their mobile phone bills ... and what we 're talking about is adding to that . "
city analysts , however , are more sceptical and some predict it could be 10 years before the telecom companies get their money back , if at all .
the money programme 's report " mobile madness " will be broadcast on wednesday , 28 march , at 1930 uk time -lrb- 1830 gmt -rrb- on bbc two .

over-investment in the purchase of 3g licences is blamed .
professor peter cochrane , until recently the head of technology at british telecom , has told the bbc that the new third-generation phones may never appear .
the professor is also concerned that some telecom companies may collapse under the financial strain of trying to develop and run the new networks .
" make no mistake about it , this is a fairly serious game of poker .
some people are betting everything on this technology , " he told the money programme , which is due to broadcast on wednesday .
" if they ca n't find a solution , i think we will see companies collapse . "
internet and video links third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phones offer broadband services , which include high-speed data transmission and internet and video links .
the phones are expected to revolutionise communications .
sophisticated handsets will be able to guide drivers through towns and cities , receive e-mail , or allow people to play computer games across the world .
european telecom companies have spent a collective £ 60bn on auctions to purchase 3g licences in countries across europe .
the licences allow the winning companies to build 3g networks and provide services to their local populations .
a ' study in madness ' professor cochrane , who was responsible for bt 's 3g research programme until november 2000 , said the auction process was " a really good study in madness " . "
it was a bit like lemmings going over the edge of a cliff " professor peter cochrane " it was a bit like lemmings going over the edge of a cliff , " he added .
in the uk , orange , bt , vodafone , and one2one and a consortium backed by hutchison whampoa paid out a combined total of £ 22bn to secure a uk licence .
yet more money will be spent on building the networks and developing new phones to handle the upgraded technology .
in the uk alone , it is estimated that 3g networks will need up to 28,000 new masts and base stations .
" i think europe has shot itself in the foot , and certainly the uk has , because i do n't think we are going to see 3g , " said the professor .
confident despite such negative sentiment , the telecom companies remain confident in public .
orange 's richard brennan told the money programme : " if we were to paint a picture of 3g , it would be a world where you have this remote control for life . "
bt is also upbeat about the future applications of 3g technology , as well as the financial rewards .
kent thexton from bt said in the programme : " now , 60 % of the uk population have found a way to put into their monthly expenditure their mobile phone bills ... and what we 're talking about is adding to that . "
city analysts , however , are more sceptical and some predict it could be 10 years before the telecom companies get their money back , if at all .
the money programme 's report " mobile madness " will be broadcast on wednesday , 28 march , at 1930 uk time -lrb- 1830 gmt -rrb- on bbc two .
