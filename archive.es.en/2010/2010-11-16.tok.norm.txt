program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany may send nuclear waste to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste disposal is a divisive issue in germany germany is seeking to export 951 spent nuclear fuel rods , currently held at a temporary storage facility in the country 's west , to russia – but critics have called the plans dangerous and irresponsible . it may not be a universally popular move , but exporting nuclear waste is permitted under german law – on the condition that the destination country disposes the waste safely .
in fact , germany has sent shipments of nuclear waste to russia several times in the past .
up until 2009 , one firm regularly exported uranium hexafluoride , or uf6 , from a fuel rod treatment facility in gronau .
uf6 is a by-product created when uranium is enriched , and in order to avoid legal difficulties associated with disposing radioactive waste , the company rebranded its by-product as a resource to be sent to russia for processing .
the deliveries were stopped in 2009 , partly as a result of fierce protests .
now , the export of german nuclear waste to russia is back on the cards , as the german government considers an application to export 951 spent fuel rods to russia for disposal .
according to critics , however , the stakes may be higher this time around .
" we 're dealing with something different , " said tobias muenchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
greater fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian processing facility , mayak , was the site of one of the largest ever nuclear explosions muenchmeyer said that unlike uf6 , which is associated with low radiation levels , " we 're dealing with the spent nuclear fuel from a research reactor in germany , which , like all nuclear waste , also contains plutonium and other fission products and therefore represents incredibly dangerous cargo . "
the fuel rods , from a former east german research reactor near dresden , were originally imported from the soviet union in 1957 and were used until 1991 .
research reactors often use highly enriched material compared to most nuclear power plants – including material that can be used to make atom bombs .
russia and the united states have agreed to take back such waste in order to limit the spread of weapons-grade material and the german state of saxony , which owns the rods , is relying on that agreement to wash its hands of the matter .
because there is no interim storage facility in saxony , the fuel rods were moved in 2005 to ahaus in the state of north rhine-westphalia and saxony has been paying rent for their storage ever since .
" our position is clear , " a spokesperson for saxony 's science ministry said recently , " as long as international conditions are satisfied , then we want to see the material put back where it belongs . "
passing the rod as far as saxony is concerned , ' where it belongs ' is in a russian nuclear facility at mayak , some 150 km south-east of ekaterinburg .
for the opposition greens , though , mayak is anything but a safe repository .
" we know that mayak is highly contaminated , " said sylvia kotting-uhl , greens spokesperson for nuclear policy .
" we also know that mayak is not operated with anything like the same philosophy of safety that is considered standard here in germany .
so to move the waste fuel rods there is incredibly negligent . "
mayak – or ' lighthouse ' – is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union , and was also home , in 1957 , to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
some experts consider mayak 's environment to be more polluted than that of chernobyl , the site of the soviet union 's worst nuclear accident .
germany 's environment ministry , which confirmed that it had received an application to export the waste after press reports first uncovered the story last week , is responsible for determining whether such an export would be legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent transport of nuclear waste to gorleben , in northern germany , sparked mass protests setting a precedent an environment ministry spokesperson said that it would " only make a decision after careful consideration of questions over the safety of the russian site mayak . "
if the experts decide that mayak is safe , little will stand between the waste and its final repository .
the environment ministry has confirmed that a delivery contract has already been drawn up between germany and russia , ready to be signed .
this has left anti-nuclear groups and the opposition concerned , and only in part because they believe the 349 kilograms of plutonium will not be stored safely if they do make their way to mayak .
some fear the export could create a precedent , and encourage nations like russia to trade nuclear waste for cash .
greenpeace 's thomas muenchmeyer says that russians have extended such offers to accept waste in the past , but that " few of those have been official so far . "
he says south korea and taiwan are also potentially interested in such trades , but these are " still – thankfully - completely taboo in europe . "
the european union 's energy chief , guenther oettinger , recently announced plans to introduce a europe-wide ban on the export of nuclear waste .
the announcement was welcomed cautiously by anti-nuclear campaigners , who are concerned that it could contain loopholes when it comes to the export of ' resources ' like uf6 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 german pen association honors chinese dissident liu xiaobo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : award-winning chinese writer liu xiaobo is currently in prison for political reasons incarcerated in china for his subversive political activities , writer and nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo has received a special award from the german pen committee in honor of his achievements . in honor of the writers in prison day on november 15 , the german branch of international writers ' association pen highlighted the plight of persecuted writers around the world , including the nearly 900 journalists and writers who at present are detained in around 100 countries .
one of these writers is chinese nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo , currently incarcerated in china as a political prisoner . chosen as the winner of this year 's hermann kesten medal - a prize awarded annually by pen for outstanding efforts in support of persecuted authors - liu was eagerly awaited by a group of guests at the ceremony in the german city of darmstadt last week , but neither he nor his wife could attend , said the president of the german branch of pen , johano strasser . behind bars at this time , liu is serving time at a jail 450 kilometers north of beijing .
on december 25 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 11 years ' imprisonment on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power . liu was one of the creators of charter 08 - a manifesto initially signed in 2008 by over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in china .
the document currently has around 10,000 signatures and demands rights such as freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and the right to form political parties . tilman spengler , one of the ceremony 's hosts , pointed out that these demands are in full accordance with the chinese constitution , which , at least in theory , guarantees human rights . bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is passionate about advancing democracy and human rights in china theory and reality in china , those who , like liu , actively support human rights , are carefully scrutinized by the authorities .
since the nobel committee announced him as the winner of the peace prize in october , pressure on those who do n't follow the government line in china has increased .
numerous dissidents , including liu 's wife , are under house arrest , have faced interrogations or have been preemptively detained . the chinese government has been doing all it can to keep its citizens away from the nobel peace prize ceremony , which is due to be held on december 10 in oslo .
just recently , china 's authorities prevented liu 's lawyer mo shaoping from leaving the country on allegations of endangering national security .
according to geir lundestad , director of the norwegian nobel institute , it is likely that neither the diploma nor the medal can be awarded , since neither liu nor anyone associated with him will be allowed to attend . ' for the victims ' chinese author and president of the chinese pen center , tianchi martin-liao , accepted the hermann kesten prize on behalf of liu .
she was a logical choice for this role , as the two of them are friends and liu himself is a former president of pen in china . in her emotional acceptance speech , martin-liao described liu 's reaction to the news from the nobel committee .
according to her , the first sentence that the tearful liu uttered was , " this prize is for the victims of the 4th of june 1989 . " for liu , the chinese democratic movement and its brutal end at the tiananmen square massacre was a turning point .
he repeatedly said that he , as a survivor , felt a duty to fight for justice on behalf of those who had been killed in the incident . a mission this sense of duty led to liu 's imprisonment .
but despite the brutal measures taken against him , liu does not see himself as a victim , but rather as a person who was aware of the risks he was facing . " as soon as you have made your decision , you should have an optimistic stance towards the risk and the pressure , with self-confidence and calmness , " said liu in 2007 . in this regard , liu is a worthy recipient of the hermann kesten medal , which is endowed with 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,600 -rrb- .
hermann kesten himself was more famous for his support of other authors than for his writings - and for passionately standing up for persecuted artists in the nazi era . author : matthias von hein -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of these writers is chinese nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo , currently incarcerated in china as a political prisoner . chosen as the winner of this year 's hermann kesten medal - a prize awarded annually by pen for outstanding efforts in support of persecuted authors - liu was eagerly awaited by a group of guests at the ceremony in the german city of darmstadt last week , but neither he nor his wife could attend , said the president of the german branch of pen , johano strasser . behind bars at this time , liu is serving time at a jail 450 kilometers north of beijing .
on december 25 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 11 years ' imprisonment on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power . liu was one of the creators of charter 08 - a manifesto initially signed in 2008 by over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in china .
the document currently has around 10,000 signatures and demands rights such as freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and the right to form political parties . tilman spengler , one of the ceremony 's hosts , pointed out that these demands are in full accordance with the chinese constitution , which , at least in theory , guarantees human rights . bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is passionate about advancing democracy and human rights in china theory and reality in china , those who , like liu , actively support human rights , are carefully scrutinized by the authorities .
since the nobel committee announced him as the winner of the peace prize in october , pressure on those who do n't follow the government line in china has increased .
numerous dissidents , including liu 's wife , are under house arrest , have faced interrogations or have been preemptively detained . the chinese government has been doing all it can to keep its citizens away from the nobel peace prize ceremony , which is due to be held on december 10 in oslo .
just recently , china 's authorities prevented liu 's lawyer mo shaoping from leaving the country on allegations of endangering national security .
according to geir lundestad , director of the norwegian nobel institute , it is likely that neither the diploma nor the medal can be awarded , since neither liu nor anyone associated with him will be allowed to attend . ' for the victims ' chinese author and president of the chinese pen center , tianchi martin-liao , accepted the hermann kesten prize on behalf of liu .
she was a logical choice for this role , as the two of them are friends and liu himself is a former president of pen in china . in her emotional acceptance speech , martin-liao described liu 's reaction to the news from the nobel committee .
according to her , the first sentence that the tearful liu uttered was , " this prize is for the victims of the 4th of june 1989 . " for liu , the chinese democratic movement and its brutal end at the tiananmen square massacre was a turning point .
he repeatedly said that he , as a survivor , felt a duty to fight for justice on behalf of those who had been killed in the incident . a mission this sense of duty led to liu 's imprisonment .
but despite the brutal measures taken against him , liu does not see himself as a victim , but rather as a person who was aware of the risks he was facing . " as soon as you have made your decision , you should have an optimistic stance towards the risk and the pressure , with self-confidence and calmness , " said liu in 2007 . in this regard , liu is a worthy recipient of the hermann kesten medal , which is endowed with 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,600 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 french senate passes new e-book law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed law would affect books sold for the kindle , ipad the bill , which is expected to pass the national assembly later this month , would let publishers set e-book prices .
the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disarmament -pipe- 16.11.2010 white house pushes for start , but ratification remains uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the start treaty would cut us and russian nuclear arsenals with ratification of the new start treaty only likely to be more difficult when the next congress takes office in 2011 , the white house is pushing for a vote in the lame-duck senate .
but success is all but sure . on sunday , us president barack obama and his cabinet launched a coordinated public relations blitz aimed at rallying support for the ratification of the nuclear disarmament pact washington had negotiated with moscow .
following a meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev on the sidelines of the apec economic summit in seoul , obama promised to get the us-russian nuclear arms reduction deal passed before the new congress takes office next year .
" i reiterated my commitment to get the start treaty done during the lame duck session , and i 've communicated to congress that it is a top priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original treaty was signed by george bush and mikhail gorbachev in 1991 one day later , on monday , us secretary of state , hillary clinton , and defense secretary robert gates followed up with a op-ed article in the washington post , urging congress to quickly ratify the so-called new start treaty - the successor of the original start initiated by president ronald reagan , which expired at the end of last year .
under the headline " we ca n't delay this treaty , " clinton and gates made the case for congress to pass the treaty , arguing that " our national security depends on it . " high stakes the full-court press by the obama administration highlights both the importance and the stakes for ratification of new start that would limit american and russian strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 respectively , and improve the verification regime .
but analysts are skeptical as to whether the joint appeal by obama , clinton and gates will be enough to persuade republicans to vote for the new start pact .
some republican lawmakers believe the treaty weakens the us , while others feel strongly that the newly elected senate should be given a chance to vote on the pact .
still others are loathe to give obama a victory in his lame-duck session , and are looking to renegotiate the treaty entirely . ratification requires a two-third majority , or 67 votes in the us senate .
democrats can command 59 votes in the current senate ; in the next senate they will only control 53 votes .
" i think it is doubtful that this extremely important step will be taken by the united states , " said karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at harvard university .
" the atmosphere of hostility and partisanship in the united states is such that the vote that the senate foreign relations committee took - where a majority actually voted in favor of the treaty - i do not think can be repeated .
even in a lame-duck session , ” kaiser told deutsche welle .
while some senior republican foreign-policy experts , such as richard lugar , support start and want to help get it passed , others want to renegotiate the deal or think a vote should be taken by the new congress .
political football ?
the treaty is a solid , if not overly ambitious agreement , and it should be ratified since it would increase us national security , argues patricia lewis , deputy director of the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratification will only become tougher when the new senate is sworn in " if it gets turned into political football between two parties in the country and has nothing to do with the larger and wider security issues then who is to know what will happen , " lewis told deutsche welle .
she added : " i really hope that it does get ratified and as soon as possible .
because right now there are no inspections on strategic weapons .
we want to move ahead with better and more wide-ranging cuts with the russians , and doing that if this is n't ratified would be very difficult . "
in light of its experience with the comprehensive test ban treaty , which moscow ratified and the us did n't , russia said this time around that it would only ratify new start after washington had done so .
therefore , according to kaiser , " a setback would also be very bad for the long-term goal of getting rid of all nuclear weapons and non-proliferation . "

but success is all but sure . on sunday , us president barack obama and his cabinet launched a coordinated public relations blitz aimed at rallying support for the ratification of the nuclear disarmament pact washington had negotiated with moscow .
following a meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev on the sidelines of the apec economic summit in seoul , obama promised to get the us-russian nuclear arms reduction deal passed before the new congress takes office next year .
" i reiterated my commitment to get the start treaty done during the lame duck session , and i 've communicated to congress that it is a top priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original treaty was signed by george bush and mikhail gorbachev in 1991 one day later , on monday , us secretary of state , hillary clinton , and defense secretary robert gates followed up with a op-ed article in the washington post , urging congress to quickly ratify the so-called new start treaty - the successor of the original start initiated by president ronald reagan , which expired at the end of last year .
under the headline " we ca n't delay this treaty , " clinton and gates made the case for congress to pass the treaty , arguing that " our national security depends on it .

but analysts are skeptical as to whether the joint appeal by obama , clinton and gates will be enough to persuade republicans to vote for the new start pact .
some republican lawmakers believe the treaty weakens the us , while others feel strongly that the newly elected senate should be given a chance to vote on the pact .
still others are loathe to give obama a victory in his lame-duck session , and are looking to renegotiate the treaty entirely . ratification requires a two-third majority , or 67 votes in the us senate .
democrats can command 59 votes in the current senate ; in the next senate they will only control 53 votes .
" i think it is doubtful that this extremely important step will be taken by the united states , " said karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at harvard university .
" the atmosphere of hostility and partisanship in the united states is such that the vote that the senate foreign relations committee took - where a majority actually voted in favor of the treaty - i do not think can be repeated .

while some senior republican foreign-policy experts , such as richard lugar , support start and want to help get it passed , others want to renegotiate the deal or think a vote should be taken by the new congress .
political football ?
the treaty is a solid , if not overly ambitious agreement , and it should be ratified since it would increase us national security , argues patricia lewis , deputy director of the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratification will only become tougher when the new senate is sworn in " if it gets turned into political football between two parties in the country and has nothing to do with the larger and wider security issues then who is to know what will happen , " lewis told deutsche welle .
she added : " i really hope that it does get ratified and as soon as possible .
because right now there are no inspections on strategic weapons .
we want to move ahead with better and more wide-ranging cuts with the russians , and doing that if this is n't ratified would be very difficult . "
in light of its experience with the comprehensive test ban treaty , which moscow ratified and the us did n't , russia said this time around that it would only ratify new start after washington had done so .
therefore , according to kaiser , " a setback would also be very bad for the long-term goal of getting rid of all nuclear weapons and non-proliferation . "
and lewis said that if the us does n't ratify the treaty , " the trust in the united states as a negotiating partner , as a partner with whom you can do business , as a partner who can give their word and keep their word ... becomes further diminished .

though facing record unpopularity , sarkozy maintained that some ministers still have his trust . facing record-low approval , french president nicolas sarkozy used a televised interview tuesday to defend his reorganized government and his conservative agenda to the french people . the french president also renewed his call for global financial reform on the heels of a g20 summit in seoul , where he took over the group ’ s leadership . " we can no longer stay in this monetary mess … we need a new international monetary system , " he said , confirming that china would host a conference on the matter in early 2011 " to see if we can move forward . ” reshuffle defended a major portion of sarkozy ’ s interview on three french tv channels focused on his reappointment of french prime minister francois fillon and changes made to his cabinet . sarkozy had quite some explaining to do , with one opinion poll on monday showing 64 percent of france already mistrusted the new government . sarkozy rebuilt his cabinet this past weekend , firing several center-right and left-leaning ministers and filling their posts with faithful allies .
sarkozy also gave the cabinet a trim , leaving 31 ministers where there had previously been 37 . fillon too popular to be ousted sarkozy told his interviewers that fillon was still " the best prime minister for france . ” " when i asked francois fillon to continue , it 's because i have great trust in him , because he 's very competent , because we 've worked together for years without a cloud , " sarkozy added . in reality , sarkozy had little choice but to reappoint fillon , whose approval ratings far outshine the president ’ s .
a recent poll showed 71 percent of respondents preferring fillon to sarkozy . bildunterschrift : many say sarkozy resents fillon 's popularity other ministers in sarkozy 's favor were allowed to remain in office .
sarkozy said it would have made no sense to replace economics minister christine lagarde and added that , for others , the swap would mark a " new stage . ” " a certain amount of stability helps to soothe a country that is in need , " sarkozy said . a new ‘ campaign team ’ ? sarkozy 's restructuring aims at creating a team more likely to get behind his deficit-cutting austerity agenda and securing support for the upcoming presidential elections in 2012 . but the president denied criticism that his leaner , more conservative cabinet was " a campaign team " ahead of france ’ s 2012 presidential election . " i remain convinced that we must be open , " he said .
" this is not a partisan government ; this is a tightened government . " sarkozy said his reshuffled government would remain in place until the 2012 presidential elections , adding that he had not yet decided whether to throw his hat back in the ring for a second term and would not announce his decision until late 2011 . sarkozy had first signalled in march that he intended to rebuild his cabinet – a plan he confirmed in july . the reshuffle came after months of intrigues and mass street protests against sarkozy 's unpopular extension of the base retirement age from 60 to 62 years . the president ’ s approval rating continues to wane , having hit 35 percent this month .
still , the president remained strongly behind his unpopular pension reform and his controversial expulsion of illegal roma residents , adding that he had no regrets concerning inflammatory remarks he made linking immigration to delinquency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal called the president a ' liar ' harsh criticism opponents on tuesday took advantage of the president 's ever-slipping popularity to criticize sarkozy .
president of the centrist democratic movement party , francois bayrou , slammed sarkozy after the interview for talking too much about himself and too little about the problems facing the french people . " there wasn ’ t a word about education , nor was there a word about the environment , and there was no credible strategy to revive production in france , " bayrou said . socialist former presidential candidate segolene royal also attacked sarkozy after his interview , calling him " a president weakened by his failures " and " discredited by his lies " - the greatest of which , she said , was the claim he had not yet decided to run for reelection . author : david levitz , sarah steffen -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this will have an impact on german politics , says dw 's peter stützle . germany remains a haven for political stability .
this can by all means be predicted after the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- party conference .
parties who manipulate resentments against foreigners may win elections in many other european countries - in germany they do n't .
and the cdu has done a lot at its convention in karlsruhe to assure it stays that way .
people 's concerns that might be exploited by right-wing populists elsewhere are taken seriously by the cdu in germany .
there is undeniably a fear among a wide section of society that migrants from other cultures develop parallel societies and can not contribute towards the country 's welfare because of their lack of language skills and education .
the cdu addresses this discomfort , but stays away from populist slogans and focuses on sophisticated statements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu prevents right-wing populists from gaining strength , says stuetzle in short : yes to the immigration of skilled laborers , but only after the country 's unemployed have gotten a chance on the labor market .
migrants who are already living in germany are welcome , but they have to learn the german language and respect the laws and basic values of the majority society .
to christian democrats , that is the balance between multicultural arbitrariness and assimilation .
the cdu convention agreed to follow that line without long-winded discussions .
beforehand , the cdu discussed one question in detail that especially plagued people with strong christian beliefs : should embryos which were conceived outside the womb be screened in order to rule out hereditary diseases before they get implanted ?
two positions - strict rejection and approval for limited cases - were considered in a very serious way .
in the end , a razor-thin majority chose the former .
conservatives across the spectrum stayed at home during national elections a year ago and even more so during federal elections in north rhine-westphalia , because they did n't feel adequately represented by the cdu . by accommodating their needs , the cdu is also playing power games - intent on securing its majority .
but because it also prevents the right-wing populists from gaining strength , it also serves the democratic stability of the biggest country in the heart of europe .

this will have an impact on german politics , says dw 's peter stützle . germany remains a haven for political stability .
this can by all means be predicted after the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- party conference .

and the cdu has done a lot at its convention in karlsruhe to assure it stays that way .
people 's concerns that might be exploited by right-wing populists elsewhere are taken seriously by the cdu in germany .
there is undeniably a fear among a wide section of society that migrants from other cultures develop parallel societies and can not contribute towards the country 's welfare because of their lack of language skills and education .
the cdu addresses this discomfort , but stays away from populist slogans and focuses on sophisticated statements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu prevents right-wing populists from gaining strength , says stuetzle in short : yes to the immigration of skilled laborers , but only after the country 's unemployed have gotten a chance on the labor market .
migrants who are already living in germany are welcome , but they have to learn the german language and respect the laws and basic values of the majority society .
to christian democrats , that is the balance between multicultural arbitrariness and assimilation .
the cdu convention agreed to follow that line without long-winded discussions .
beforehand , the cdu discussed one question in detail that especially plagued people with strong christian beliefs : should embryos which were conceived outside the womb be screened in order to rule out hereditary diseases before they get implanted ?
two positions - strict rejection and approval for limited cases - were considered in a very serious way .
in the end , a razor-thin majority chose the former .
conservatives across the spectrum stayed at home during national elections a year ago and even more so during federal elections in north rhine-westphalia , because they did n't feel adequately represented by the cdu . by accommodating their needs , the cdu is also playing power games - intent on securing its majority .
but because it also prevents the right-wing populists from gaining strength , it also serves the democratic stability of the biggest country in the heart of europe .

the party also wants to introduce stricter rules for foreigners who refuse to integrate . at its annual party conference , german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on tuesday voted to ban the screening of embryos used in ivf treatment .
a tight majority of 51 percent of the delegates voted to retain existing policy on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
policy from 2007 allows in vitro fertilization but makes it illegal to check the cells for hereditary diseases .
chancellor merkel had been pushing the ban in the run-up to the convention in karlsruhe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was among those who favor a ban " i favor a pgd ban because i am concerned that we can not define its limits properly , " merkel said on monday .
the issue is of key importance to the party as the cdu has , by definition , to uphold christian values .
according to mainstream christian teaching , life begins at conception .
deep divisions the party is however deeply divided over the issue , and the conference experienced an emotional debate lasting more than three hours .
for many , the memory of the nazis administering lethal injections to handicapped children forbids embryo screening in modern germany .
" if life is a gift from god , it is not given with any condition , " julia kloeckner , leader of cdu in the state of rhineland palatinate said .
" it would be disturbing for doctors to decide which embryos should be allowed to live by saying ' you 're okay , you 're not , " ' she added .
a lesser evil compared to still births and abortions but to delegates in favor of restricted pgd use , pre-screening would be the lesser evil compared to still births and abortions .
" there is a difference between an embryo before and after -lsb- implantation in the womb -rsb- has taken place , " said minister for family affairs kristina schroeder .
other cdu delegates agree .
according to peter hintze , deputy economics minister , it does not make sense that numerous examinations of the fetus inside the womb are allowed , but examinations of the embryo in a petri dish are not .
" pgd would not mean the creation of a designer baby , ” hintze , a protestant theologian , said .
" whoever believes the desire for a blue-eyed baby would lead anyone to undergo ivf , does not meet reality at all . "
jens spahn , cdu 's expert on health matters , did not believe that pre-screening techniques will be limited to serious diseases only .
legislation expected in july , the federal court of justice ruled that pgd is currently exempt from punishment .
in the coming weeks , the german parliament , the bundestag , will decide whether pgd should be banned by law .
tuesday ’ s decision might dissuade some cdu delegates from voting against the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded a debate on pgd justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the cdu 's coalition partner the fdp , criticized the decision and said a debate was needed in order to define strict guidelines for the use of pgd .
many of her party colleagues demand a limited usage of the technique .
other european nations such as britain , france , belgium and denmark already permit the screening .
integration policy the cdu also decided on stricter rules for foreigners who are not willing to integrate .
chancellor merkel recently declared multiculturalism to have failed and the conference agreed to pursue an integration policy that was in the " interests of germany " and an end to the " politics of misunderstood tolerance . "
" those rules are actually quite simple .
whoever wants to live here has to learn german .
whoever lives here has to respect our laws and values , " merkel said .
" those who do not follow the rules can expect to face sanctions . "

the party also wants to introduce stricter rules for foreigners who refuse to integrate . at its annual party conference , german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on tuesday voted to ban the screening of embryos used in ivf treatment .
a tight majority of 51 percent of the delegates voted to retain existing policy on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
policy from 2007 allows in vitro fertilization but makes it illegal to check the cells for hereditary diseases .
chancellor merkel had been pushing the ban in the run-up to the convention in karlsruhe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was among those who favor a ban " i favor a pgd ban because i am concerned that we can not define its limits properly , " merkel said on monday .
the issue is of key importance to the party as the cdu has , by definition , to uphold christian values .
according to mainstream christian teaching , life begins at conception .
deep divisions the party is however deeply divided over the issue , and the conference experienced an emotional debate lasting more than three hours .
for many , the memory of the nazis administering lethal injections to handicapped children forbids embryo screening in modern germany .
" if life is a gift from god , it is not given with any condition , " julia kloeckner , leader of cdu in the state of rhineland palatinate said .
" it would be disturbing for doctors to decide which embryos should be allowed to live by saying ' you 're okay , you 're not , " ' she added .
a lesser evil compared to still births and abortions but to delegates in favor of restricted pgd use , pre-screening would be the lesser evil compared to still births and abortions .
" there is a difference between an embryo before and after -lsb- implantation in the womb -rsb- has taken place , " said minister for family affairs kristina schroeder .
other cdu delegates agree .
according to peter hintze , deputy economics minister , it does not make sense that numerous examinations of the fetus inside the womb are allowed , but examinations of the embryo in a petri dish are not .
" pgd would not mean the creation of a designer baby , ” hintze , a protestant theologian , said .
" whoever believes the desire for a blue-eyed baby would lead anyone to undergo ivf , does not meet reality at all . "
jens spahn , cdu 's expert on health matters , did not believe that pre-screening techniques will be limited to serious diseases only .
legislation expected in july , the federal court of justice ruled that pgd is currently exempt from punishment .
in the coming weeks , the german parliament , the bundestag , will decide whether pgd should be banned by law .
tuesday ’ s decision might dissuade some cdu delegates from voting against the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded a debate on pgd justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the cdu 's coalition partner the fdp , criticized the decision and said a debate was needed in order to define strict guidelines for the use of pgd .
many of her party colleagues demand a limited usage of the technique .
other european nations such as britain , france , belgium and denmark already permit the screening .
integration policy the cdu also decided on stricter rules for foreigners who are not willing to integrate .
chancellor merkel recently declared multiculturalism to have failed and the conference agreed to pursue an integration policy that was in the " interests of germany " and an end to the " politics of misunderstood tolerance . "
" those rules are actually quite simple .
whoever wants to live here has to learn german .
whoever lives here has to respect our laws and values , " merkel said .
" those who do not follow the rules can expect to face sanctions . "

the eu 's economy commissioner said the bloc was in talks with the imf on tackling problems in the irish banking sector . the european union on tuesday announced it is in talks with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- about taking on growing problems in ireland 's banking sector .
eu economy commissioner olli rehn said ahead of a meeting with eurozone finance ministers in brussels that ireland 's banking crisis was " the most pressing problem " facing the monetary union . meanwhile , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who headed tuesday 's talks by the panel of financial ministers known as the eurogroup , vowed to protect the 16-nation euro currency . juncker urged that the irish government would have to decide on financial aid , with inevitable strings attached , within days .
however , he stressed that no aid could be given if ireland did not request it . " the discussions that will take place between ireland and the -lsb- european -rsb- commission and the ecb and the imf will enable us to have at our disposal all the elements and instruments we need were ireland to make a request for assistance to the eu , the imf and the europgroup , " juncker told reporters . euro ' not threatened ' solvency concerns have grown in ireland after a 45 billion euro -lrb- $ 61 billion -rrb- bailout for private banks increased its deficit in 2010 to 32 percent of gross domestic product .
however , rehn also pointed out that the crisis in ireland was limited to its banking sector , and that the government was " funded well until the middle of next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn says ireland 's banking crisis is the eurozone 's biggest problem rehn cautioned against alarmism , saying the irish debt crisis was " not a matter of survival for the euro . "
german chancellor angela merkel repeated this assurance tuesday evening , telling ard public television she did not believe the eurozone to be in danger , but that the bloc was " experiencing turmoil and situations of the kind i would n't have dreamed of a year and a half ago , " merkel added .
rumor mill irish prime minister brian cowen meanwhile sought to dispel rumors in an address to parliament tuesday that ireland had already applied for an additional bailout for its banks .
" we have not applied to any facility .
despite the fact that it was being mentioned in a lot of so-called reputable news organizations does not make it any truer , " cowen said . he said ireland was discussing with the eu about ways to normalize market conditions and was attempting to ensure that any decisions were also in the interest of stabilizing the eurozone . a financial crisis in greece that similarly threatened the euro forced it to accept a rescue package on a larger scale earlier this year , which came with many conditions from the eu and imf . waiting on ireland bildunterschrift : ireland 's banking problems are seen as a euro threat ireland 's reluctance to accept a rescue package may be to avoid similar conditions in an effort to solve its banking crisis on its own .
however , newspaper reports in the country suggested ireland was moving closer to a bailout as the eu piled on the pressure .
" to fend off being forced into a bailout for the entire state , finance minister brian lenihan is poised to agree to a bank injection to stabilize the euro and calm markets , " the irish independent reported , citing an unnamed source .
ca n't ' throw money from helicopters ' meanwhile in a visit to rome , germany 's economy minister rainer bruederle said " throwing money from helicopters " was not a solution to fixing economic problems .
the economic phrase refers to a practice where a government simply creates money until the economy gets going again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle says money should n't be ' thrown from helicopters ' bruederle said countries like ireland or greece should implement reforms to reduce deficits in order to eliminate the need for future bailouts .
" the european community as a whole has an interest in finding a way to have guarantees of a solution when there are difficulties , " he said .
meanwhile , the ecb is currently channeling about a quarter of its loans into irish banks , and ireland has put the figure required to save its financial institutions at around 50 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disarmament -pipe- 16.11.2010 white house pushes for start , but ratification remains uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the start treaty would cut us and russian nuclear arsenals with ratification of the new start treaty only likely to be more difficult when the next congress takes office in 2011 , the white house is pushing for a vote in the lame-duck senate .
but success is all but sure . on sunday , us president barack obama and his cabinet launched a coordinated public relations blitz aimed at rallying support for the ratification of the nuclear disarmament pact washington had negotiated with moscow .
following a meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev on the sidelines of the apec economic summit in seoul , obama promised to get the us-russian nuclear arms reduction deal passed before the new congress takes office next year .
" i reiterated my commitment to get the start treaty done during the lame duck session , and i 've communicated to congress that it is a top priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original treaty was signed by george bush and mikhail gorbachev in 1991 one day later , on monday , us secretary of state , hillary clinton , and defense secretary robert gates followed up with a op-ed article in the washington post , urging congress to quickly ratify the so-called new start treaty - the successor of the original start initiated by president ronald reagan , which expired at the end of last year .
under the headline " we ca n't delay this treaty , " clinton and gates made the case for congress to pass the treaty , arguing that " our national security depends on it . " high stakes the full-court press by the obama administration highlights both the importance and the stakes for ratification of new start that would limit american and russian strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 respectively , and improve the verification regime .
but analysts are skeptical as to whether the joint appeal by obama , clinton and gates will be enough to persuade republicans to vote for the new start pact .
some republican lawmakers believe the treaty weakens the us , while others feel strongly that the newly elected senate should be given a chance to vote on the pact .
still others are loathe to give obama a victory in his lame-duck session , and are looking to renegotiate the treaty entirely . ratification requires a two-third majority , or 67 votes in the us senate .
democrats can command 59 votes in the current senate ; in the next senate they will only control 53 votes .
" i think it is doubtful that this extremely important step will be taken by the united states , " said karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at harvard university .
" the atmosphere of hostility and partisanship in the united states is such that the vote that the senate foreign relations committee took - where a majority actually voted in favor of the treaty - i do not think can be repeated .
even in a lame-duck session , ” kaiser told deutsche welle .
while some senior republican foreign-policy experts , such as richard lugar , support start and want to help get it passed , others want to renegotiate the deal or think a vote should be taken by the new congress .
political football ?
the treaty is a solid , if not overly ambitious agreement , and it should be ratified since it would increase us national security , argues patricia lewis , deputy director of the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratification will only become tougher when the new senate is sworn in " if it gets turned into political football between two parties in the country and has nothing to do with the larger and wider security issues then who is to know what will happen , " lewis told deutsche welle .
she added : " i really hope that it does get ratified and as soon as possible .
because right now there are no inspections on strategic weapons .
we want to move ahead with better and more wide-ranging cuts with the russians , and doing that if this is n't ratified would be very difficult . "
in light of its experience with the comprehensive test ban treaty , which moscow ratified and the us did n't , russia said this time around that it would only ratify new start after washington had done so .
therefore , according to kaiser , " a setback would also be very bad for the long-term goal of getting rid of all nuclear weapons and non-proliferation . "
and lewis said that if the us does n't ratify the treaty , " the trust in the united states as a negotiating partner , as a partner with whom you can do business , as a partner who can give their word and keep their word ... becomes further diminished .
that would be a real pity . "
europe 's role lewis and kaiser have different opinions as to how much influence europe and the rest of the world can have on the ratification of the treaty .
" i think the entire world will disagree if the treaty does n't get ratified because this is literally what everybody has wanted , " argues kaiser , who believes europe has n't done enough to support the ratification of the deal .
" it is not enough to simply agree with the vision of a non-nuclear world .
that 's very popular in europe .
nor is it enough to just argue you have to get rid of tactical nuclear weapons , as a number of europeans countries have done , " kaiser said .
according to kaiser , europe needs to give signals to the americans " at the highest political levels , notably the senate , " that the world expects american leadership in this matter .
but for her part , lewis is n't sure how useful it is to put more international pressure on the us .
" the united states is a democracy .
and this is very much a debate within the united states democracy , " she said . " it 's a debate for the senate to have .
i think there is a limit to which other countries can have a huge impact on domestic debates . "

although zuckerberg would be quick to say messages is not e-mail , facebook users will have an @ facebook.com address once the system is released , so it definitely looks similar .
one of the features of messages highlighted in the press conference is its archival function , basically storing all records of messages sent between parties .
given some of facebook 's history with privacy issues , this feature could create some discomfort for less public users .
a digital shoebox facebook 's messaging system has always been integral to the platform , providing users with a slightly less public forum for discussion than publishing everything on " facebook walls , " the bulletin boards that display the activities of a user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook 's latest plans have created a media stir with messages , zuckerberg says the concept is to " flatten " the landscape of communication .
teens , he said at the press conference , prefer sms over e-mail because the latter is too slow , whereas others strictly use e-mail or instant messaging to talk to their friends and family .
so facebook intends to use messages to aggregate these three different means of communication into one conversation .
one user may send an sms , another might reply with an e-mail , but both messages appear on facebook as part of a conversation .
the result , facebook says , will be a continuous collection of conversation history between friends .
the image used in promotional material by facebook is that messages will be analogous to the boxes of letters people once used to collect and cherish , as a way to remember the course of a relationship .

but users may " promote " mail from these folders to their primary folders if they wish .
the conversation history will be stored on facebook , which could raise security concerns for some .
when asked about an option for " off the record " conversations at the press conference , zuckerberg responded that users would have the option to delete threads or messages , but that " off the record " does n't make sense .
in the past , facebook has weathered criticism for some of the wording in their terms of use , which in february 2009 , briefly seemed to state that facebook would own any content a user uploaded to the public site , in perpetuity .
facebook and zuckerberg quickly moved to douse the flames of public outcry and released a new terms of use with the section on privacy right up at the top which states , " you own all of the content and information you post on facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings .

and some are wondering if the social network 's privacy policies are strong enough . at a press conference in san francisco , california on monday , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg unveiled the latest of the social networking platform ’ s innovations , facebook messages .
with this announcement , facebook , which counts more than 500 million users , is pushing into google 's turf with this e-mail-like service .
although zuckerberg would be quick to say messages is not e-mail , facebook users will have an @ facebook.com address once the system is released , so it definitely looks similar .
one of the features of messages highlighted in the press conference is its archival function , basically storing all records of messages sent between parties .
given some of facebook 's history with privacy issues , this feature could create some discomfort for less public users .
a digital shoebox facebook 's messaging system has always been integral to the platform , providing users with a slightly less public forum for discussion than publishing everything on " facebook walls , " the bulletin boards that display the activities of a user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook 's latest plans have created a media stir with messages , zuckerberg says the concept is to " flatten " the landscape of communication .
teens , he said at the press conference , prefer sms over e-mail because the latter is too slow , whereas others strictly use e-mail or instant messaging to talk to their friends and family .
so facebook intends to use messages to aggregate these three different means of communication into one conversation .
one user may send an sms , another might reply with an e-mail , but both messages appear on facebook as part of a conversation .
the result , facebook says , will be a continuous collection of conversation history between friends .
the image used in promotional material by facebook is that messages will be analogous to the boxes of letters people once used to collect and cherish , as a way to remember the course of a relationship .
but what about privacy ?
as the new system is gradually rolled out , users will be able to send and receive e-mails with their new @ facebook.com e-mail address .
at first , facebook users will only receive mail from their facebook friends , with all other mail going into an other or a junk mail folder .
but users may " promote " mail from these folders to their primary folders if they wish .
the conversation history will be stored on facebook , which could raise security concerns for some .
when asked about an option for " off the record " conversations at the press conference , zuckerberg responded that users would have the option to delete threads or messages , but that " off the record " does n't make sense .
in the past , facebook has weathered criticism for some of the wording in their terms of use , which in february 2009 , briefly seemed to state that facebook would own any content a user uploaded to the public site , in perpetuity .
facebook and zuckerberg quickly moved to douse the flames of public outcry and released a new terms of use with the section on privacy right up at the top which states , " you own all of the content and information you post on facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings . "

most people 's e-mail clients are clogged with old conversations , but mashable thinks that having a written record of all communication in proximity to the host of potentially personal information within facebook , could make for a dangerous mixture .

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .
" the last email which was sent -lsb- by police -rsb- told israilov to call the emergency number if needed … seven days later he was murdered . "
a witness silenced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israilov was a witness before the european court for human rights israilov filed charges against kadyrov after fleeing the chechen republic in 2006 , claiming to have witnessed killings and tortures conducted by kadyrov and his paramilitary forces .
he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .
the case was eventually dropped after israilov and his father disappeared into hiding and could n't be reached for further questioning .
israilov 's widow is reported to be living in austria with her four children .
his father , who is said to have fled europe in fear of his life , was expected to return to vienna for the court hearing under heavy security presence .

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .
" the last email which was sent -lsb- by police -rsb- told israilov to call the emergency number if needed … seven days later he was murdered . "
a witness silenced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israilov was a witness before the european court for human rights israilov filed charges against kadyrov after fleeing the chechen republic in 2006 , claiming to have witnessed killings and tortures conducted by kadyrov and his paramilitary forces .
he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .
the case was eventually dropped after israilov and his father disappeared into hiding and could n't be reached for further questioning .
israilov 's widow is reported to be living in austria with her four children .
his father , who is said to have fled europe in fear of his life , was expected to return to vienna for the court hearing under heavy security presence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 16.11.2010 haitian aid group : ' with cholera , rapid action is critical ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have only gotten worse in haiti after the earthquake as if it was n't enough of a task rebuilding haiti after the devastating earthquake , aid workers are now battling cholera there .
deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .
" the last email which was sent -lsb- by police -rsb- told israilov to call the emergency number if needed … seven days later he was murdered . "
a witness silenced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israilov was a witness before the european court for human rights israilov filed charges against kadyrov after fleeing the chechen republic in 2006 , claiming to have witnessed killings and tortures conducted by kadyrov and his paramilitary forces .
he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .
the case was eventually dropped after israilov and his father disappeared into hiding and could n't be reached for further questioning .
israilov 's widow is reported to be living in austria with her four children .
his father , who is said to have fled europe in fear of his life , was expected to return to vienna for the court hearing under heavy security presence .

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request .

ireland has come under pressure from eurozone leaders , who fear the country 's debt crisis could bring down the rest of the bloc .
debt is widespread in the eurozone and the eu , but ireland is currently seen as the weakest link .
portugal also in trouble meanwhile , portugal , which is already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , admitted on monday it was in difficulty , but portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said there were no plans as of yet for lisbon to request emergency funding .
at their monthly meeting in brussels , the eurozone finance ministers are also expected to discuss the future eurozone crisis resolution mechanism , which germany wants to start from 2013 , replacing the 440-billion-euro european financial stability facility set up after greece sought help in may .
the ministers are also expected to praise ireland 's 2011 budget cuts , which face a parliamentary vote of approval next month .
meanwhile , in ireland , finance minister brian lenihan is expected to release details of a new four-year debt-cutting program before the end of the month .

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request . "

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen says ireland will be just fine for another year under pressure ewald nowotny , a member of the european central bank 's governing council , said the european union wanted a " quick , good solution to ireland , so that there would be no spill-over " to other heavily indebted countries such as portugal and spain .
ireland has come under pressure from eurozone leaders , who fear the country 's debt crisis could bring down the rest of the bloc .
debt is widespread in the eurozone and the eu , but ireland is currently seen as the weakest link .
portugal also in trouble meanwhile , portugal , which is already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , admitted on monday it was in difficulty , but portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said there were no plans as of yet for lisbon to request emergency funding .
at their monthly meeting in brussels , the eurozone finance ministers are also expected to discuss the future eurozone crisis resolution mechanism , which germany wants to start from 2013 , replacing the 440-billion-euro european financial stability facility set up after greece sought help in may .
the ministers are also expected to praise ireland 's 2011 budget cuts , which face a parliamentary vote of approval next month .
meanwhile , in ireland , finance minister brian lenihan is expected to release details of a new four-year debt-cutting program before the end of the month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 16.11.2010 solar energy , regional politics dominate discussion between germany and morocco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moroccan capital rabat is the site of bilateral german-moroccan talks german foreign minister guido westerwelle is spending the early part of this week in morocco .
he wants to talk about energy , but his hosts have put a different issue on the agenda . the western sahara is an important region for a variety of reasons .
the prevalence of sun makes it an ideal location for solar energy facilities , and the area is rich in phosphate .
the disputed territory is also the subject of a tug-of-war between morocco and the algerian backed sahrawi arab democratic republic -lrb- sadr -rrb- , which wants it to become an independent state .
when german foreign minister guido westerwelle arrived in the moroccan capital on monday for the first day of a three-day visit , he was confronted with the issue .
he chose his words with care .
“ the main thing is that everyone involved places their faith in negotiations and dialogue , ” westerwelle said .
“ what we want to communicate to our partners is the message of non-violence . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is having to tread lightly moroccan foreign minister taieb fassi fihri interpreted that statement as an expression of support for his government 's position vis-a-vis the sahrawi national liberation movement polisario and its algerian backers .
“ you have heard the german foreign minister , who said appeals to violence , such as those unfortunately issued by polisario and algeria , will not lead to a solution , ” fihri said .
“ we greatly value the statement that negotiations are the most important thing . ”
but it is unclear whether dialogue will be sufficient to resolve a conflict that has existed for decades .
fence sitting bildunterschrift : morocco and algeria both have interests in the region the western sahara was part of spain 's african colonies from the late nineteenth-century until 1975 , when the spanish withdrew , and both morocco and mauritania tried to annex the territory .
that drew resistance from polisario , the nationalist movement for the sahrawi , an arab-berber ethnic group of over 250,000 people , who claim to be the original inhabitants of the region .
by 1979 a campaign of violent resistance by polisario , with the backing of algeria , had forced mauritania from the western sahara .
morocco , however , expanded its control , and in 1991 , a un peace-keeping mission succeeded in establishing a ceasefire .
the un has recognized sadr as a representative of western saharans , and a referendum was planned to let them decide between independence or remaining part of morocco with increased autonomy .
that referendum has been stalled , though , for the past two decades .
bildunterschrift : the future of the sahrawi is up in the air morocco voted for germany to be given a two-year seat on the united nations security council .
now rabat would like a political favor in return .
“ we consulted with germany before we presented our autonomy plan , a plan of compromise that fulfills the criteria of the un security council , ” fihri said .
but polisario and algeria would like to see an independent western saharan state , and westerwelle was careful not to throw clear support in one direction or the other .
“ we are not taking sides in this question , ” westerwelle said .
“ we 're a conversation partner , and above all , we place our faith in the mediating role of the united nations . ”
indeed , in morocco , westerwelle is more interested in talking economics than politics .
here comes the sun morocco is one of the few countries in the arab world that does n't produce oil , and rabat is investing heavily in solar energy .
that represents a convergence of influence with germany , which has enormous technical expertise in that area .
bildunterschrift : solar energy is becoming more important in the middle east so westerwelle 's visit is also an opportunity to drum up some business in a country that has traditionally been oriented more toward spain and france .
“ we germans have top technology , and i 'm thinking especially of solar-energy technology , ” westerwelle said .
“ and in cooperation with morocco , we can use this solar technology particularly well .
that also represents a major chance for german companies to do business . ”
underscoring the tight connection between economics , energy and politics is the fact that the head of morocco 's one power utility , ali fassi fihri , is the moroccan foreign minister 's brother .
morocco is currently engaged in a massive solar-energy project that will cost $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euros -rrb- and hopefully provide 38 percent of the country 's energy needs by the year 2020 .
on its own , germany has invested 43 million euros in solar energy in morocco , and the european union has pumped many millions more into the project .
as westerwelle is experiencing first-hand , involvement in moroccan politics is tricky business .
but the rewards are potentially very great .

he wants to talk about energy , but his hosts have put a different issue on the agenda . the western sahara is an important region for a variety of reasons .
the prevalence of sun makes it an ideal location for solar energy facilities , and the area is rich in phosphate .
the disputed territory is also the subject of a tug-of-war between morocco and the algerian backed sahrawi arab democratic republic -lrb- sadr -rrb- , which wants it to become an independent state .
when german foreign minister guido westerwelle arrived in the moroccan capital on monday for the first day of a three-day visit , he was confronted with the issue .
he chose his words with care .
“ the main thing is that everyone involved places their faith in negotiations and dialogue , ” westerwelle said .
“ what we want to communicate to our partners is the message of non-violence . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is having to tread lightly moroccan foreign minister taieb fassi fihri interpreted that statement as an expression of support for his government 's position vis-a-vis the sahrawi national liberation movement polisario and its algerian backers .
“ you have heard the german foreign minister , who said appeals to violence , such as those unfortunately issued by polisario and algeria , will not lead to a solution , ” fihri said .
“ we greatly value the statement that negotiations are the most important thing . ”
but it is unclear whether dialogue will be sufficient to resolve a conflict that has existed for decades .
fence sitting bildunterschrift : morocco and algeria both have interests in the region the western sahara was part of spain 's african colonies from the late nineteenth-century until 1975 , when the spanish withdrew , and both morocco and mauritania tried to annex the territory .
that drew resistance from polisario , the nationalist movement for the sahrawi , an arab-berber ethnic group of over 250,000 people , who claim to be the original inhabitants of the region .
by 1979 a campaign of violent resistance by polisario , with the backing of algeria , had forced mauritania from the western sahara .
morocco , however , expanded its control , and in 1991 , a un peace-keeping mission succeeded in establishing a ceasefire .
the un has recognized sadr as a representative of western saharans , and a referendum was planned to let them decide between independence or remaining part of morocco with increased autonomy .
that referendum has been stalled , though , for the past two decades .
bildunterschrift : the future of the sahrawi is up in the air morocco voted for germany to be given a two-year seat on the united nations security council .
now rabat would like a political favor in return .
“ we consulted with germany before we presented our autonomy plan , a plan of compromise that fulfills the criteria of the un security council , ” fihri said .
but polisario and algeria would like to see an independent western saharan state , and westerwelle was careful not to throw clear support in one direction or the other .
“ we are not taking sides in this question , ” westerwelle said .
“ we 're a conversation partner , and above all , we place our faith in the mediating role of the united nations . ”
indeed , in morocco , westerwelle is more interested in talking economics than politics .
here comes the sun morocco is one of the few countries in the arab world that does n't produce oil , and rabat is investing heavily in solar energy .
that represents a convergence of influence with germany , which has enormous technical expertise in that area .
bildunterschrift : solar energy is becoming more important in the middle east so westerwelle 's visit is also an opportunity to drum up some business in a country that has traditionally been oriented more toward spain and france .
“ we germans have top technology , and i 'm thinking especially of solar-energy technology , ” westerwelle said .
“ and in cooperation with morocco , we can use this solar technology particularly well .
that also represents a major chance for german companies to do business . ”
underscoring the tight connection between economics , energy and politics is the fact that the head of morocco 's one power utility , ali fassi fihri , is the moroccan foreign minister 's brother .
morocco is currently engaged in a massive solar-energy project that will cost $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euros -rrb- and hopefully provide 38 percent of the country 's energy needs by the year 2020 .
on its own , germany has invested 43 million euros in solar energy in morocco , and the european union has pumped many millions more into the project .
as westerwelle is experiencing first-hand , involvement in moroccan politics is tricky business .
but the rewards are potentially very great .

the delay could severely threaten the fledgling european diplomatic service , which is due to begin work on january 1 . the european union has failed to agree on a budget for 2011 , missing a self-imposed deadline of midnight on monday .
the deadlock centered on disagreements between the european parliament and representatives of the 27 member states ' national governments .
the breakdown came despite an existing consensus on the actual budget numbers .
last week , the european parliament bowed to pressure from national governments by agreeing to increase next year 's budget by only 2.9 percent , less than half of the increase that it had asked for .
but member states balked at parliament 's call for more power in shaping of budget over the next decade .
european parliament president jerzy buzek called the failure to agree on a new budget " bad news . "
new projects threaten funding difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be forced to operate next year using 2010 figures buzek indicated that " some member states " were to blame for the breakdown - particularly the united kingdom , sweden and the netherlands .
eu diplomats , however , said the parliament had made demands that had nothing to do with the new budget . the delay severely threatens planned institutions , including the european external action service -lrb- ead -rrb- , a new diplomatic service due to begin work at the start of next year , and the iter experimental nuclear reactor in southern france " this is an unfortunate failure , " said the chairman of the budget committee , alain lamassoure .
" but there are still a few weeks until the end of the year . "
the lawmakers are due to continue their talks on the 2011 budget and the future financing of the eu at next month 's summit , scheduled for december 16-17 . if a deal still can not be reached , the eu will be forced to operate using the 2010 budget on a monthly basis . the eu 's budget commissioner , janusz lewandowski , warned the warring sides not to gloss over the implications failing to reach consensus " i do n't want to be overdramatic ... but do not underestimate all the problems , " lewandowski said , adding that burden for subsidies due to be paid in january would fall to the member states . author : sarah harman -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he 's been called everything from ' visionary ' to germany 's ' most-hated manager ' .
now he 's been named ' european banker of the year . '
but the prestigious title has a troubled past . deutsche bank 's ceo josef ackermann has been one of the most looked-to figures of the german banking world throughout the financial crisis .
public perception of him fluctuates : he has been seen as a slick leader capable of leveraging money to get anything he wants , a punching bag to be held responsible for the consequences capitalism , and simply a profit-oriented manager with little social conscience .
but on monday , at the start of the euro finance week in frankfurt , ackermann found himself in the unaccustomed role of a media darling .
he was named " european banker of the year " by a panel of economic journalists who praised his leadership of deutsche bank during troubled times .
" with this prize we want to set a counterpoint to the public perception of josef ackermann in germany , " said hermann-josef knipper , deputy editor-in-chief of the business newspaper handelsblatt .
a persona such as ackermann 's could well be necessary to thrive in the world of international finance .
born in switzerland , ackermann became the first non-german chief executive officer of deutsche bank in 2006 .
since then he has cut loose industry holdings and some 20,000 employees .
a focus on private customers has been replaced with a concentration on larger and more lucrative clients .
in short , ackermann has made himself anything but popular in doing his job .
however , his circle of friends extends to the highest levels of german government .
in 2008 , his invitation from chancellor angela merkel to a dinner at the chancellery in berlin set off a flurry of media speculation about cronyism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquartered in frankfurt , deutsche bank maintains an international presence award has mixed history the european banker of the year title was first awarded in 1994 .
previous winners include high-profile policy-makers , such as jean-claude trichet of the european central bank and jean-claude juncker , the prime minister of luxembourg .
winners from the private sector , however , have been associated with scandal and misfortune .
peter wuffli of ubs won the award in 2005 , but two years later he was embarrassingly ousted from his position as ceo for taking excessive risks .
the royal bank of scotland 's fred goodwin – known as " fred the shred " for his aggressive job cutting strategy – won the award in 2003 , but stepped down from his position in 2008 after leading his bank into crisis .
udo steffens , president of the frankfurt school of finance , says ackermann deserves his award and is unlikely to suffer a similar fall from grace .
" ackermann , together with his management team , steered deutsche bank through the crisis relatively unscathed , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that is a very excellent feat of management . "
deutsche bank maintains an international presence like no other german bank , according to steffens .
" it 's vital for an industrialized nation like germany to have such a bank , " he said .
" despite all of the criticism , germans should be proud to have such a bank in their country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany may send nuclear waste to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste disposal is a divisive issue in germany germany is seeking to export 951 spent nuclear fuel rods , currently held at a temporary storage facility in the country 's west , to russia – but critics have called the plans dangerous and irresponsible . it may not be a universally popular move , but exporting nuclear waste is permitted under german law – on the condition that the destination country disposes the waste safely .
in fact , germany has sent shipments of nuclear waste to russia several times in the past .
up until 2009 , one firm regularly exported uranium hexafluoride , or uf6 , from a fuel rod treatment facility in gronau .
uf6 is a by-product created when uranium is enriched , and in order to avoid legal difficulties associated with disposing radioactive waste , the company rebranded its by-product as a resource to be sent to russia for processing .
the deliveries were stopped in 2009 , partly as a result of fierce protests .
now , the export of german nuclear waste to russia is back on the cards , as the german government considers an application to export 951 spent fuel rods to russia for disposal .
according to critics , however , the stakes may be higher this time around .
" we 're dealing with something different , " said tobias muenchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
greater fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian processing facility , mayak , was the site of one of the largest ever nuclear explosions muenchmeyer said that unlike uf6 , which is associated with low radiation levels , " we 're dealing with the spent nuclear fuel from a research reactor in germany , which , like all nuclear waste , also contains plutonium and other fission products and therefore represents incredibly dangerous cargo . "
the fuel rods , from a former east german research reactor near dresden , were originally imported from the soviet union in 1957 and were used until 1991 .
research reactors often use highly enriched material compared to most nuclear power plants – including material that can be used to make atom bombs .
russia and the united states have agreed to take back such waste in order to limit the spread of weapons-grade material and the german state of saxony , which owns the rods , is relying on that agreement to wash its hands of the matter .
because there is no interim storage facility in saxony , the fuel rods were moved in 2005 to ahaus in the state of north rhine-westphalia and saxony has been paying rent for their storage ever since .
" our position is clear , " a spokesperson for saxony 's science ministry said recently , " as long as international conditions are satisfied , then we want to see the material put back where it belongs . "
passing the rod as far as saxony is concerned , ' where it belongs ' is in a russian nuclear facility at mayak , some 150 km south-east of ekaterinburg .
for the opposition greens , though , mayak is anything but a safe repository .
" we know that mayak is highly contaminated , " said sylvia kotting-uhl , greens spokesperson for nuclear policy .
" we also know that mayak is not operated with anything like the same philosophy of safety that is considered standard here in germany .
so to move the waste fuel rods there is incredibly negligent . "
mayak – or ' lighthouse ' – is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union , and was also home , in 1957 , to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
some experts consider mayak 's environment to be more polluted than that of chernobyl , the site of the soviet union 's worst nuclear accident .
germany 's environment ministry , which confirmed that it had received an application to export the waste after press reports first uncovered the story last week , is responsible for determining whether such an export would be legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent transport of nuclear waste to gorleben , in northern germany , sparked mass protests setting a precedent an environment ministry spokesperson said that it would " only make a decision after careful consideration of questions over the safety of the russian site mayak . "
if the experts decide that mayak is safe , little will stand between the waste and its final repository .
the environment ministry has confirmed that a delivery contract has already been drawn up between germany and russia , ready to be signed .
this has left anti-nuclear groups and the opposition concerned , and only in part because they believe the 349 kilograms of plutonium will not be stored safely if they do make their way to mayak .
some fear the export could create a precedent , and encourage nations like russia to trade nuclear waste for cash .
greenpeace 's thomas muenchmeyer says that russians have extended such offers to accept waste in the past , but that " few of those have been official so far . "
he says south korea and taiwan are also potentially interested in such trades , but these are " still – thankfully - completely taboo in europe . "
the european union 's energy chief , guenther oettinger , recently announced plans to introduce a europe-wide ban on the export of nuclear waste .
the announcement was welcomed cautiously by anti-nuclear campaigners , who are concerned that it could contain loopholes when it comes to the export of ' resources ' like uf6 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent transport of nuclear waste to gorleben , in northern germany , sparked mass protests setting a precedent an environment ministry spokesperson said that it would " only make a decision after careful consideration of questions over the safety of the russian site mayak . "
if the experts decide that mayak is safe , little will stand between the waste and its final repository .
the environment ministry has confirmed that a delivery contract has already been drawn up between germany and russia , ready to be signed .
this has left anti-nuclear groups and the opposition concerned , and only in part because they believe the 349 kilograms of plutonium will not be stored safely if they do make their way to mayak .
some fear the export could create a precedent , and encourage nations like russia to trade nuclear waste for cash .
greenpeace 's thomas muenchmeyer says that russians have extended such offers to accept waste in the past , but that " few of those have been official so far . "
he says south korea and taiwan are also potentially interested in such trades , but these are " still – thankfully - completely taboo in europe . "
the european union 's energy chief , guenther oettinger , recently announced plans to introduce a europe-wide ban on the export of nuclear waste .
the announcement was welcomed cautiously by anti-nuclear campaigners , who are concerned that it could contain loopholes when it comes to the export of ' resources ' like uf6 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.11.2010 christian democrats vote in favor of embryo screening ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu voted to oppose the pre-screening of an embryo in order to check for diseases chancellor merkel 's cdu party has voted to ban pre-implantation genetic diagnosis , which could detect serious illnesses in embryos .
the party also wants to introduce stricter rules for foreigners who refuse to integrate . at its annual party conference , german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on tuesday voted to ban the screening of embryos used in ivf treatment .
a tight majority of 51 percent of the delegates voted to retain existing policy on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
policy from 2007 allows in vitro fertilization but makes it illegal to check the cells for hereditary diseases .
chancellor merkel had been pushing the ban in the run-up to the convention in karlsruhe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was among those who favor a ban " i favor a pgd ban because i am concerned that we can not define its limits properly , " merkel said on monday .
the issue is of key importance to the party as the cdu has , by definition , to uphold christian values .
according to mainstream christian teaching , life begins at conception .
deep divisions the party is however deeply divided over the issue , and the conference experienced an emotional debate lasting more than three hours .
for many , the memory of the nazis administering lethal injections to handicapped children forbids embryo screening in modern germany .
" if life is a gift from god , it is not given with any condition , " julia kloeckner , leader of cdu in the state of rhineland palatinate said .
" it would be disturbing for doctors to decide which embryos should be allowed to live by saying ' you 're okay , you 're not , " ' she added .
a lesser evil compared to still births and abortions but to delegates in favor of restricted pgd use , pre-screening would be the lesser evil compared to still births and abortions .
" there is a difference between an embryo before and after -lsb- implantation in the womb -rsb- has taken place , " said minister for family affairs kristina schroeder .
other cdu delegates agree .
according to peter hintze , deputy economics minister , it does not make sense that numerous examinations of the fetus inside the womb are allowed , but examinations of the embryo in a petri dish are not .
" pgd would not mean the creation of a designer baby , ” hintze , a protestant theologian , said .
" whoever believes the desire for a blue-eyed baby would lead anyone to undergo ivf , does not meet reality at all . "
jens spahn , cdu 's expert on health matters , did not believe that pre-screening techniques will be limited to serious diseases only .
legislation expected in july , the federal court of justice ruled that pgd is currently exempt from punishment .
in the coming weeks , the german parliament , the bundestag , will decide whether pgd should be banned by law .
tuesday ’ s decision might dissuade some cdu delegates from voting against the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded a debate on pgd justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the cdu 's coalition partner the fdp , criticized the decision and said a debate was needed in order to define strict guidelines for the use of pgd .
many of her party colleagues demand a limited usage of the technique .
other european nations such as britain , france , belgium and denmark already permit the screening .
integration policy the cdu also decided on stricter rules for foreigners who are not willing to integrate .
chancellor merkel recently declared multiculturalism to have failed and the conference agreed to pursue an integration policy that was in the " interests of germany " and an end to the " politics of misunderstood tolerance . "
" those rules are actually quite simple .
whoever wants to live here has to learn german .
whoever lives here has to respect our laws and values , " merkel said .
" those who do not follow the rules can expect to face sanctions . "

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .
" the last email which was sent -lsb- by police -rsb- told israilov to call the emergency number if needed … seven days later he was murdered . "
a witness silenced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israilov was a witness before the european court for human rights israilov filed charges against kadyrov after fleeing the chechen republic in 2006 , claiming to have witnessed killings and tortures conducted by kadyrov and his paramilitary forces .
he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .
the case was eventually dropped after israilov and his father disappeared into hiding and could n't be reached for further questioning .
israilov 's widow is reported to be living in austria with her four children .
his father , who is said to have fled europe in fear of his life , was expected to return to vienna for the court hearing under heavy security presence .

for wednesday 's match , germany 's coach has called up a quartet of dortmunders .
some may being staying in the national squad . on the one hand , it 's a mark of how confident joachim loew is that he 's omitted regulars like mesut oezil , thomas mueller and philipp lahm for the sweden match in goeteborg mid-week .
but a bit of additional quality in the squad is never unwelcome .
in the past , loew has called up young players as a reward for good performances in the domestic league - and as a way of securing their services for germany in future .
wednesday 's squad includes two debutees from dortmund , marcel schmelzer and mario goetze .
in addition , two of their teammates , mats hummels and kevin grosskreutz , are being capped for only the second time .
not every player who gets a call-up goes on to play a meaningful role in the national squad , of course , but each of these players have reason to hope wednesday wo n't be the last time they 'll be donning a germany jersey .
so who are these young players and what are their strengths and future prospects for germany ?
mats hummels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hummels is the bundesliga 's top-rated defender a product of bayern munich 's youth academy , 21-year-old mats hummels was allowed to move to dortmund in 2009 , and some in the bavarian capital probably regret letting him go .
except for a period when he was injured , the central defender has been a permanent part of coach juergen klopp 's starting line-up .
together with neven subotic , he heads the youngest and best defense in the bundesliga .
and central defense is one area that 's up in the air at the moment for the germany squad .
veteran arne friedrich and holger badstuber are currently out with nagging injuries , and neither per mertesacker nor heiko westermann have impressed this season .
at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

but success is all but sure . on sunday , us president barack obama and his cabinet launched a coordinated public relations blitz aimed at rallying support for the ratification of the nuclear disarmament pact washington had negotiated with moscow .
following a meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev on the sidelines of the apec economic summit in seoul , obama promised to get the us-russian nuclear arms reduction deal passed before the new congress takes office next year .
" i reiterated my commitment to get the start treaty done during the lame duck session , and i 've communicated to congress that it is a top priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original treaty was signed by george bush and mikhail gorbachev in 1991 one day later , on monday , us secretary of state , hillary clinton , and defense secretary robert gates followed up with a op-ed article in the washington post , urging congress to quickly ratify the so-called new start treaty - the successor of the original start initiated by president ronald reagan , which expired at the end of last year .
under the headline " we ca n't delay this treaty , " clinton and gates made the case for congress to pass the treaty , arguing that " our national security depends on it . " high stakes the full-court press by the obama administration highlights both the importance and the stakes for ratification of new start that would limit american and russian strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 respectively , and improve the verification regime .
but analysts are skeptical as to whether the joint appeal by obama , clinton and gates will be enough to persuade republicans to vote for the new start pact .
some republican lawmakers believe the treaty weakens the us , while others feel strongly that the newly elected senate should be given a chance to vote on the pact .
still others are loathe to give obama a victory in his lame-duck session , and are looking to renegotiate the treaty entirely . ratification requires a two-third majority , or 67 votes in the us senate .
democrats can command 59 votes in the current senate ; in the next senate they will only control 53 votes .
" i think it is doubtful that this extremely important step will be taken by the united states , " said karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at harvard university .
" the atmosphere of hostility and partisanship in the united states is such that the vote that the senate foreign relations committee took - where a majority actually voted in favor of the treaty - i do not think can be repeated .
even in a lame-duck session , ” kaiser told deutsche welle .
while some senior republican foreign-policy experts , such as richard lugar , support start and want to help get it passed , others want to renegotiate the deal or think a vote should be taken by the new congress .
political football ?
the treaty is a solid , if not overly ambitious agreement , and it should be ratified since it would increase us national security , argues patricia lewis , deputy director of the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratification will only become tougher when the new senate is sworn in " if it gets turned into political football between two parties in the country and has nothing to do with the larger and wider security issues then who is to know what will happen , " lewis told deutsche welle .
she added : " i really hope that it does get ratified and as soon as possible .
because right now there are no inspections on strategic weapons .
we want to move ahead with better and more wide-ranging cuts with the russians , and doing that if this is n't ratified would be very difficult . "
in light of its experience with the comprehensive test ban treaty , which moscow ratified and the us did n't , russia said this time around that it would only ratify new start after washington had done so .
therefore , according to kaiser , " a setback would also be very bad for the long-term goal of getting rid of all nuclear weapons and non-proliferation . "
and lewis said that if the us does n't ratify the treaty , " the trust in the united states as a negotiating partner , as a partner with whom you can do business , as a partner who can give their word and keep their word ... becomes further diminished .
that would be a real pity . "
europe 's role lewis and kaiser have different opinions as to how much influence europe and the rest of the world can have on the ratification of the treaty .
" i think the entire world will disagree if the treaty does n't get ratified because this is literally what everybody has wanted , " argues kaiser , who believes europe has n't done enough to support the ratification of the deal .
" it is not enough to simply agree with the vision of a non-nuclear world .
that 's very popular in europe .
nor is it enough to just argue you have to get rid of tactical nuclear weapons , as a number of europeans countries have done , " kaiser said .
according to kaiser , europe needs to give signals to the americans " at the highest political levels , notably the senate , " that the world expects american leadership in this matter .
but for her part , lewis is n't sure how useful it is to put more international pressure on the us .
" the united states is a democracy .
and this is very much a debate within the united states democracy , " she said . " it 's a debate for the senate to have .
i think there is a limit to which other countries can have a huge impact on domestic debates . "

the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

one of these writers is chinese nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo , currently incarcerated in china as a political prisoner . chosen as the winner of this year 's hermann kesten medal - a prize awarded annually by pen for outstanding efforts in support of persecuted authors - liu was eagerly awaited by a group of guests at the ceremony in the german city of darmstadt last week , but neither he nor his wife could attend , said the president of the german branch of pen , johano strasser . behind bars at this time , liu is serving time at a jail 450 kilometers north of beijing .
on december 25 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 11 years ' imprisonment on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power . liu was one of the creators of charter 08 - a manifesto initially signed in 2008 by over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in china .
the document currently has around 10,000 signatures and demands rights such as freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and the right to form political parties . tilman spengler , one of the ceremony 's hosts , pointed out that these demands are in full accordance with the chinese constitution , which , at least in theory , guarantees human rights . bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is passionate about advancing democracy and human rights in china theory and reality in china , those who , like liu , actively support human rights , are carefully scrutinized by the authorities .
since the nobel committee announced him as the winner of the peace prize in october , pressure on those who do n't follow the government line in china has increased .
numerous dissidents , including liu 's wife , are under house arrest , have faced interrogations or have been preemptively detained . the chinese government has been doing all it can to keep its citizens away from the nobel peace prize ceremony , which is due to be held on december 10 in oslo .
just recently , china 's authorities prevented liu 's lawyer mo shaoping from leaving the country on allegations of endangering national security .
according to geir lundestad , director of the norwegian nobel institute , it is likely that neither the diploma nor the medal can be awarded , since neither liu nor anyone associated with him will be allowed to attend . ' for the victims ' chinese author and president of the chinese pen center , tianchi martin-liao , accepted the hermann kesten prize on behalf of liu .
she was a logical choice for this role , as the two of them are friends and liu himself is a former president of pen in china . in her emotional acceptance speech , martin-liao described liu 's reaction to the news from the nobel committee .
according to her , the first sentence that the tearful liu uttered was , " this prize is for the victims of the 4th of june 1989 . " for liu , the chinese democratic movement and its brutal end at the tiananmen square massacre was a turning point .
he repeatedly said that he , as a survivor , felt a duty to fight for justice on behalf of those who had been killed in the incident . a mission this sense of duty led to liu 's imprisonment .
but despite the brutal measures taken against him , liu does not see himself as a victim , but rather as a person who was aware of the risks he was facing . " as soon as you have made your decision , you should have an optimistic stance towards the risk and the pressure , with self-confidence and calmness , " said liu in 2007 . in this regard , liu is a worthy recipient of the hermann kesten medal , which is endowed with 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,600 -rrb- .
hermann kesten himself was more famous for his support of other authors than for his writings - and for passionately standing up for persecuted artists in the nazi era . author : matthias von hein -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany may send nuclear waste to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste disposal is a divisive issue in germany germany is seeking to export 951 spent nuclear fuel rods , currently held at a temporary storage facility in the country 's west , to russia – but critics have called the plans dangerous and irresponsible . it may not be a universally popular move , but exporting nuclear waste is permitted under german law – on the condition that the destination country disposes the waste safely .
in fact , germany has sent shipments of nuclear waste to russia several times in the past .
up until 2009 , one firm regularly exported uranium hexafluoride , or uf6 , from a fuel rod treatment facility in gronau .
uf6 is a by-product created when uranium is enriched , and in order to avoid legal difficulties associated with disposing radioactive waste , the company rebranded its by-product as a resource to be sent to russia for processing .
the deliveries were stopped in 2009 , partly as a result of fierce protests .
now , the export of german nuclear waste to russia is back on the cards , as the german government considers an application to export 951 spent fuel rods to russia for disposal .
according to critics , however , the stakes may be higher this time around .
" we 're dealing with something different , " said tobias muenchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
greater fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian processing facility , mayak , was the site of one of the largest ever nuclear explosions muenchmeyer said that unlike uf6 , which is associated with low radiation levels , " we 're dealing with the spent nuclear fuel from a research reactor in germany , which , like all nuclear waste , also contains plutonium and other fission products and therefore represents incredibly dangerous cargo . "
the fuel rods , from a former east german research reactor near dresden , were originally imported from the soviet union in 1957 and were used until 1991 .
research reactors often use highly enriched material compared to most nuclear power plants – including material that can be used to make atom bombs .
russia and the united states have agreed to take back such waste in order to limit the spread of weapons-grade material and the german state of saxony , which owns the rods , is relying on that agreement to wash its hands of the matter .
because there is no interim storage facility in saxony , the fuel rods were moved in 2005 to ahaus in the state of north rhine-westphalia and saxony has been paying rent for their storage ever since .
" our position is clear , " a spokesperson for saxony 's science ministry said recently , " as long as international conditions are satisfied , then we want to see the material put back where it belongs . "
passing the rod as far as saxony is concerned , ' where it belongs ' is in a russian nuclear facility at mayak , some 150 km south-east of ekaterinburg .
for the opposition greens , though , mayak is anything but a safe repository .
" we know that mayak is highly contaminated , " said sylvia kotting-uhl , greens spokesperson for nuclear policy .
" we also know that mayak is not operated with anything like the same philosophy of safety that is considered standard here in germany .
so to move the waste fuel rods there is incredibly negligent . "
mayak – or ' lighthouse ' – is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union , and was also home , in 1957 , to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
some experts consider mayak 's environment to be more polluted than that of chernobyl , the site of the soviet union 's worst nuclear accident .
germany 's environment ministry , which confirmed that it had received an application to export the waste after press reports first uncovered the story last week , is responsible for determining whether such an export would be legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent transport of nuclear waste to gorleben , in northern germany , sparked mass protests setting a precedent an environment ministry spokesperson said that it would " only make a decision after careful consideration of questions over the safety of the russian site mayak . "
if the experts decide that mayak is safe , little will stand between the waste and its final repository .
the environment ministry has confirmed that a delivery contract has already been drawn up between germany and russia , ready to be signed .
this has left anti-nuclear groups and the opposition concerned , and only in part because they believe the 349 kilograms of plutonium will not be stored safely if they do make their way to mayak .
some fear the export could create a precedent , and encourage nations like russia to trade nuclear waste for cash .
greenpeace 's thomas muenchmeyer says that russians have extended such offers to accept waste in the past , but that " few of those have been official so far . "
he says south korea and taiwan are also potentially interested in such trades , but these are " still – thankfully - completely taboo in europe . "
the european union 's energy chief , guenther oettinger , recently announced plans to introduce a europe-wide ban on the export of nuclear waste .
the announcement was welcomed cautiously by anti-nuclear campaigners , who are concerned that it could contain loopholes when it comes to the export of ' resources ' like uf6 .

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen says ireland will be just fine for another year under pressure ewald nowotny , a member of the european central bank 's governing council , said the european union wanted a " quick , good solution to ireland , so that there would be no spill-over " to other heavily indebted countries such as portugal and spain .
ireland has come under pressure from eurozone leaders , who fear the country 's debt crisis could bring down the rest of the bloc .
debt is widespread in the eurozone and the eu , but ireland is currently seen as the weakest link .
portugal also in trouble meanwhile , portugal , which is already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , admitted on monday it was in difficulty , but portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said there were no plans as of yet for lisbon to request emergency funding .
at their monthly meeting in brussels , the eurozone finance ministers are also expected to discuss the future eurozone crisis resolution mechanism , which germany wants to start from 2013 , replacing the 440-billion-euro european financial stability facility set up after greece sought help in may .
the ministers are also expected to praise ireland 's 2011 budget cuts , which face a parliamentary vote of approval next month .
meanwhile , in ireland , finance minister brian lenihan is expected to release details of a new four-year debt-cutting program before the end of the month .

he 's been called everything from ' visionary ' to germany 's ' most-hated manager ' .
now he 's been named ' european banker of the year . '
but the prestigious title has a troubled past . deutsche bank 's ceo josef ackermann has been one of the most looked-to figures of the german banking world throughout the financial crisis .
public perception of him fluctuates : he has been seen as a slick leader capable of leveraging money to get anything he wants , a punching bag to be held responsible for the consequences capitalism , and simply a profit-oriented manager with little social conscience .
but on monday , at the start of the euro finance week in frankfurt , ackermann found himself in the unaccustomed role of a media darling .
he was named " european banker of the year " by a panel of economic journalists who praised his leadership of deutsche bank during troubled times .
" with this prize we want to set a counterpoint to the public perception of josef ackermann in germany , " said hermann-josef knipper , deputy editor-in-chief of the business newspaper handelsblatt .
a persona such as ackermann 's could well be necessary to thrive in the world of international finance .
born in switzerland , ackermann became the first non-german chief executive officer of deutsche bank in 2006 .
since then he has cut loose industry holdings and some 20,000 employees .
a focus on private customers has been replaced with a concentration on larger and more lucrative clients .
in short , ackermann has made himself anything but popular in doing his job .
however , his circle of friends extends to the highest levels of german government .
in 2008 , his invitation from chancellor angela merkel to a dinner at the chancellery in berlin set off a flurry of media speculation about cronyism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquartered in frankfurt , deutsche bank maintains an international presence award has mixed history the european banker of the year title was first awarded in 1994 .
previous winners include high-profile policy-makers , such as jean-claude trichet of the european central bank and jean-claude juncker , the prime minister of luxembourg .
winners from the private sector , however , have been associated with scandal and misfortune .
peter wuffli of ubs won the award in 2005 , but two years later he was embarrassingly ousted from his position as ceo for taking excessive risks .
the royal bank of scotland 's fred goodwin – known as " fred the shred " for his aggressive job cutting strategy – won the award in 2003 , but stepped down from his position in 2008 after leading his bank into crisis .
udo steffens , president of the frankfurt school of finance , says ackermann deserves his award and is unlikely to suffer a similar fall from grace .
" ackermann , together with his management team , steered deutsche bank through the crisis relatively unscathed , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that is a very excellent feat of management . "
deutsche bank maintains an international presence like no other german bank , according to steffens .
" it 's vital for an industrialized nation like germany to have such a bank , " he said .
" despite all of the criticism , germans should be proud to have such a bank in their country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 16.11.2010 solar energy , regional politics dominate discussion between germany and morocco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moroccan capital rabat is the site of bilateral german-moroccan talks german foreign minister guido westerwelle is spending the early part of this week in morocco .
he wants to talk about energy , but his hosts have put a different issue on the agenda . the western sahara is an important region for a variety of reasons .
the prevalence of sun makes it an ideal location for solar energy facilities , and the area is rich in phosphate .
the disputed territory is also the subject of a tug-of-war between morocco and the algerian backed sahrawi arab democratic republic -lrb- sadr -rrb- , which wants it to become an independent state .
when german foreign minister guido westerwelle arrived in the moroccan capital on monday for the first day of a three-day visit , he was confronted with the issue .
he chose his words with care .
“ the main thing is that everyone involved places their faith in negotiations and dialogue , ” westerwelle said .
“ what we want to communicate to our partners is the message of non-violence . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is having to tread lightly moroccan foreign minister taieb fassi fihri interpreted that statement as an expression of support for his government 's position vis-a-vis the sahrawi national liberation movement polisario and its algerian backers .
“ you have heard the german foreign minister , who said appeals to violence , such as those unfortunately issued by polisario and algeria , will not lead to a solution , ” fihri said .
“ we greatly value the statement that negotiations are the most important thing . ”
but it is unclear whether dialogue will be sufficient to resolve a conflict that has existed for decades .
fence sitting bildunterschrift : morocco and algeria both have interests in the region the western sahara was part of spain 's african colonies from the late nineteenth-century until 1975 , when the spanish withdrew , and both morocco and mauritania tried to annex the territory .
that drew resistance from polisario , the nationalist movement for the sahrawi , an arab-berber ethnic group of over 250,000 people , who claim to be the original inhabitants of the region .
by 1979 a campaign of violent resistance by polisario , with the backing of algeria , had forced mauritania from the western sahara .
morocco , however , expanded its control , and in 1991 , a un peace-keeping mission succeeded in establishing a ceasefire .
the un has recognized sadr as a representative of western saharans , and a referendum was planned to let them decide between independence or remaining part of morocco with increased autonomy .
that referendum has been stalled , though , for the past two decades .
bildunterschrift : the future of the sahrawi is up in the air morocco voted for germany to be given a two-year seat on the united nations security council .
now rabat would like a political favor in return .
“ we consulted with germany before we presented our autonomy plan , a plan of compromise that fulfills the criteria of the un security council , ” fihri said .
but polisario and algeria would like to see an independent western saharan state , and westerwelle was careful not to throw clear support in one direction or the other .
“ we are not taking sides in this question , ” westerwelle said .
“ we 're a conversation partner , and above all , we place our faith in the mediating role of the united nations . ”
indeed , in morocco , westerwelle is more interested in talking economics than politics .
here comes the sun morocco is one of the few countries in the arab world that does n't produce oil , and rabat is investing heavily in solar energy .
that represents a convergence of influence with germany , which has enormous technical expertise in that area .
bildunterschrift : solar energy is becoming more important in the middle east so westerwelle 's visit is also an opportunity to drum up some business in a country that has traditionally been oriented more toward spain and france .
“ we germans have top technology , and i 'm thinking especially of solar-energy technology , ” westerwelle said .
“ and in cooperation with morocco , we can use this solar technology particularly well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 16.11.2010 solar energy , regional politics dominate discussion between germany and morocco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moroccan capital rabat is the site of bilateral german-moroccan talks german foreign minister guido westerwelle is spending the early part of this week in morocco .
he wants to talk about energy , but his hosts have put a different issue on the agenda . the western sahara is an important region for a variety of reasons .
the prevalence of sun makes it an ideal location for solar energy facilities , and the area is rich in phosphate .
the disputed territory is also the subject of a tug-of-war between morocco and the algerian backed sahrawi arab democratic republic -lrb- sadr -rrb- , which wants it to become an independent state .
when german foreign minister guido westerwelle arrived in the moroccan capital on monday for the first day of a three-day visit , he was confronted with the issue .
he chose his words with care .
“ the main thing is that everyone involved places their faith in negotiations and dialogue , ” westerwelle said .
“ what we want to communicate to our partners is the message of non-violence . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is having to tread lightly moroccan foreign minister taieb fassi fihri interpreted that statement as an expression of support for his government 's position vis-a-vis the sahrawi national liberation movement polisario and its algerian backers .
“ you have heard the german foreign minister , who said appeals to violence , such as those unfortunately issued by polisario and algeria , will not lead to a solution , ” fihri said .
“ we greatly value the statement that negotiations are the most important thing . ”
but it is unclear whether dialogue will be sufficient to resolve a conflict that has existed for decades .
fence sitting bildunterschrift : morocco and algeria both have interests in the region the western sahara was part of spain 's african colonies from the late nineteenth-century until 1975 , when the spanish withdrew , and both morocco and mauritania tried to annex the territory .
that drew resistance from polisario , the nationalist movement for the sahrawi , an arab-berber ethnic group of over 250,000 people , who claim to be the original inhabitants of the region .
by 1979 a campaign of violent resistance by polisario , with the backing of algeria , had forced mauritania from the western sahara .
morocco , however , expanded its control , and in 1991 , a un peace-keeping mission succeeded in establishing a ceasefire .
the un has recognized sadr as a representative of western saharans , and a referendum was planned to let them decide between independence or remaining part of morocco with increased autonomy .
that referendum has been stalled , though , for the past two decades .
bildunterschrift : the future of the sahrawi is up in the air morocco voted for germany to be given a two-year seat on the united nations security council .
now rabat would like a political favor in return .
“ we consulted with germany before we presented our autonomy plan , a plan of compromise that fulfills the criteria of the un security council , ” fihri said .
but polisario and algeria would like to see an independent western saharan state , and westerwelle was careful not to throw clear support in one direction or the other .
“ we are not taking sides in this question , ” westerwelle said .
“ we 're a conversation partner , and above all , we place our faith in the mediating role of the united nations . ”
indeed , in morocco , westerwelle is more interested in talking economics than politics .
here comes the sun morocco is one of the few countries in the arab world that does n't produce oil , and rabat is investing heavily in solar energy .
that represents a convergence of influence with germany , which has enormous technical expertise in that area .
bildunterschrift : solar energy is becoming more important in the middle east so westerwelle 's visit is also an opportunity to drum up some business in a country that has traditionally been oriented more toward spain and france .
“ we germans have top technology , and i 'm thinking especially of solar-energy technology , ” westerwelle said .
“ and in cooperation with morocco , we can use this solar technology particularly well .
that also represents a major chance for german companies to do business . ”
underscoring the tight connection between economics , energy and politics is the fact that the head of morocco 's one power utility , ali fassi fihri , is the moroccan foreign minister 's brother .
morocco is currently engaged in a massive solar-energy project that will cost $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euros -rrb- and hopefully provide 38 percent of the country 's energy needs by the year 2020 .

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .
" the last email which was sent -lsb- by police -rsb- told israilov to call the emergency number if needed … seven days later he was murdered . "
a witness silenced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israilov was a witness before the european court for human rights israilov filed charges against kadyrov after fleeing the chechen republic in 2006 , claiming to have witnessed killings and tortures conducted by kadyrov and his paramilitary forces .
he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .
the case was eventually dropped after israilov and his father disappeared into hiding and could n't be reached for further questioning .
israilov 's widow is reported to be living in austria with her four children .
his father , who is said to have fled europe in fear of his life , was expected to return to vienna for the court hearing under heavy security presence .

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .

handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disarmament -pipe- 16.11.2010 white house pushes for start , but ratification remains uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the start treaty would cut us and russian nuclear arsenals with ratification of the new start treaty only likely to be more difficult when the next congress takes office in 2011 , the white house is pushing for a vote in the lame-duck senate .
but success is all but sure . on sunday , us president barack obama and his cabinet launched a coordinated public relations blitz aimed at rallying support for the ratification of the nuclear disarmament pact washington had negotiated with moscow .
following a meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev on the sidelines of the apec economic summit in seoul , obama promised to get the us-russian nuclear arms reduction deal passed before the new congress takes office next year .
" i reiterated my commitment to get the start treaty done during the lame duck session , and i 've communicated to congress that it is a top priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original treaty was signed by george bush and mikhail gorbachev in 1991 one day later , on monday , us secretary of state , hillary clinton , and defense secretary robert gates followed up with a op-ed article in the washington post , urging congress to quickly ratify the so-called new start treaty - the successor of the original start initiated by president ronald reagan , which expired at the end of last year .
under the headline " we ca n't delay this treaty , " clinton and gates made the case for congress to pass the treaty , arguing that " our national security depends on it . " high stakes the full-court press by the obama administration highlights both the importance and the stakes for ratification of new start that would limit american and russian strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 respectively , and improve the verification regime .
but analysts are skeptical as to whether the joint appeal by obama , clinton and gates will be enough to persuade republicans to vote for the new start pact .
some republican lawmakers believe the treaty weakens the us , while others feel strongly that the newly elected senate should be given a chance to vote on the pact .
still others are loathe to give obama a victory in his lame-duck session , and are looking to renegotiate the treaty entirely . ratification requires a two-third majority , or 67 votes in the us senate .
democrats can command 59 votes in the current senate ; in the next senate they will only control 53 votes .
" i think it is doubtful that this extremely important step will be taken by the united states , " said karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at harvard university .
" the atmosphere of hostility and partisanship in the united states is such that the vote that the senate foreign relations committee took - where a majority actually voted in favor of the treaty - i do not think can be repeated .
even in a lame-duck session , ” kaiser told deutsche welle .
while some senior republican foreign-policy experts , such as richard lugar , support start and want to help get it passed , others want to renegotiate the deal or think a vote should be taken by the new congress .
political football ?
the treaty is a solid , if not overly ambitious agreement , and it should be ratified since it would increase us national security , argues patricia lewis , deputy director of the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratification will only become tougher when the new senate is sworn in " if it gets turned into political football between two parties in the country and has nothing to do with the larger and wider security issues then who is to know what will happen , " lewis told deutsche welle .
she added : " i really hope that it does get ratified and as soon as possible .
because right now there are no inspections on strategic weapons .
we want to move ahead with better and more wide-ranging cuts with the russians , and doing that if this is n't ratified would be very difficult . "
in light of its experience with the comprehensive test ban treaty , which moscow ratified and the us did n't , russia said this time around that it would only ratify new start after washington had done so .
therefore , according to kaiser , " a setback would also be very bad for the long-term goal of getting rid of all nuclear weapons and non-proliferation . "
and lewis said that if the us does n't ratify the treaty , " the trust in the united states as a negotiating partner , as a partner with whom you can do business , as a partner who can give their word and keep their word ... becomes further diminished .
that would be a real pity . "
europe 's role lewis and kaiser have different opinions as to how much influence europe and the rest of the world can have on the ratification of the treaty .
" i think the entire world will disagree if the treaty does n't get ratified because this is literally what everybody has wanted , " argues kaiser , who believes europe has n't done enough to support the ratification of the deal .
" it is not enough to simply agree with the vision of a non-nuclear world .
that 's very popular in europe .
nor is it enough to just argue you have to get rid of tactical nuclear weapons , as a number of europeans countries have done , " kaiser said .
according to kaiser , europe needs to give signals to the americans " at the highest political levels , notably the senate , " that the world expects american leadership in this matter .
but for her part , lewis is n't sure how useful it is to put more international pressure on the us .
" the united states is a democracy .
and this is very much a debate within the united states democracy , " she said . " it 's a debate for the senate to have .
i think there is a limit to which other countries can have a huge impact on domestic debates . "

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .

and some are wondering if the social network 's privacy policies are strong enough . at a press conference in san francisco , california on monday , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg unveiled the latest of the social networking platform ’ s innovations , facebook messages .
with this announcement , facebook , which counts more than 500 million users , is pushing into google 's turf with this e-mail-like service .
although zuckerberg would be quick to say messages is not e-mail , facebook users will have an @ facebook.com address once the system is released , so it definitely looks similar .
one of the features of messages highlighted in the press conference is its archival function , basically storing all records of messages sent between parties .
given some of facebook 's history with privacy issues , this feature could create some discomfort for less public users .
a digital shoebox facebook 's messaging system has always been integral to the platform , providing users with a slightly less public forum for discussion than publishing everything on " facebook walls , " the bulletin boards that display the activities of a user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook 's latest plans have created a media stir with messages , zuckerberg says the concept is to " flatten " the landscape of communication .
teens , he said at the press conference , prefer sms over e-mail because the latter is too slow , whereas others strictly use e-mail or instant messaging to talk to their friends and family .
so facebook intends to use messages to aggregate these three different means of communication into one conversation .
one user may send an sms , another might reply with an e-mail , but both messages appear on facebook as part of a conversation .
the result , facebook says , will be a continuous collection of conversation history between friends .
the image used in promotional material by facebook is that messages will be analogous to the boxes of letters people once used to collect and cherish , as a way to remember the course of a relationship .
but what about privacy ?
as the new system is gradually rolled out , users will be able to send and receive e-mails with their new @ facebook.com e-mail address .
at first , facebook users will only receive mail from their facebook friends , with all other mail going into an other or a junk mail folder .
but users may " promote " mail from these folders to their primary folders if they wish .
the conversation history will be stored on facebook , which could raise security concerns for some .
when asked about an option for " off the record " conversations at the press conference , zuckerberg responded that users would have the option to delete threads or messages , but that " off the record " does n't make sense .
in the past , facebook has weathered criticism for some of the wording in their terms of use , which in february 2009 , briefly seemed to state that facebook would own any content a user uploaded to the public site , in perpetuity .
facebook and zuckerberg quickly moved to douse the flames of public outcry and released a new terms of use with the section on privacy right up at the top which states , " you own all of the content and information you post on facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings .

the eu 's economy commissioner said the bloc was in talks with the imf on tackling problems in the irish banking sector . the european union on tuesday announced it is in talks with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- about taking on growing problems in ireland 's banking sector .
eu economy commissioner olli rehn said ahead of a meeting with eurozone finance ministers in brussels that ireland 's banking crisis was " the most pressing problem " facing the monetary union . meanwhile , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who headed tuesday 's talks by the panel of financial ministers known as the eurogroup , vowed to protect the 16-nation euro currency . juncker urged that the irish government would have to decide on financial aid , with inevitable strings attached , within days .
however , he stressed that no aid could be given if ireland did not request it . " the discussions that will take place between ireland and the -lsb- european -rsb- commission and the ecb and the imf will enable us to have at our disposal all the elements and instruments we need were ireland to make a request for assistance to the eu , the imf and the europgroup , " juncker told reporters . euro ' not threatened ' solvency concerns have grown in ireland after a 45 billion euro -lrb- $ 61 billion -rrb- bailout for private banks increased its deficit in 2010 to 32 percent of gross domestic product .
however , rehn also pointed out that the crisis in ireland was limited to its banking sector , and that the government was " funded well until the middle of next year . "

the party also wants to introduce stricter rules for foreigners who refuse to integrate . at its annual party conference , german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on tuesday voted to ban the screening of embryos used in ivf treatment .
a tight majority of 51 percent of the delegates voted to retain existing policy on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
policy from 2007 allows in vitro fertilization but makes it illegal to check the cells for hereditary diseases .
chancellor merkel had been pushing the ban in the run-up to the convention in karlsruhe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was among those who favor a ban " i favor a pgd ban because i am concerned that we can not define its limits properly , " merkel said on monday .
the issue is of key importance to the party as the cdu has , by definition , to uphold christian values .
according to mainstream christian teaching , life begins at conception .
deep divisions the party is however deeply divided over the issue , and the conference experienced an emotional debate lasting more than three hours .
for many , the memory of the nazis administering lethal injections to handicapped children forbids embryo screening in modern germany .
" if life is a gift from god , it is not given with any condition , " julia kloeckner , leader of cdu in the state of rhineland palatinate said .
" it would be disturbing for doctors to decide which embryos should be allowed to live by saying ' you 're okay , you 're not , " ' she added .
a lesser evil compared to still births and abortions but to delegates in favor of restricted pgd use , pre-screening would be the lesser evil compared to still births and abortions .
" there is a difference between an embryo before and after -lsb- implantation in the womb -rsb- has taken place , " said minister for family affairs kristina schroeder .
other cdu delegates agree .
according to peter hintze , deputy economics minister , it does not make sense that numerous examinations of the fetus inside the womb are allowed , but examinations of the embryo in a petri dish are not .
" pgd would not mean the creation of a designer baby , ” hintze , a protestant theologian , said .
" whoever believes the desire for a blue-eyed baby would lead anyone to undergo ivf , does not meet reality at all . "
jens spahn , cdu 's expert on health matters , did not believe that pre-screening techniques will be limited to serious diseases only .
legislation expected in july , the federal court of justice ruled that pgd is currently exempt from punishment .
in the coming weeks , the german parliament , the bundestag , will decide whether pgd should be banned by law .
tuesday ’ s decision might dissuade some cdu delegates from voting against the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded a debate on pgd justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the cdu 's coalition partner the fdp , criticized the decision and said a debate was needed in order to define strict guidelines for the use of pgd .
many of her party colleagues demand a limited usage of the technique .
other european nations such as britain , france , belgium and denmark already permit the screening .
integration policy the cdu also decided on stricter rules for foreigners who are not willing to integrate .
chancellor merkel recently declared multiculturalism to have failed and the conference agreed to pursue an integration policy that was in the " interests of germany " and an end to the " politics of misunderstood tolerance . "
" those rules are actually quite simple .
whoever wants to live here has to learn german .
whoever lives here has to respect our laws and values , " merkel said .
" those who do not follow the rules can expect to face sanctions . "

the delay could severely threaten the fledgling european diplomatic service , which is due to begin work on january 1 . the european union has failed to agree on a budget for 2011 , missing a self-imposed deadline of midnight on monday .
the deadlock centered on disagreements between the european parliament and representatives of the 27 member states ' national governments .
the breakdown came despite an existing consensus on the actual budget numbers .
last week , the european parliament bowed to pressure from national governments by agreeing to increase next year 's budget by only 2.9 percent , less than half of the increase that it had asked for .
but member states balked at parliament 's call for more power in shaping of budget over the next decade .
european parliament president jerzy buzek called the failure to agree on a new budget " bad news . "
new projects threaten funding difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be forced to operate next year using 2010 figures buzek indicated that " some member states " were to blame for the breakdown - particularly the united kingdom , sweden and the netherlands .
eu diplomats , however , said the parliament had made demands that had nothing to do with the new budget . the delay severely threatens planned institutions , including the european external action service -lrb- ead -rrb- , a new diplomatic service due to begin work at the start of next year , and the iter experimental nuclear reactor in southern france " this is an unfortunate failure , " said the chairman of the budget committee , alain lamassoure .
" but there are still a few weeks until the end of the year . "
the lawmakers are due to continue their talks on the 2011 budget and the future financing of the eu at next month 's summit , scheduled for december 16-17 . if a deal still can not be reached , the eu will be forced to operate using the 2010 budget on a monthly basis . the eu 's budget commissioner , janusz lewandowski , warned the warring sides not to gloss over the implications failing to reach consensus " i do n't want to be overdramatic ... but do not underestimate all the problems , " lewandowski said , adding that burden for subsidies due to be paid in january would fall to the member states . author : sarah harman -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in today ’ s segment he explains how fast a shopping mall can be turned into a prayer room . i 'm now wearing official hajj attire !
and i 'm curious to get reactions about how i look in my new outfit .
so please check out my pictures .
i ’ m pretty sure it will get a smile out of some of my friends and readers .
but that 's okay , because in my opinion , islam should also be about humor and the joy of life . here in mecca , i experience humor and the joy of life every day – even in the middle of huge crowds of people .
during a bus trip with pilgrims from austria , italy , brazil , and china all of us had some time to joke around in english which is our common language here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying pilgrims it reminds me of my time as a student in damascus , where i and other international students lived with an arabic-catholic family .
of course , here all of us are muslims and the atmosphere is quite spiritual .
the other pilgrims are praying to god , they 're praying in the bus even when it turns a sharp corner .
but every once in a while during the ride we just shoot the breeze . today is the feast of sacrifice – the day when muslims commemorate prophet ibrahim -lrb- abraham -rrb- , who 's also worshiped by christians and jews .
according to islamic tradition , he was willing to sacrifice his son to god .
but god refused his offering and a lamb was sacrificed instead .
the story lead to a religious ritual : every believing muslim who can afford it is supposed to sacrifice an animal on the feast of sacrifice and then give its meat to the hungry and the poor .
in mecca , as you can imagine , this is taking place on a large scale . prayers in the shopping mall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali almakhlafi at the kaaba but let me tell you about another intriguing sight i came across at the al-haram mosque .
right next to it , you can now find what is said to be the largest clock in the world .
it 's more than 600 meters high .
it 's absolutely breathtaking – i really have never seen anything like it in my entire life ! equally astonishing to me was the fact there ’ s starbucks coffee shop just next to the kaaba .
also close by are a number of shopping malls and if the mosque is full , pilgrims simply venture over to shopping malls to pray . in one of those malls , i met layali and farid – a couple from vienna .
for layali it ’ s her second hajj and she 's really excited about it .
in the middle of all the glittering shops and stores of the mall she tells me : " material things have no relevance here .
you really feel close to god and you understand how small you really are in relation to it all . "
after telling me that , she does n't want to give any more interviews close to the kaaba : " i want to focus on god exclusively . " i understand that , of course .
instead , i turn to farid who says he has found his spiritual home at mecca , but adds that " i 'm a real austrian – austria is my homeland . "
moments later , layali and farid vanish in the crowd . sleepless in mecca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at namira mosque in arafat make no mistake , a pilgrimage is not a cakewalk .
last night i have been up and awake the whole night . the day before , pilgrims prayed at the mountain of forgiveness and then travelled to mina in order to collect stones for the symbolic stoning of the devil . all of that made me think about a question posted by dw user thomas pudelko , who said that he had heard that the technical infrastructure in mecca has been built with german support and asked whether this had a negative impact on the spiritual atmosphere . no , i really do n't think it does .
the spiritual atmosphere is very intense and very impressive .
and many people i meet say that the security has really gotten a lot better with the help of german engineers . in muzdalifah , the only stage of the hajj where pilgrims spend their night outside , i dearly missed “ good old german " organizational skills : it took us a three hours to get only a couple of kilometers ahead .
and when we arrived , there was complete and utter chaos with hundreds of thousands of people running around aimlessly all over the place .
even worse , an old man got hit by a bus .
i only hope he survived ! answering the dw users " how do you find your way through the crowd ? " asked dw english user sandhya moirangthem .
that 's a good question , sandhya .
i was n't really sure myself before i got here , but i learned pretty quickly .
most of the time the old rule applies : just follow the crowd . on the facebook page of dw arabic , yuir boston asked me to describe the life and daily routine in mecca apart from the hajj .
dear yuri , besides the area of the kaaba mosque , a lot of the places and hajj-sites are abandoned and empty for most of the year – there 's simply no one there , only the desert .
i will describe the daily routine in saudi arabia in more detail after my return . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is supposedly the world 's largest clock how do saudi authorities make sure there are only muslims attending the hajj is a question posted by dw user " derks145 " .
well , you need a special hajj-visa in order to get here in the first place .
in most cases , you can tell the muslim background by the names , too .
whenever there are any doubts , saudi authorities also ask for proof in the form of certificates issued , for example , by a muslim community . and here 's one more question posted by user judith puppe from germany : " how much is the hajj for muslims ? "
well , i asked around and suppose it 's about 3000 euros .
but i 'm not sure about that really . after not sleeping any last night , i will now attend the feast of sacrifice and the symbolic stoning of the devil .
what ’ s more , pilgrims will also have their hair cut .

in today ’ s segment he explains how fast a shopping mall can be turned into a prayer room . i 'm now wearing official hajj attire !
and i 'm curious to get reactions about how i look in my new outfit .
so please check out my pictures .
i ’ m pretty sure it will get a smile out of some of my friends and readers .
but that 's okay , because in my opinion , islam should also be about humor and the joy of life . here in mecca , i experience humor and the joy of life every day – even in the middle of huge crowds of people .
during a bus trip with pilgrims from austria , italy , brazil , and china all of us had some time to joke around in english which is our common language here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying pilgrims it reminds me of my time as a student in damascus , where i and other international students lived with an arabic-catholic family .
of course , here all of us are muslims and the atmosphere is quite spiritual .
the other pilgrims are praying to god , they 're praying in the bus even when it turns a sharp corner .
but every once in a while during the ride we just shoot the breeze . today is the feast of sacrifice – the day when muslims commemorate prophet ibrahim -lrb- abraham -rrb- , who 's also worshiped by christians and jews .
according to islamic tradition , he was willing to sacrifice his son to god .
but god refused his offering and a lamb was sacrificed instead .
the story lead to a religious ritual : every believing muslim who can afford it is supposed to sacrifice an animal on the feast of sacrifice and then give its meat to the hungry and the poor .
in mecca , as you can imagine , this is taking place on a large scale . prayers in the shopping mall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali almakhlafi at the kaaba but let me tell you about another intriguing sight i came across at the al-haram mosque .
right next to it , you can now find what is said to be the largest clock in the world .
it 's more than 600 meters high .
it 's absolutely breathtaking – i really have never seen anything like it in my entire life ! equally astonishing to me was the fact there ’ s starbucks coffee shop just next to the kaaba .
also close by are a number of shopping malls and if the mosque is full , pilgrims simply venture over to shopping malls to pray . in one of those malls , i met layali and farid – a couple from vienna .
for layali it ’ s her second hajj and she 's really excited about it .
in the middle of all the glittering shops and stores of the mall she tells me : " material things have no relevance here .
you really feel close to god and you understand how small you really are in relation to it all . "
after telling me that , she does n't want to give any more interviews close to the kaaba : " i want to focus on god exclusively . " i understand that , of course .
instead , i turn to farid who says he has found his spiritual home at mecca , but adds that " i 'm a real austrian – austria is my homeland . "
moments later , layali and farid vanish in the crowd . sleepless in mecca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at namira mosque in arafat make no mistake , a pilgrimage is not a cakewalk .

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 16.11.2010 solar energy , regional politics dominate discussion between germany and morocco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moroccan capital rabat is the site of bilateral german-moroccan talks german foreign minister guido westerwelle is spending the early part of this week in morocco .
he wants to talk about energy , but his hosts have put a different issue on the agenda . the western sahara is an important region for a variety of reasons .
the prevalence of sun makes it an ideal location for solar energy facilities , and the area is rich in phosphate .
the disputed territory is also the subject of a tug-of-war between morocco and the algerian backed sahrawi arab democratic republic -lrb- sadr -rrb- , which wants it to become an independent state .
when german foreign minister guido westerwelle arrived in the moroccan capital on monday for the first day of a three-day visit , he was confronted with the issue .
he chose his words with care .
“ the main thing is that everyone involved places their faith in negotiations and dialogue , ” westerwelle said .
“ what we want to communicate to our partners is the message of non-violence . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is having to tread lightly moroccan foreign minister taieb fassi fihri interpreted that statement as an expression of support for his government 's position vis-a-vis the sahrawi national liberation movement polisario and its algerian backers .
“ you have heard the german foreign minister , who said appeals to violence , such as those unfortunately issued by polisario and algeria , will not lead to a solution , ” fihri said .
“ we greatly value the statement that negotiations are the most important thing . ”
but it is unclear whether dialogue will be sufficient to resolve a conflict that has existed for decades .
fence sitting bildunterschrift : morocco and algeria both have interests in the region the western sahara was part of spain 's african colonies from the late nineteenth-century until 1975 , when the spanish withdrew , and both morocco and mauritania tried to annex the territory .
that drew resistance from polisario , the nationalist movement for the sahrawi , an arab-berber ethnic group of over 250,000 people , who claim to be the original inhabitants of the region .
by 1979 a campaign of violent resistance by polisario , with the backing of algeria , had forced mauritania from the western sahara .
morocco , however , expanded its control , and in 1991 , a un peace-keeping mission succeeded in establishing a ceasefire .
the un has recognized sadr as a representative of western saharans , and a referendum was planned to let them decide between independence or remaining part of morocco with increased autonomy .
that referendum has been stalled , though , for the past two decades .
bildunterschrift : the future of the sahrawi is up in the air morocco voted for germany to be given a two-year seat on the united nations security council .
now rabat would like a political favor in return .
“ we consulted with germany before we presented our autonomy plan , a plan of compromise that fulfills the criteria of the un security council , ” fihri said .
but polisario and algeria would like to see an independent western saharan state , and westerwelle was careful not to throw clear support in one direction or the other .
“ we are not taking sides in this question , ” westerwelle said .
“ we 're a conversation partner , and above all , we place our faith in the mediating role of the united nations . ”
indeed , in morocco , westerwelle is more interested in talking economics than politics .
here comes the sun morocco is one of the few countries in the arab world that does n't produce oil , and rabat is investing heavily in solar energy .
that represents a convergence of influence with germany , which has enormous technical expertise in that area .
bildunterschrift : solar energy is becoming more important in the middle east so westerwelle 's visit is also an opportunity to drum up some business in a country that has traditionally been oriented more toward spain and france .
“ we germans have top technology , and i 'm thinking especially of solar-energy technology , ” westerwelle said .
“ and in cooperation with morocco , we can use this solar technology particularly well .
that also represents a major chance for german companies to do business . ”
underscoring the tight connection between economics , energy and politics is the fact that the head of morocco 's one power utility , ali fassi fihri , is the moroccan foreign minister 's brother .
morocco is currently engaged in a massive solar-energy project that will cost $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euros -rrb- and hopefully provide 38 percent of the country 's energy needs by the year 2020 .
on its own , germany has invested 43 million euros in solar energy in morocco , and the european union has pumped many millions more into the project .
as westerwelle is experiencing first-hand , involvement in moroccan politics is tricky business .
but the rewards are potentially very great .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 french senate passes new e-book law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed law would affect books sold for the kindle , ipad the bill , which is expected to pass the national assembly later this month , would let publishers set e-book prices .
the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

in today ’ s segment he explains how fast a shopping mall can be turned into a prayer room . i 'm now wearing official hajj attire !
and i 'm curious to get reactions about how i look in my new outfit .
so please check out my pictures .
i ’ m pretty sure it will get a smile out of some of my friends and readers .
but that 's okay , because in my opinion , islam should also be about humor and the joy of life . here in mecca , i experience humor and the joy of life every day – even in the middle of huge crowds of people .
during a bus trip with pilgrims from austria , italy , brazil , and china all of us had some time to joke around in english which is our common language here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying pilgrims it reminds me of my time as a student in damascus , where i and other international students lived with an arabic-catholic family .
of course , here all of us are muslims and the atmosphere is quite spiritual .
the other pilgrims are praying to god , they 're praying in the bus even when it turns a sharp corner .
but every once in a while during the ride we just shoot the breeze . today is the feast of sacrifice – the day when muslims commemorate prophet ibrahim -lrb- abraham -rrb- , who 's also worshiped by christians and jews .
according to islamic tradition , he was willing to sacrifice his son to god .
but god refused his offering and a lamb was sacrificed instead .
the story lead to a religious ritual : every believing muslim who can afford it is supposed to sacrifice an animal on the feast of sacrifice and then give its meat to the hungry and the poor .
in mecca , as you can imagine , this is taking place on a large scale . prayers in the shopping mall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali almakhlafi at the kaaba but let me tell you about another intriguing sight i came across at the al-haram mosque .
right next to it , you can now find what is said to be the largest clock in the world .
it 's more than 600 meters high .
it 's absolutely breathtaking – i really have never seen anything like it in my entire life ! equally astonishing to me was the fact there ’ s starbucks coffee shop just next to the kaaba .
also close by are a number of shopping malls and if the mosque is full , pilgrims simply venture over to shopping malls to pray . in one of those malls , i met layali and farid – a couple from vienna .
for layali it ’ s her second hajj and she 's really excited about it .
in the middle of all the glittering shops and stores of the mall she tells me : " material things have no relevance here .
you really feel close to god and you understand how small you really are in relation to it all . "
after telling me that , she does n't want to give any more interviews close to the kaaba : " i want to focus on god exclusively . " i understand that , of course .
instead , i turn to farid who says he has found his spiritual home at mecca , but adds that " i 'm a real austrian – austria is my homeland . "
moments later , layali and farid vanish in the crowd . sleepless in mecca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at namira mosque in arafat make no mistake , a pilgrimage is not a cakewalk .
last night i have been up and awake the whole night . the day before , pilgrims prayed at the mountain of forgiveness and then travelled to mina in order to collect stones for the symbolic stoning of the devil . all of that made me think about a question posted by dw user thomas pudelko , who said that he had heard that the technical infrastructure in mecca has been built with german support and asked whether this had a negative impact on the spiritual atmosphere . no , i really do n't think it does .
the spiritual atmosphere is very intense and very impressive .
and many people i meet say that the security has really gotten a lot better with the help of german engineers . in muzdalifah , the only stage of the hajj where pilgrims spend their night outside , i dearly missed “ good old german " organizational skills : it took us a three hours to get only a couple of kilometers ahead .
and when we arrived , there was complete and utter chaos with hundreds of thousands of people running around aimlessly all over the place .
even worse , an old man got hit by a bus .
i only hope he survived ! answering the dw users " how do you find your way through the crowd ? " asked dw english user sandhya moirangthem .
that 's a good question , sandhya .
i was n't really sure myself before i got here , but i learned pretty quickly .
most of the time the old rule applies : just follow the crowd . on the facebook page of dw arabic , yuir boston asked me to describe the life and daily routine in mecca apart from the hajj .
dear yuri , besides the area of the kaaba mosque , a lot of the places and hajj-sites are abandoned and empty for most of the year – there 's simply no one there , only the desert .
i will describe the daily routine in saudi arabia in more detail after my return . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is supposedly the world 's largest clock how do saudi authorities make sure there are only muslims attending the hajj is a question posted by dw user " derks145 " .
well , you need a special hajj-visa in order to get here in the first place .
in most cases , you can tell the muslim background by the names , too .
whenever there are any doubts , saudi authorities also ask for proof in the form of certificates issued , for example , by a muslim community . and here 's one more question posted by user judith puppe from germany : " how much is the hajj for muslims ? "
well , i asked around and suppose it 's about 3000 euros .
but i 'm not sure about that really . after not sleeping any last night , i will now attend the feast of sacrifice and the symbolic stoning of the devil .
what ’ s more , pilgrims will also have their hair cut .
so there are lots more interesting experiences to come in my next diary entries .
for today i ’ ll end with this : happy feast of sacrifice to all my readers – muslims or non-muslims ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.11.2010 christian democrats vote in favor of embryo screening ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu voted to oppose the pre-screening of an embryo in order to check for diseases chancellor merkel 's cdu party has voted to ban pre-implantation genetic diagnosis , which could detect serious illnesses in embryos .
the party also wants to introduce stricter rules for foreigners who refuse to integrate . at its annual party conference , german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on tuesday voted to ban the screening of embryos used in ivf treatment .
a tight majority of 51 percent of the delegates voted to retain existing policy on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
policy from 2007 allows in vitro fertilization but makes it illegal to check the cells for hereditary diseases .
chancellor merkel had been pushing the ban in the run-up to the convention in karlsruhe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was among those who favor a ban " i favor a pgd ban because i am concerned that we can not define its limits properly , " merkel said on monday .
the issue is of key importance to the party as the cdu has , by definition , to uphold christian values .
according to mainstream christian teaching , life begins at conception .
deep divisions the party is however deeply divided over the issue , and the conference experienced an emotional debate lasting more than three hours .
for many , the memory of the nazis administering lethal injections to handicapped children forbids embryo screening in modern germany .
" if life is a gift from god , it is not given with any condition , " julia kloeckner , leader of cdu in the state of rhineland palatinate said .
" it would be disturbing for doctors to decide which embryos should be allowed to live by saying ' you 're okay , you 're not , " ' she added .
a lesser evil compared to still births and abortions but to delegates in favor of restricted pgd use , pre-screening would be the lesser evil compared to still births and abortions .
" there is a difference between an embryo before and after -lsb- implantation in the womb -rsb- has taken place , " said minister for family affairs kristina schroeder .
other cdu delegates agree .
according to peter hintze , deputy economics minister , it does not make sense that numerous examinations of the fetus inside the womb are allowed , but examinations of the embryo in a petri dish are not .
" pgd would not mean the creation of a designer baby , ” hintze , a protestant theologian , said .
" whoever believes the desire for a blue-eyed baby would lead anyone to undergo ivf , does not meet reality at all . "
jens spahn , cdu 's expert on health matters , did not believe that pre-screening techniques will be limited to serious diseases only .
legislation expected in july , the federal court of justice ruled that pgd is currently exempt from punishment .
in the coming weeks , the german parliament , the bundestag , will decide whether pgd should be banned by law .
tuesday ’ s decision might dissuade some cdu delegates from voting against the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded a debate on pgd justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the cdu 's coalition partner the fdp , criticized the decision and said a debate was needed in order to define strict guidelines for the use of pgd .
many of her party colleagues demand a limited usage of the technique .
other european nations such as britain , france , belgium and denmark already permit the screening .
integration policy the cdu also decided on stricter rules for foreigners who are not willing to integrate .
chancellor merkel recently declared multiculturalism to have failed and the conference agreed to pursue an integration policy that was in the " interests of germany " and an end to the " politics of misunderstood tolerance . "
" those rules are actually quite simple .
whoever wants to live here has to learn german .
whoever lives here has to respect our laws and values , " merkel said .
" those who do not follow the rules can expect to face sanctions . "

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen says ireland will be just fine for another year under pressure ewald nowotny , a member of the european central bank 's governing council , said the european union wanted a " quick , good solution to ireland , so that there would be no spill-over " to other heavily indebted countries such as portugal and spain .
ireland has come under pressure from eurozone leaders , who fear the country 's debt crisis could bring down the rest of the bloc .
debt is widespread in the eurozone and the eu , but ireland is currently seen as the weakest link .
portugal also in trouble meanwhile , portugal , which is already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , admitted on monday it was in difficulty , but portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said there were no plans as of yet for lisbon to request emergency funding .
at their monthly meeting in brussels , the eurozone finance ministers are also expected to discuss the future eurozone crisis resolution mechanism , which germany wants to start from 2013 , replacing the 440-billion-euro european financial stability facility set up after greece sought help in may .
the ministers are also expected to praise ireland 's 2011 budget cuts , which face a parliamentary vote of approval next month .
meanwhile , in ireland , finance minister brian lenihan is expected to release details of a new four-year debt-cutting program before the end of the month .

the delay could severely threaten the fledgling european diplomatic service , which is due to begin work on january 1 . the european union has failed to agree on a budget for 2011 , missing a self-imposed deadline of midnight on monday .
the deadlock centered on disagreements between the european parliament and representatives of the 27 member states ' national governments .
the breakdown came despite an existing consensus on the actual budget numbers .
last week , the european parliament bowed to pressure from national governments by agreeing to increase next year 's budget by only 2.9 percent , less than half of the increase that it had asked for .
but member states balked at parliament 's call for more power in shaping of budget over the next decade .
european parliament president jerzy buzek called the failure to agree on a new budget " bad news . "
new projects threaten funding difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be forced to operate next year using 2010 figures buzek indicated that " some member states " were to blame for the breakdown - particularly the united kingdom , sweden and the netherlands .
eu diplomats , however , said the parliament had made demands that had nothing to do with the new budget . the delay severely threatens planned institutions , including the european external action service -lrb- ead -rrb- , a new diplomatic service due to begin work at the start of next year , and the iter experimental nuclear reactor in southern france " this is an unfortunate failure , " said the chairman of the budget committee , alain lamassoure .
" but there are still a few weeks until the end of the year . "
the lawmakers are due to continue their talks on the 2011 budget and the future financing of the eu at next month 's summit , scheduled for december 16-17 . if a deal still can not be reached , the eu will be forced to operate using the 2010 budget on a monthly basis . the eu 's budget commissioner , janusz lewandowski , warned the warring sides not to gloss over the implications failing to reach consensus " i do n't want to be overdramatic ... but do not underestimate all the problems , " lewandowski said , adding that burden for subsidies due to be paid in january would fall to the member states . author : sarah harman -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 french senate passes new e-book law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed law would affect books sold for the kindle , ipad the bill , which is expected to pass the national assembly later this month , would let publishers set e-book prices .
the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

the party also wants to introduce stricter rules for foreigners who refuse to integrate . at its annual party conference , german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on tuesday voted to ban the screening of embryos used in ivf treatment .
a tight majority of 51 percent of the delegates voted to retain existing policy on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
policy from 2007 allows in vitro fertilization but makes it illegal to check the cells for hereditary diseases .
chancellor merkel had been pushing the ban in the run-up to the convention in karlsruhe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was among those who favor a ban " i favor a pgd ban because i am concerned that we can not define its limits properly , " merkel said on monday .
the issue is of key importance to the party as the cdu has , by definition , to uphold christian values .
according to mainstream christian teaching , life begins at conception .
deep divisions the party is however deeply divided over the issue , and the conference experienced an emotional debate lasting more than three hours .
for many , the memory of the nazis administering lethal injections to handicapped children forbids embryo screening in modern germany .
" if life is a gift from god , it is not given with any condition , " julia kloeckner , leader of cdu in the state of rhineland palatinate said .
" it would be disturbing for doctors to decide which embryos should be allowed to live by saying ' you 're okay , you 're not , " ' she added .
a lesser evil compared to still births and abortions but to delegates in favor of restricted pgd use , pre-screening would be the lesser evil compared to still births and abortions .
" there is a difference between an embryo before and after -lsb- implantation in the womb -rsb- has taken place , " said minister for family affairs kristina schroeder .
other cdu delegates agree .
according to peter hintze , deputy economics minister , it does not make sense that numerous examinations of the fetus inside the womb are allowed , but examinations of the embryo in a petri dish are not .
" pgd would not mean the creation of a designer baby , ” hintze , a protestant theologian , said .
" whoever believes the desire for a blue-eyed baby would lead anyone to undergo ivf , does not meet reality at all . "
jens spahn , cdu 's expert on health matters , did not believe that pre-screening techniques will be limited to serious diseases only .
legislation expected in july , the federal court of justice ruled that pgd is currently exempt from punishment .
in the coming weeks , the german parliament , the bundestag , will decide whether pgd should be banned by law .
tuesday ’ s decision might dissuade some cdu delegates from voting against the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded a debate on pgd justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the cdu 's coalition partner the fdp , criticized the decision and said a debate was needed in order to define strict guidelines for the use of pgd .
many of her party colleagues demand a limited usage of the technique .
other european nations such as britain , france , belgium and denmark already permit the screening .
integration policy the cdu also decided on stricter rules for foreigners who are not willing to integrate .
chancellor merkel recently declared multiculturalism to have failed and the conference agreed to pursue an integration policy that was in the " interests of germany " and an end to the " politics of misunderstood tolerance . "
" those rules are actually quite simple .
whoever wants to live here has to learn german .
whoever lives here has to respect our laws and values , " merkel said .
" those who do not follow the rules can expect to face sanctions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 german pen association honors chinese dissident liu xiaobo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : award-winning chinese writer liu xiaobo is currently in prison for political reasons incarcerated in china for his subversive political activities , writer and nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo has received a special award from the german pen committee in honor of his achievements . in honor of the writers in prison day on november 15 , the german branch of international writers ' association pen highlighted the plight of persecuted writers around the world , including the nearly 900 journalists and writers who at present are detained in around 100 countries .
one of these writers is chinese nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo , currently incarcerated in china as a political prisoner . chosen as the winner of this year 's hermann kesten medal - a prize awarded annually by pen for outstanding efforts in support of persecuted authors - liu was eagerly awaited by a group of guests at the ceremony in the german city of darmstadt last week , but neither he nor his wife could attend , said the president of the german branch of pen , johano strasser . behind bars at this time , liu is serving time at a jail 450 kilometers north of beijing .
on december 25 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 11 years ' imprisonment on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power . liu was one of the creators of charter 08 - a manifesto initially signed in 2008 by over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in china .
the document currently has around 10,000 signatures and demands rights such as freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and the right to form political parties . tilman spengler , one of the ceremony 's hosts , pointed out that these demands are in full accordance with the chinese constitution , which , at least in theory , guarantees human rights . bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is passionate about advancing democracy and human rights in china theory and reality in china , those who , like liu , actively support human rights , are carefully scrutinized by the authorities .
since the nobel committee announced him as the winner of the peace prize in october , pressure on those who do n't follow the government line in china has increased .
numerous dissidents , including liu 's wife , are under house arrest , have faced interrogations or have been preemptively detained . the chinese government has been doing all it can to keep its citizens away from the nobel peace prize ceremony , which is due to be held on december 10 in oslo .
just recently , china 's authorities prevented liu 's lawyer mo shaoping from leaving the country on allegations of endangering national security .
according to geir lundestad , director of the norwegian nobel institute , it is likely that neither the diploma nor the medal can be awarded , since neither liu nor anyone associated with him will be allowed to attend . ' for the victims ' chinese author and president of the chinese pen center , tianchi martin-liao , accepted the hermann kesten prize on behalf of liu .
she was a logical choice for this role , as the two of them are friends and liu himself is a former president of pen in china . in her emotional acceptance speech , martin-liao described liu 's reaction to the news from the nobel committee .
according to her , the first sentence that the tearful liu uttered was , " this prize is for the victims of the 4th of june 1989 . " for liu , the chinese democratic movement and its brutal end at the tiananmen square massacre was a turning point .
he repeatedly said that he , as a survivor , felt a duty to fight for justice on behalf of those who had been killed in the incident . a mission this sense of duty led to liu 's imprisonment .
but despite the brutal measures taken against him , liu does not see himself as a victim , but rather as a person who was aware of the risks he was facing . " as soon as you have made your decision , you should have an optimistic stance towards the risk and the pressure , with self-confidence and calmness , " said liu in 2007 . in this regard , liu is a worthy recipient of the hermann kesten medal , which is endowed with 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,600 -rrb- .
hermann kesten himself was more famous for his support of other authors than for his writings - and for passionately standing up for persecuted artists in the nazi era . author : matthias von hein -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : haiti marks one-year earthquake anniversary one year on , aid organizations try to prevent total collapse in haiti soaring cholera death toll adds to desperation in haiti problematic election seeks to shore up teetering haiti causes and blame for haitian cholera outbreak are difficult to pinpoint natural disasters -pipe- 16.11.2010 haitian aid group : ' with cholera , rapid action is critical ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things have only gotten worse in haiti after the earthquake as if it was n't enough of a task rebuilding haiti after the devastating earthquake , aid workers are now battling cholera there .
deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de social media -pipe- 16.11.2010 facebook 's new messaging feature raises privacy questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social media site has more than 500 million users facebook is entering the e-mail business with a new feature , but do n't call it e-mail !
and some are wondering if the social network 's privacy policies are strong enough . at a press conference in san francisco , california on monday , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg unveiled the latest of the social networking platform ’ s innovations , facebook messages .
with this announcement , facebook , which counts more than 500 million users , is pushing into google 's turf with this e-mail-like service .
although zuckerberg would be quick to say messages is not e-mail , facebook users will have an @ facebook.com address once the system is released , so it definitely looks similar .
one of the features of messages highlighted in the press conference is its archival function , basically storing all records of messages sent between parties .
given some of facebook 's history with privacy issues , this feature could create some discomfort for less public users .
a digital shoebox facebook 's messaging system has always been integral to the platform , providing users with a slightly less public forum for discussion than publishing everything on " facebook walls , " the bulletin boards that display the activities of a user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook 's latest plans have created a media stir with messages , zuckerberg says the concept is to " flatten " the landscape of communication .
teens , he said at the press conference , prefer sms over e-mail because the latter is too slow , whereas others strictly use e-mail or instant messaging to talk to their friends and family .
so facebook intends to use messages to aggregate these three different means of communication into one conversation .
one user may send an sms , another might reply with an e-mail , but both messages appear on facebook as part of a conversation .
the result , facebook says , will be a continuous collection of conversation history between friends .
the image used in promotional material by facebook is that messages will be analogous to the boxes of letters people once used to collect and cherish , as a way to remember the course of a relationship .
but what about privacy ?
as the new system is gradually rolled out , users will be able to send and receive e-mails with their new @ facebook.com e-mail address .
at first , facebook users will only receive mail from their facebook friends , with all other mail going into an other or a junk mail folder .
but users may " promote " mail from these folders to their primary folders if they wish .
the conversation history will be stored on facebook , which could raise security concerns for some .
when asked about an option for " off the record " conversations at the press conference , zuckerberg responded that users would have the option to delete threads or messages , but that " off the record " does n't make sense .
in the past , facebook has weathered criticism for some of the wording in their terms of use , which in february 2009 , briefly seemed to state that facebook would own any content a user uploaded to the public site , in perpetuity .
facebook and zuckerberg quickly moved to douse the flames of public outcry and released a new terms of use with the section on privacy right up at the top which states , " you own all of the content and information you post on facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings . "
you ca n't win -lrb- or lose -rrb- if you do n't play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to the user to decide how much to reveal it is in facebook 's best interest to have as much sharing and openness between people as possible , because it is in the business of creating connections between people -lrb- and brands -rrb- .
but of course , phishers and scam artists see that sort of openness and the plethora of personal information as an all-you-can-eat buffet and facebook can be dangerous waters for the uninitiated in internet security .
as the social media news hub mashable pointed out , a record of saved e-mail conversations is nothing new .
most people 's e-mail clients are clogged with old conversations , but mashable thinks that having a written record of all communication in proximity to the host of potentially personal information within facebook , could make for a dangerous mixture .
but the bottom line is that facebook , or any potential scam artists trying to take advantage of the data facebook contains , can only hurt users to the extent that they have shared important information with facebook .
of course , the more information a user gives facebook , the more complete , and perhaps rewarding , a user ’ s experience can be , but similarly , the more exposed they are .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 16.11.2010 eu steps up the pressure on irish banks , opens talks with imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks in ireland could use a few more irish euro coins for the first time , the european commission has hinted at a possible economic rescue for ireland .
the eu 's economy commissioner said the bloc was in talks with the imf on tackling problems in the irish banking sector . the european union on tuesday announced it is in talks with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- about taking on growing problems in ireland 's banking sector .
eu economy commissioner olli rehn said ahead of a meeting with eurozone finance ministers in brussels that ireland 's banking crisis was " the most pressing problem " facing the monetary union . meanwhile , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who headed tuesday 's talks by the panel of financial ministers known as the eurogroup , vowed to protect the 16-nation euro currency . juncker urged that the irish government would have to decide on financial aid , with inevitable strings attached , within days .
however , he stressed that no aid could be given if ireland did not request it . " the discussions that will take place between ireland and the -lsb- european -rsb- commission and the ecb and the imf will enable us to have at our disposal all the elements and instruments we need were ireland to make a request for assistance to the eu , the imf and the europgroup , " juncker told reporters . euro ' not threatened ' solvency concerns have grown in ireland after a 45 billion euro -lrb- $ 61 billion -rrb- bailout for private banks increased its deficit in 2010 to 32 percent of gross domestic product .
however , rehn also pointed out that the crisis in ireland was limited to its banking sector , and that the government was " funded well until the middle of next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn says ireland 's banking crisis is the eurozone 's biggest problem rehn cautioned against alarmism , saying the irish debt crisis was " not a matter of survival for the euro . "
german chancellor angela merkel repeated this assurance tuesday evening , telling ard public television she did not believe the eurozone to be in danger , but that the bloc was " experiencing turmoil and situations of the kind i would n't have dreamed of a year and a half ago , " merkel added .
rumor mill irish prime minister brian cowen meanwhile sought to dispel rumors in an address to parliament tuesday that ireland had already applied for an additional bailout for its banks .
" we have not applied to any facility .
despite the fact that it was being mentioned in a lot of so-called reputable news organizations does not make it any truer , " cowen said . he said ireland was discussing with the eu about ways to normalize market conditions and was attempting to ensure that any decisions were also in the interest of stabilizing the eurozone . a financial crisis in greece that similarly threatened the euro forced it to accept a rescue package on a larger scale earlier this year , which came with many conditions from the eu and imf . waiting on ireland bildunterschrift : ireland 's banking problems are seen as a euro threat ireland 's reluctance to accept a rescue package may be to avoid similar conditions in an effort to solve its banking crisis on its own .
however , newspaper reports in the country suggested ireland was moving closer to a bailout as the eu piled on the pressure .
" to fend off being forced into a bailout for the entire state , finance minister brian lenihan is poised to agree to a bank injection to stabilize the euro and calm markets , " the irish independent reported , citing an unnamed source .
ca n't ' throw money from helicopters ' meanwhile in a visit to rome , germany 's economy minister rainer bruederle said " throwing money from helicopters " was not a solution to fixing economic problems .
the economic phrase refers to a practice where a government simply creates money until the economy gets going again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle says money should n't be ' thrown from helicopters ' bruederle said countries like ireland or greece should implement reforms to reduce deficits in order to eliminate the need for future bailouts .
" the european community as a whole has an interest in finding a way to have guarantees of a solution when there are difficulties , " he said .
meanwhile , the ecb is currently channeling about a quarter of its loans into irish banks , and ireland has put the figure required to save its financial institutions at around 50 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disarmament -pipe- 16.11.2010 white house pushes for start , but ratification remains uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the start treaty would cut us and russian nuclear arsenals with ratification of the new start treaty only likely to be more difficult when the next congress takes office in 2011 , the white house is pushing for a vote in the lame-duck senate .
but success is all but sure . on sunday , us president barack obama and his cabinet launched a coordinated public relations blitz aimed at rallying support for the ratification of the nuclear disarmament pact washington had negotiated with moscow .
following a meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev on the sidelines of the apec economic summit in seoul , obama promised to get the us-russian nuclear arms reduction deal passed before the new congress takes office next year .
" i reiterated my commitment to get the start treaty done during the lame duck session , and i 've communicated to congress that it is a top priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original treaty was signed by george bush and mikhail gorbachev in 1991 one day later , on monday , us secretary of state , hillary clinton , and defense secretary robert gates followed up with a op-ed article in the washington post , urging congress to quickly ratify the so-called new start treaty - the successor of the original start initiated by president ronald reagan , which expired at the end of last year .
under the headline " we ca n't delay this treaty , " clinton and gates made the case for congress to pass the treaty , arguing that " our national security depends on it . " high stakes the full-court press by the obama administration highlights both the importance and the stakes for ratification of new start that would limit american and russian strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 respectively , and improve the verification regime .
but analysts are skeptical as to whether the joint appeal by obama , clinton and gates will be enough to persuade republicans to vote for the new start pact .
some republican lawmakers believe the treaty weakens the us , while others feel strongly that the newly elected senate should be given a chance to vote on the pact .
still others are loathe to give obama a victory in his lame-duck session , and are looking to renegotiate the treaty entirely . ratification requires a two-third majority , or 67 votes in the us senate .
democrats can command 59 votes in the current senate ; in the next senate they will only control 53 votes .
" i think it is doubtful that this extremely important step will be taken by the united states , " said karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at harvard university .
" the atmosphere of hostility and partisanship in the united states is such that the vote that the senate foreign relations committee took - where a majority actually voted in favor of the treaty - i do not think can be repeated .
even in a lame-duck session , ” kaiser told deutsche welle .
while some senior republican foreign-policy experts , such as richard lugar , support start and want to help get it passed , others want to renegotiate the deal or think a vote should be taken by the new congress .
political football ?
the treaty is a solid , if not overly ambitious agreement , and it should be ratified since it would increase us national security , argues patricia lewis , deputy director of the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratification will only become tougher when the new senate is sworn in " if it gets turned into political football between two parties in the country and has nothing to do with the larger and wider security issues then who is to know what will happen , " lewis told deutsche welle .
she added : " i really hope that it does get ratified and as soon as possible .
because right now there are no inspections on strategic weapons .
we want to move ahead with better and more wide-ranging cuts with the russians , and doing that if this is n't ratified would be very difficult . "
in light of its experience with the comprehensive test ban treaty , which moscow ratified and the us did n't , russia said this time around that it would only ratify new start after washington had done so .
therefore , according to kaiser , " a setback would also be very bad for the long-term goal of getting rid of all nuclear weapons and non-proliferation . "
and lewis said that if the us does n't ratify the treaty , " the trust in the united states as a negotiating partner , as a partner with whom you can do business , as a partner who can give their word and keep their word ... becomes further diminished .
that would be a real pity . "
europe 's role lewis and kaiser have different opinions as to how much influence europe and the rest of the world can have on the ratification of the treaty .
" i think the entire world will disagree if the treaty does n't get ratified because this is literally what everybody has wanted , " argues kaiser , who believes europe has n't done enough to support the ratification of the deal .
" it is not enough to simply agree with the vision of a non-nuclear world .
that 's very popular in europe .
nor is it enough to just argue you have to get rid of tactical nuclear weapons , as a number of europeans countries have done , " kaiser said .
according to kaiser , europe needs to give signals to the americans " at the highest political levels , notably the senate , " that the world expects american leadership in this matter .
but for her part , lewis is n't sure how useful it is to put more international pressure on the us .
" the united states is a democracy .
and this is very much a debate within the united states democracy , " she said . " it 's a debate for the senate to have .
i think there is a limit to which other countries can have a huge impact on domestic debates . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany coach loew taps young dortmund talent for sweden friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some young players in yellow are ready to take center stage the mercurial rise of youthful dortmund in the bundesliga has not gone unnoticed .
for wednesday 's match , germany 's coach has called up a quartet of dortmunders .
some may being staying in the national squad . on the one hand , it 's a mark of how confident joachim loew is that he 's omitted regulars like mesut oezil , thomas mueller and philipp lahm for the sweden match in goeteborg mid-week .
but a bit of additional quality in the squad is never unwelcome .
in the past , loew has called up young players as a reward for good performances in the domestic league - and as a way of securing their services for germany in future .
wednesday 's squad includes two debutees from dortmund , marcel schmelzer and mario goetze .
in addition , two of their teammates , mats hummels and kevin grosskreutz , are being capped for only the second time .
not every player who gets a call-up goes on to play a meaningful role in the national squad , of course , but each of these players have reason to hope wednesday wo n't be the last time they 'll be donning a germany jersey .
so who are these young players and what are their strengths and future prospects for germany ?
mats hummels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hummels is the bundesliga 's top-rated defender a product of bayern munich 's youth academy , 21-year-old mats hummels was allowed to move to dortmund in 2009 , and some in the bavarian capital probably regret letting him go .
except for a period when he was injured , the central defender has been a permanent part of coach juergen klopp 's starting line-up .
together with neven subotic , he heads the youngest and best defense in the bundesliga .
and central defense is one area that 's up in the air at the moment for the germany squad .
veteran arne friedrich and holger badstuber are currently out with nagging injuries , and neither per mertesacker nor heiko westermann have impressed this season .
at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .
" the last email which was sent -lsb- by police -rsb- told israilov to call the emergency number if needed … seven days later he was murdered . "
a witness silenced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israilov was a witness before the european court for human rights israilov filed charges against kadyrov after fleeing the chechen republic in 2006 , claiming to have witnessed killings and tortures conducted by kadyrov and his paramilitary forces .
he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .
the case was eventually dropped after israilov and his father disappeared into hiding and could n't be reached for further questioning .

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .
" the last email which was sent -lsb- by police -rsb- told israilov to call the emergency number if needed … seven days later he was murdered . "
a witness silenced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israilov was a witness before the european court for human rights israilov filed charges against kadyrov after fleeing the chechen republic in 2006 , claiming to have witnessed killings and tortures conducted by kadyrov and his paramilitary forces .
he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .
the case was eventually dropped after israilov and his father disappeared into hiding and could n't be reached for further questioning .
israilov 's widow is reported to be living in austria with her four children .
his father , who is said to have fled europe in fear of his life , was expected to return to vienna for the court hearing under heavy security presence .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany coach loew taps young dortmund talent for sweden friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some young players in yellow are ready to take center stage the mercurial rise of youthful dortmund in the bundesliga has not gone unnoticed .
for wednesday 's match , germany 's coach has called up a quartet of dortmunders .
some may being staying in the national squad . on the one hand , it 's a mark of how confident joachim loew is that he 's omitted regulars like mesut oezil , thomas mueller and philipp lahm for the sweden match in goeteborg mid-week .
but a bit of additional quality in the squad is never unwelcome .
in the past , loew has called up young players as a reward for good performances in the domestic league - and as a way of securing their services for germany in future .
wednesday 's squad includes two debutees from dortmund , marcel schmelzer and mario goetze .
in addition , two of their teammates , mats hummels and kevin grosskreutz , are being capped for only the second time .
not every player who gets a call-up goes on to play a meaningful role in the national squad , of course , but each of these players have reason to hope wednesday wo n't be the last time they 'll be donning a germany jersey .
so who are these young players and what are their strengths and future prospects for germany ?
mats hummels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hummels is the bundesliga 's top-rated defender a product of bayern munich 's youth academy , 21-year-old mats hummels was allowed to move to dortmund in 2009 , and some in the bavarian capital probably regret letting him go .
except for a period when he was injured , the central defender has been a permanent part of coach juergen klopp 's starting line-up .
together with neven subotic , he heads the youngest and best defense in the bundesliga .
and central defense is one area that 's up in the air at the moment for the germany squad .
veteran arne friedrich and holger badstuber are currently out with nagging injuries , and neither per mertesacker nor heiko westermann have impressed this season .
at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .

for wednesday 's match , germany 's coach has called up a quartet of dortmunders .
some may being staying in the national squad . on the one hand , it 's a mark of how confident joachim loew is that he 's omitted regulars like mesut oezil , thomas mueller and philipp lahm for the sweden match in goeteborg mid-week .
but a bit of additional quality in the squad is never unwelcome .
in the past , loew has called up young players as a reward for good performances in the domestic league - and as a way of securing their services for germany in future .
wednesday 's squad includes two debutees from dortmund , marcel schmelzer and mario goetze .
in addition , two of their teammates , mats hummels and kevin grosskreutz , are being capped for only the second time .
not every player who gets a call-up goes on to play a meaningful role in the national squad , of course , but each of these players have reason to hope wednesday wo n't be the last time they 'll be donning a germany jersey .
so who are these young players and what are their strengths and future prospects for germany ?
mats hummels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hummels is the bundesliga 's top-rated defender a product of bayern munich 's youth academy , 21-year-old mats hummels was allowed to move to dortmund in 2009 , and some in the bavarian capital probably regret letting him go .
except for a period when he was injured , the central defender has been a permanent part of coach juergen klopp 's starting line-up .
together with neven subotic , he heads the youngest and best defense in the bundesliga .
and central defense is one area that 's up in the air at the moment for the germany squad .
veteran arne friedrich and holger badstuber are currently out with nagging injuries , and neither per mertesacker nor heiko westermann have impressed this season .
at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

for wednesday 's match , germany 's coach has called up a quartet of dortmunders .
some may being staying in the national squad . on the one hand , it 's a mark of how confident joachim loew is that he 's omitted regulars like mesut oezil , thomas mueller and philipp lahm for the sweden match in goeteborg mid-week .
but a bit of additional quality in the squad is never unwelcome .
in the past , loew has called up young players as a reward for good performances in the domestic league - and as a way of securing their services for germany in future .
wednesday 's squad includes two debutees from dortmund , marcel schmelzer and mario goetze .
in addition , two of their teammates , mats hummels and kevin grosskreutz , are being capped for only the second time .
not every player who gets a call-up goes on to play a meaningful role in the national squad , of course , but each of these players have reason to hope wednesday wo n't be the last time they 'll be donning a germany jersey .
so who are these young players and what are their strengths and future prospects for germany ?
mats hummels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hummels is the bundesliga 's top-rated defender a product of bayern munich 's youth academy , 21-year-old mats hummels was allowed to move to dortmund in 2009 , and some in the bavarian capital probably regret letting him go .
except for a period when he was injured , the central defender has been a permanent part of coach juergen klopp 's starting line-up .
together with neven subotic , he heads the youngest and best defense in the bundesliga .
and central defense is one area that 's up in the air at the moment for the germany squad .
veteran arne friedrich and holger badstuber are currently out with nagging injuries , and neither per mertesacker nor heiko westermann have impressed this season .
at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 german pen association honors chinese dissident liu xiaobo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : award-winning chinese writer liu xiaobo is currently in prison for political reasons incarcerated in china for his subversive political activities , writer and nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo has received a special award from the german pen committee in honor of his achievements . in honor of the writers in prison day on november 15 , the german branch of international writers ' association pen highlighted the plight of persecuted writers around the world , including the nearly 900 journalists and writers who at present are detained in around 100 countries .
one of these writers is chinese nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo , currently incarcerated in china as a political prisoner . chosen as the winner of this year 's hermann kesten medal - a prize awarded annually by pen for outstanding efforts in support of persecuted authors - liu was eagerly awaited by a group of guests at the ceremony in the german city of darmstadt last week , but neither he nor his wife could attend , said the president of the german branch of pen , johano strasser . behind bars at this time , liu is serving time at a jail 450 kilometers north of beijing .
on december 25 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 11 years ' imprisonment on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power . liu was one of the creators of charter 08 - a manifesto initially signed in 2008 by over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in china .
the document currently has around 10,000 signatures and demands rights such as freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and the right to form political parties . tilman spengler , one of the ceremony 's hosts , pointed out that these demands are in full accordance with the chinese constitution , which , at least in theory , guarantees human rights . bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is passionate about advancing democracy and human rights in china theory and reality in china , those who , like liu , actively support human rights , are carefully scrutinized by the authorities .
since the nobel committee announced him as the winner of the peace prize in october , pressure on those who do n't follow the government line in china has increased .
numerous dissidents , including liu 's wife , are under house arrest , have faced interrogations or have been preemptively detained . the chinese government has been doing all it can to keep its citizens away from the nobel peace prize ceremony , which is due to be held on december 10 in oslo .
just recently , china 's authorities prevented liu 's lawyer mo shaoping from leaving the country on allegations of endangering national security .
according to geir lundestad , director of the norwegian nobel institute , it is likely that neither the diploma nor the medal can be awarded , since neither liu nor anyone associated with him will be allowed to attend . ' for the victims ' chinese author and president of the chinese pen center , tianchi martin-liao , accepted the hermann kesten prize on behalf of liu .
she was a logical choice for this role , as the two of them are friends and liu himself is a former president of pen in china . in her emotional acceptance speech , martin-liao described liu 's reaction to the news from the nobel committee .
according to her , the first sentence that the tearful liu uttered was , " this prize is for the victims of the 4th of june 1989 . " for liu , the chinese democratic movement and its brutal end at the tiananmen square massacre was a turning point .
he repeatedly said that he , as a survivor , felt a duty to fight for justice on behalf of those who had been killed in the incident . a mission this sense of duty led to liu 's imprisonment .
but despite the brutal measures taken against him , liu does not see himself as a victim , but rather as a person who was aware of the risks he was facing . " as soon as you have made your decision , you should have an optimistic stance towards the risk and the pressure , with self-confidence and calmness , " said liu in 2007 . in this regard , liu is a worthy recipient of the hermann kesten medal , which is endowed with 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,600 -rrb- .
hermann kesten himself was more famous for his support of other authors than for his writings - and for passionately standing up for persecuted artists in the nazi era . author : matthias von hein -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 french senate passes new e-book law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed law would affect books sold for the kindle , ipad the bill , which is expected to pass the national assembly later this month , would let publishers set e-book prices .
the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

the delay could severely threaten the fledgling european diplomatic service , which is due to begin work on january 1 . the european union has failed to agree on a budget for 2011 , missing a self-imposed deadline of midnight on monday .
the deadlock centered on disagreements between the european parliament and representatives of the 27 member states ' national governments .
the breakdown came despite an existing consensus on the actual budget numbers .
last week , the european parliament bowed to pressure from national governments by agreeing to increase next year 's budget by only 2.9 percent , less than half of the increase that it had asked for .
but member states balked at parliament 's call for more power in shaping of budget over the next decade .
european parliament president jerzy buzek called the failure to agree on a new budget " bad news . "
new projects threaten funding difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be forced to operate next year using 2010 figures buzek indicated that " some member states " were to blame for the breakdown - particularly the united kingdom , sweden and the netherlands .
eu diplomats , however , said the parliament had made demands that had nothing to do with the new budget . the delay severely threatens planned institutions , including the european external action service -lrb- ead -rrb- , a new diplomatic service due to begin work at the start of next year , and the iter experimental nuclear reactor in southern france " this is an unfortunate failure , " said the chairman of the budget committee , alain lamassoure .
" but there are still a few weeks until the end of the year . "
the lawmakers are due to continue their talks on the 2011 budget and the future financing of the eu at next month 's summit , scheduled for december 16-17 . if a deal still can not be reached , the eu will be forced to operate using the 2010 budget on a monthly basis . the eu 's budget commissioner , janusz lewandowski , warned the warring sides not to gloss over the implications failing to reach consensus " i do n't want to be overdramatic ... but do not underestimate all the problems , " lewandowski said , adding that burden for subsidies due to be paid in january would fall to the member states . author : sarah harman -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen says ireland will be just fine for another year under pressure ewald nowotny , a member of the european central bank 's governing council , said the european union wanted a " quick , good solution to ireland , so that there would be no spill-over " to other heavily indebted countries such as portugal and spain .
ireland has come under pressure from eurozone leaders , who fear the country 's debt crisis could bring down the rest of the bloc .
debt is widespread in the eurozone and the eu , but ireland is currently seen as the weakest link .
portugal also in trouble meanwhile , portugal , which is already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , admitted on monday it was in difficulty , but portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said there were no plans as of yet for lisbon to request emergency funding .
at their monthly meeting in brussels , the eurozone finance ministers are also expected to discuss the future eurozone crisis resolution mechanism , which germany wants to start from 2013 , replacing the 440-billion-euro european financial stability facility set up after greece sought help in may .
the ministers are also expected to praise ireland 's 2011 budget cuts , which face a parliamentary vote of approval next month .
meanwhile , in ireland , finance minister brian lenihan is expected to release details of a new four-year debt-cutting program before the end of the month .

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany coach loew taps young dortmund talent for sweden friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some young players in yellow are ready to take center stage the mercurial rise of youthful dortmund in the bundesliga has not gone unnoticed .
for wednesday 's match , germany 's coach has called up a quartet of dortmunders .
some may being staying in the national squad . on the one hand , it 's a mark of how confident joachim loew is that he 's omitted regulars like mesut oezil , thomas mueller and philipp lahm for the sweden match in goeteborg mid-week .
but a bit of additional quality in the squad is never unwelcome .
in the past , loew has called up young players as a reward for good performances in the domestic league - and as a way of securing their services for germany in future .
wednesday 's squad includes two debutees from dortmund , marcel schmelzer and mario goetze .
in addition , two of their teammates , mats hummels and kevin grosskreutz , are being capped for only the second time .
not every player who gets a call-up goes on to play a meaningful role in the national squad , of course , but each of these players have reason to hope wednesday wo n't be the last time they 'll be donning a germany jersey .
so who are these young players and what are their strengths and future prospects for germany ?
mats hummels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hummels is the bundesliga 's top-rated defender a product of bayern munich 's youth academy , 21-year-old mats hummels was allowed to move to dortmund in 2009 , and some in the bavarian capital probably regret letting him go .
except for a period when he was injured , the central defender has been a permanent part of coach juergen klopp 's starting line-up .
together with neven subotic , he heads the youngest and best defense in the bundesliga .
and central defense is one area that 's up in the air at the moment for the germany squad .
veteran arne friedrich and holger badstuber are currently out with nagging injuries , and neither per mertesacker nor heiko westermann have impressed this season .
at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany coach loew taps young dortmund talent for sweden friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some young players in yellow are ready to take center stage the mercurial rise of youthful dortmund in the bundesliga has not gone unnoticed .
for wednesday 's match , germany 's coach has called up a quartet of dortmunders .
some may being staying in the national squad . on the one hand , it 's a mark of how confident joachim loew is that he 's omitted regulars like mesut oezil , thomas mueller and philipp lahm for the sweden match in goeteborg mid-week .
but a bit of additional quality in the squad is never unwelcome .
in the past , loew has called up young players as a reward for good performances in the domestic league - and as a way of securing their services for germany in future .
wednesday 's squad includes two debutees from dortmund , marcel schmelzer and mario goetze .
in addition , two of their teammates , mats hummels and kevin grosskreutz , are being capped for only the second time .
not every player who gets a call-up goes on to play a meaningful role in the national squad , of course , but each of these players have reason to hope wednesday wo n't be the last time they 'll be donning a germany jersey .
so who are these young players and what are their strengths and future prospects for germany ?
mats hummels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hummels is the bundesliga 's top-rated defender a product of bayern munich 's youth academy , 21-year-old mats hummels was allowed to move to dortmund in 2009 , and some in the bavarian capital probably regret letting him go .
except for a period when he was injured , the central defender has been a permanent part of coach juergen klopp 's starting line-up .
together with neven subotic , he heads the youngest and best defense in the bundesliga .
and central defense is one area that 's up in the air at the moment for the germany squad .
veteran arne friedrich and holger badstuber are currently out with nagging injuries , and neither per mertesacker nor heiko westermann have impressed this season .
at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .

loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 german pen association honors chinese dissident liu xiaobo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : award-winning chinese writer liu xiaobo is currently in prison for political reasons incarcerated in china for his subversive political activities , writer and nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo has received a special award from the german pen committee in honor of his achievements . in honor of the writers in prison day on november 15 , the german branch of international writers ' association pen highlighted the plight of persecuted writers around the world , including the nearly 900 journalists and writers who at present are detained in around 100 countries .
one of these writers is chinese nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo , currently incarcerated in china as a political prisoner . chosen as the winner of this year 's hermann kesten medal - a prize awarded annually by pen for outstanding efforts in support of persecuted authors - liu was eagerly awaited by a group of guests at the ceremony in the german city of darmstadt last week , but neither he nor his wife could attend , said the president of the german branch of pen , johano strasser . behind bars at this time , liu is serving time at a jail 450 kilometers north of beijing .
on december 25 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 11 years ' imprisonment on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power . liu was one of the creators of charter 08 - a manifesto initially signed in 2008 by over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in china .
the document currently has around 10,000 signatures and demands rights such as freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and the right to form political parties . tilman spengler , one of the ceremony 's hosts , pointed out that these demands are in full accordance with the chinese constitution , which , at least in theory , guarantees human rights . bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is passionate about advancing democracy and human rights in china theory and reality in china , those who , like liu , actively support human rights , are carefully scrutinized by the authorities .
since the nobel committee announced him as the winner of the peace prize in october , pressure on those who do n't follow the government line in china has increased .
numerous dissidents , including liu 's wife , are under house arrest , have faced interrogations or have been preemptively detained . the chinese government has been doing all it can to keep its citizens away from the nobel peace prize ceremony , which is due to be held on december 10 in oslo .
just recently , china 's authorities prevented liu 's lawyer mo shaoping from leaving the country on allegations of endangering national security .
according to geir lundestad , director of the norwegian nobel institute , it is likely that neither the diploma nor the medal can be awarded , since neither liu nor anyone associated with him will be allowed to attend . ' for the victims ' chinese author and president of the chinese pen center , tianchi martin-liao , accepted the hermann kesten prize on behalf of liu .
she was a logical choice for this role , as the two of them are friends and liu himself is a former president of pen in china . in her emotional acceptance speech , martin-liao described liu 's reaction to the news from the nobel committee .
according to her , the first sentence that the tearful liu uttered was , " this prize is for the victims of the 4th of june 1989 . " for liu , the chinese democratic movement and its brutal end at the tiananmen square massacre was a turning point .
he repeatedly said that he , as a survivor , felt a duty to fight for justice on behalf of those who had been killed in the incident . a mission this sense of duty led to liu 's imprisonment .
but despite the brutal measures taken against him , liu does not see himself as a victim , but rather as a person who was aware of the risks he was facing . " as soon as you have made your decision , you should have an optimistic stance towards the risk and the pressure , with self-confidence and calmness , " said liu in 2007 . in this regard , liu is a worthy recipient of the hermann kesten medal , which is endowed with 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,600 -rrb- .
hermann kesten himself was more famous for his support of other authors than for his writings - and for passionately standing up for persecuted artists in the nazi era . author : matthias von hein -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

eu economy commissioner olli rehn said ahead of a meeting with eurozone finance ministers in brussels that ireland 's banking crisis was " the most pressing problem " facing the monetary union . meanwhile , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who headed tuesday 's talks by the panel of financial ministers known as the eurogroup , vowed to protect the 16-nation euro currency . juncker urged that the irish government would have to decide on financial aid , with inevitable strings attached , within days .
however , he stressed that no aid could be given if ireland did not request it . " the discussions that will take place between ireland and the -lsb- european -rsb- commission and the ecb and the imf will enable us to have at our disposal all the elements and instruments we need were ireland to make a request for assistance to the eu , the imf and the europgroup , " juncker told reporters . euro ' not threatened ' solvency concerns have grown in ireland after a 45 billion euro -lrb- $ 61 billion -rrb- bailout for private banks increased its deficit in 2010 to 32 percent of gross domestic product .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany may send nuclear waste to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste disposal is a divisive issue in germany germany is seeking to export 951 spent nuclear fuel rods , currently held at a temporary storage facility in the country 's west , to russia – but critics have called the plans dangerous and irresponsible . it may not be a universally popular move , but exporting nuclear waste is permitted under german law – on the condition that the destination country disposes the waste safely .
in fact , germany has sent shipments of nuclear waste to russia several times in the past .
up until 2009 , one firm regularly exported uranium hexafluoride , or uf6 , from a fuel rod treatment facility in gronau .
uf6 is a by-product created when uranium is enriched , and in order to avoid legal difficulties associated with disposing radioactive waste , the company rebranded its by-product as a resource to be sent to russia for processing .
the deliveries were stopped in 2009 , partly as a result of fierce protests .
now , the export of german nuclear waste to russia is back on the cards , as the german government considers an application to export 951 spent fuel rods to russia for disposal .
according to critics , however , the stakes may be higher this time around .
" we 're dealing with something different , " said tobias muenchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
greater fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian processing facility , mayak , was the site of one of the largest ever nuclear explosions muenchmeyer said that unlike uf6 , which is associated with low radiation levels , " we 're dealing with the spent nuclear fuel from a research reactor in germany , which , like all nuclear waste , also contains plutonium and other fission products and therefore represents incredibly dangerous cargo . "
the fuel rods , from a former east german research reactor near dresden , were originally imported from the soviet union in 1957 and were used until 1991 .
research reactors often use highly enriched material compared to most nuclear power plants – including material that can be used to make atom bombs .
russia and the united states have agreed to take back such waste in order to limit the spread of weapons-grade material and the german state of saxony , which owns the rods , is relying on that agreement to wash its hands of the matter .
because there is no interim storage facility in saxony , the fuel rods were moved in 2005 to ahaus in the state of north rhine-westphalia and saxony has been paying rent for their storage ever since .
" our position is clear , " a spokesperson for saxony 's science ministry said recently , " as long as international conditions are satisfied , then we want to see the material put back where it belongs . "
passing the rod as far as saxony is concerned , ' where it belongs ' is in a russian nuclear facility at mayak , some 150 km south-east of ekaterinburg .
for the opposition greens , though , mayak is anything but a safe repository .
" we know that mayak is highly contaminated , " said sylvia kotting-uhl , greens spokesperson for nuclear policy .
" we also know that mayak is not operated with anything like the same philosophy of safety that is considered standard here in germany .
so to move the waste fuel rods there is incredibly negligent . "
mayak – or ' lighthouse ' – is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union , and was also home , in 1957 , to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
some experts consider mayak 's environment to be more polluted than that of chernobyl , the site of the soviet union 's worst nuclear accident .
germany 's environment ministry , which confirmed that it had received an application to export the waste after press reports first uncovered the story last week , is responsible for determining whether such an export would be legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent transport of nuclear waste to gorleben , in northern germany , sparked mass protests setting a precedent an environment ministry spokesperson said that it would " only make a decision after careful consideration of questions over the safety of the russian site mayak . "
if the experts decide that mayak is safe , little will stand between the waste and its final repository .
the environment ministry has confirmed that a delivery contract has already been drawn up between germany and russia , ready to be signed .
this has left anti-nuclear groups and the opposition concerned , and only in part because they believe the 349 kilograms of plutonium will not be stored safely if they do make their way to mayak .
some fear the export could create a precedent , and encourage nations like russia to trade nuclear waste for cash .
greenpeace 's thomas muenchmeyer says that russians have extended such offers to accept waste in the past , but that " few of those have been official so far . "
he says south korea and taiwan are also potentially interested in such trades , but these are " still – thankfully - completely taboo in europe . "
the european union 's energy chief , guenther oettinger , recently announced plans to introduce a europe-wide ban on the export of nuclear waste .
the announcement was welcomed cautiously by anti-nuclear campaigners , who are concerned that it could contain loopholes when it comes to the export of ' resources ' like uf6 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 16.11.2010 mecca journal : sleepless in mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi in his new hajj outfit after staying up all night , dw reporter ali almakhlafi is now wearing his new pilgrim 's garment .
in today ’ s segment he explains how fast a shopping mall can be turned into a prayer room . i 'm now wearing official hajj attire !
and i 'm curious to get reactions about how i look in my new outfit .
so please check out my pictures .
i ’ m pretty sure it will get a smile out of some of my friends and readers .
but that 's okay , because in my opinion , islam should also be about humor and the joy of life . here in mecca , i experience humor and the joy of life every day – even in the middle of huge crowds of people .
during a bus trip with pilgrims from austria , italy , brazil , and china all of us had some time to joke around in english which is our common language here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying pilgrims it reminds me of my time as a student in damascus , where i and other international students lived with an arabic-catholic family .
of course , here all of us are muslims and the atmosphere is quite spiritual .
the other pilgrims are praying to god , they 're praying in the bus even when it turns a sharp corner .
but every once in a while during the ride we just shoot the breeze . today is the feast of sacrifice – the day when muslims commemorate prophet ibrahim -lrb- abraham -rrb- , who 's also worshiped by christians and jews .
according to islamic tradition , he was willing to sacrifice his son to god .
but god refused his offering and a lamb was sacrificed instead .
the story lead to a religious ritual : every believing muslim who can afford it is supposed to sacrifice an animal on the feast of sacrifice and then give its meat to the hungry and the poor .
in mecca , as you can imagine , this is taking place on a large scale . prayers in the shopping mall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali almakhlafi at the kaaba but let me tell you about another intriguing sight i came across at the al-haram mosque .
right next to it , you can now find what is said to be the largest clock in the world .
it 's more than 600 meters high .
it 's absolutely breathtaking – i really have never seen anything like it in my entire life ! equally astonishing to me was the fact there ’ s starbucks coffee shop just next to the kaaba .
also close by are a number of shopping malls and if the mosque is full , pilgrims simply venture over to shopping malls to pray . in one of those malls , i met layali and farid – a couple from vienna .
for layali it ’ s her second hajj and she 's really excited about it .
in the middle of all the glittering shops and stores of the mall she tells me : " material things have no relevance here .
you really feel close to god and you understand how small you really are in relation to it all . "
after telling me that , she does n't want to give any more interviews close to the kaaba : " i want to focus on god exclusively . " i understand that , of course .
instead , i turn to farid who says he has found his spiritual home at mecca , but adds that " i 'm a real austrian – austria is my homeland . "
moments later , layali and farid vanish in the crowd . sleepless in mecca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at namira mosque in arafat make no mistake , a pilgrimage is not a cakewalk .
last night i have been up and awake the whole night . the day before , pilgrims prayed at the mountain of forgiveness and then travelled to mina in order to collect stones for the symbolic stoning of the devil . all of that made me think about a question posted by dw user thomas pudelko , who said that he had heard that the technical infrastructure in mecca has been built with german support and asked whether this had a negative impact on the spiritual atmosphere . no , i really do n't think it does .
the spiritual atmosphere is very intense and very impressive .
and many people i meet say that the security has really gotten a lot better with the help of german engineers . in muzdalifah , the only stage of the hajj where pilgrims spend their night outside , i dearly missed “ good old german " organizational skills : it took us a three hours to get only a couple of kilometers ahead .
and when we arrived , there was complete and utter chaos with hundreds of thousands of people running around aimlessly all over the place .
even worse , an old man got hit by a bus .
i only hope he survived ! answering the dw users " how do you find your way through the crowd ? " asked dw english user sandhya moirangthem .
that 's a good question , sandhya .
i was n't really sure myself before i got here , but i learned pretty quickly .
most of the time the old rule applies : just follow the crowd . on the facebook page of dw arabic , yuir boston asked me to describe the life and daily routine in mecca apart from the hajj .
dear yuri , besides the area of the kaaba mosque , a lot of the places and hajj-sites are abandoned and empty for most of the year – there 's simply no one there , only the desert .
i will describe the daily routine in saudi arabia in more detail after my return . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is supposedly the world 's largest clock how do saudi authorities make sure there are only muslims attending the hajj is a question posted by dw user " derks145 " .
well , you need a special hajj-visa in order to get here in the first place .
in most cases , you can tell the muslim background by the names , too .
whenever there are any doubts , saudi authorities also ask for proof in the form of certificates issued , for example , by a muslim community . and here 's one more question posted by user judith puppe from germany : " how much is the hajj for muslims ? "
well , i asked around and suppose it 's about 3000 euros .
but i 'm not sure about that really . after not sleeping any last night , i will now attend the feast of sacrifice and the symbolic stoning of the devil .
what ’ s more , pilgrims will also have their hair cut .
so there are lots more interesting experiences to come in my next diary entries .
for today i ’ ll end with this : happy feast of sacrifice to all my readers – muslims or non-muslims ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 french senate passes new e-book law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed law would affect books sold for the kindle , ipad the bill , which is expected to pass the national assembly later this month , would let publishers set e-book prices .
the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .

in today ’ s segment he explains how fast a shopping mall can be turned into a prayer room . i 'm now wearing official hajj attire !
and i 'm curious to get reactions about how i look in my new outfit .
so please check out my pictures .
i ’ m pretty sure it will get a smile out of some of my friends and readers .
but that 's okay , because in my opinion , islam should also be about humor and the joy of life . here in mecca , i experience humor and the joy of life every day – even in the middle of huge crowds of people .
during a bus trip with pilgrims from austria , italy , brazil , and china all of us had some time to joke around in english which is our common language here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying pilgrims it reminds me of my time as a student in damascus , where i and other international students lived with an arabic-catholic family .
of course , here all of us are muslims and the atmosphere is quite spiritual .
the other pilgrims are praying to god , they 're praying in the bus even when it turns a sharp corner .
but every once in a while during the ride we just shoot the breeze . today is the feast of sacrifice – the day when muslims commemorate prophet ibrahim -lrb- abraham -rrb- , who 's also worshiped by christians and jews .
according to islamic tradition , he was willing to sacrifice his son to god .
but god refused his offering and a lamb was sacrificed instead .
the story lead to a religious ritual : every believing muslim who can afford it is supposed to sacrifice an animal on the feast of sacrifice and then give its meat to the hungry and the poor .
in mecca , as you can imagine , this is taking place on a large scale . prayers in the shopping mall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali almakhlafi at the kaaba but let me tell you about another intriguing sight i came across at the al-haram mosque .
right next to it , you can now find what is said to be the largest clock in the world .
it 's more than 600 meters high .
it 's absolutely breathtaking – i really have never seen anything like it in my entire life ! equally astonishing to me was the fact there ’ s starbucks coffee shop just next to the kaaba .
also close by are a number of shopping malls and if the mosque is full , pilgrims simply venture over to shopping malls to pray . in one of those malls , i met layali and farid – a couple from vienna .
for layali it ’ s her second hajj and she 's really excited about it .
in the middle of all the glittering shops and stores of the mall she tells me : " material things have no relevance here .
you really feel close to god and you understand how small you really are in relation to it all . "
after telling me that , she does n't want to give any more interviews close to the kaaba : " i want to focus on god exclusively . " i understand that , of course .
instead , i turn to farid who says he has found his spiritual home at mecca , but adds that " i 'm a real austrian – austria is my homeland . "
moments later , layali and farid vanish in the crowd . sleepless in mecca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at namira mosque in arafat make no mistake , a pilgrimage is not a cakewalk .
last night i have been up and awake the whole night . the day before , pilgrims prayed at the mountain of forgiveness and then travelled to mina in order to collect stones for the symbolic stoning of the devil . all of that made me think about a question posted by dw user thomas pudelko , who said that he had heard that the technical infrastructure in mecca has been built with german support and asked whether this had a negative impact on the spiritual atmosphere . no , i really do n't think it does .
the spiritual atmosphere is very intense and very impressive .
and many people i meet say that the security has really gotten a lot better with the help of german engineers . in muzdalifah , the only stage of the hajj where pilgrims spend their night outside , i dearly missed “ good old german " organizational skills : it took us a three hours to get only a couple of kilometers ahead .
and when we arrived , there was complete and utter chaos with hundreds of thousands of people running around aimlessly all over the place .
even worse , an old man got hit by a bus .
i only hope he survived ! answering the dw users " how do you find your way through the crowd ? " asked dw english user sandhya moirangthem .
that 's a good question , sandhya .
i was n't really sure myself before i got here , but i learned pretty quickly .
most of the time the old rule applies : just follow the crowd . on the facebook page of dw arabic , yuir boston asked me to describe the life and daily routine in mecca apart from the hajj .
dear yuri , besides the area of the kaaba mosque , a lot of the places and hajj-sites are abandoned and empty for most of the year – there 's simply no one there , only the desert .
i will describe the daily routine in saudi arabia in more detail after my return . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is supposedly the world 's largest clock how do saudi authorities make sure there are only muslims attending the hajj is a question posted by dw user " derks145 " .
well , you need a special hajj-visa in order to get here in the first place .
in most cases , you can tell the muslim background by the names , too .
whenever there are any doubts , saudi authorities also ask for proof in the form of certificates issued , for example , by a muslim community . and here 's one more question posted by user judith puppe from germany : " how much is the hajj for muslims ? "
well , i asked around and suppose it 's about 3000 euros .
but i 'm not sure about that really . after not sleeping any last night , i will now attend the feast of sacrifice and the symbolic stoning of the devil .
what ’ s more , pilgrims will also have their hair cut .
so there are lots more interesting experiences to come in my next diary entries .
for today i ’ ll end with this : happy feast of sacrifice to all my readers – muslims or non-muslims ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 german pen association honors chinese dissident liu xiaobo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : award-winning chinese writer liu xiaobo is currently in prison for political reasons incarcerated in china for his subversive political activities , writer and nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo has received a special award from the german pen committee in honor of his achievements . in honor of the writers in prison day on november 15 , the german branch of international writers ' association pen highlighted the plight of persecuted writers around the world , including the nearly 900 journalists and writers who at present are detained in around 100 countries .
one of these writers is chinese nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo , currently incarcerated in china as a political prisoner . chosen as the winner of this year 's hermann kesten medal - a prize awarded annually by pen for outstanding efforts in support of persecuted authors - liu was eagerly awaited by a group of guests at the ceremony in the german city of darmstadt last week , but neither he nor his wife could attend , said the president of the german branch of pen , johano strasser . behind bars at this time , liu is serving time at a jail 450 kilometers north of beijing .
on december 25 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 11 years ' imprisonment on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power . liu was one of the creators of charter 08 - a manifesto initially signed in 2008 by over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in china .
the document currently has around 10,000 signatures and demands rights such as freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and the right to form political parties . tilman spengler , one of the ceremony 's hosts , pointed out that these demands are in full accordance with the chinese constitution , which , at least in theory , guarantees human rights . bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is passionate about advancing democracy and human rights in china theory and reality in china , those who , like liu , actively support human rights , are carefully scrutinized by the authorities .
since the nobel committee announced him as the winner of the peace prize in october , pressure on those who do n't follow the government line in china has increased .
numerous dissidents , including liu 's wife , are under house arrest , have faced interrogations or have been preemptively detained . the chinese government has been doing all it can to keep its citizens away from the nobel peace prize ceremony , which is due to be held on december 10 in oslo .
just recently , china 's authorities prevented liu 's lawyer mo shaoping from leaving the country on allegations of endangering national security .
according to geir lundestad , director of the norwegian nobel institute , it is likely that neither the diploma nor the medal can be awarded , since neither liu nor anyone associated with him will be allowed to attend . ' for the victims ' chinese author and president of the chinese pen center , tianchi martin-liao , accepted the hermann kesten prize on behalf of liu .
she was a logical choice for this role , as the two of them are friends and liu himself is a former president of pen in china . in her emotional acceptance speech , martin-liao described liu 's reaction to the news from the nobel committee .
according to her , the first sentence that the tearful liu uttered was , " this prize is for the victims of the 4th of june 1989 . " for liu , the chinese democratic movement and its brutal end at the tiananmen square massacre was a turning point .
he repeatedly said that he , as a survivor , felt a duty to fight for justice on behalf of those who had been killed in the incident . a mission this sense of duty led to liu 's imprisonment .
but despite the brutal measures taken against him , liu does not see himself as a victim , but rather as a person who was aware of the risks he was facing . " as soon as you have made your decision , you should have an optimistic stance towards the risk and the pressure , with self-confidence and calmness , " said liu in 2007 . in this regard , liu is a worthy recipient of the hermann kesten medal , which is endowed with 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,600 -rrb- .
hermann kesten himself was more famous for his support of other authors than for his writings - and for passionately standing up for persecuted artists in the nazi era . author : matthias von hein -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 16.11.2010 deutsche bank 's ackermann is ' european banker of the year ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has been head of deutsche bank since 2006 josef ackermann is a polarizing figure .
he 's been called everything from ' visionary ' to germany 's ' most-hated manager ' .
now he 's been named ' european banker of the year . '
but the prestigious title has a troubled past . deutsche bank 's ceo josef ackermann has been one of the most looked-to figures of the german banking world throughout the financial crisis .
public perception of him fluctuates : he has been seen as a slick leader capable of leveraging money to get anything he wants , a punching bag to be held responsible for the consequences capitalism , and simply a profit-oriented manager with little social conscience .
but on monday , at the start of the euro finance week in frankfurt , ackermann found himself in the unaccustomed role of a media darling .
he was named " european banker of the year " by a panel of economic journalists who praised his leadership of deutsche bank during troubled times .
" with this prize we want to set a counterpoint to the public perception of josef ackermann in germany , " said hermann-josef knipper , deputy editor-in-chief of the business newspaper handelsblatt .
a persona such as ackermann 's could well be necessary to thrive in the world of international finance .
born in switzerland , ackermann became the first non-german chief executive officer of deutsche bank in 2006 .
since then he has cut loose industry holdings and some 20,000 employees .
a focus on private customers has been replaced with a concentration on larger and more lucrative clients .
in short , ackermann has made himself anything but popular in doing his job .
however , his circle of friends extends to the highest levels of german government .
in 2008 , his invitation from chancellor angela merkel to a dinner at the chancellery in berlin set off a flurry of media speculation about cronyism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquartered in frankfurt , deutsche bank maintains an international presence award has mixed history the european banker of the year title was first awarded in 1994 .
previous winners include high-profile policy-makers , such as jean-claude trichet of the european central bank and jean-claude juncker , the prime minister of luxembourg .
winners from the private sector , however , have been associated with scandal and misfortune .
peter wuffli of ubs won the award in 2005 , but two years later he was embarrassingly ousted from his position as ceo for taking excessive risks .
the royal bank of scotland 's fred goodwin – known as " fred the shred " for his aggressive job cutting strategy – won the award in 2003 , but stepped down from his position in 2008 after leading his bank into crisis .
udo steffens , president of the frankfurt school of finance , says ackermann deserves his award and is unlikely to suffer a similar fall from grace .
" ackermann , together with his management team , steered deutsche bank through the crisis relatively unscathed , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that is a very excellent feat of management . "
deutsche bank maintains an international presence like no other german bank , according to steffens .
" it 's vital for an industrialized nation like germany to have such a bank , " he said .
" despite all of the criticism , germans should be proud to have such a bank in their country . "

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .
" the last email which was sent -lsb- by police -rsb- told israilov to call the emergency number if needed … seven days later he was murdered . "
a witness silenced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israilov was a witness before the european court for human rights israilov filed charges against kadyrov after fleeing the chechen republic in 2006 , claiming to have witnessed killings and tortures conducted by kadyrov and his paramilitary forces .
he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .
the case was eventually dropped after israilov and his father disappeared into hiding and could n't be reached for further questioning .
israilov 's widow is reported to be living in austria with her four children .
his father , who is said to have fled europe in fear of his life , was expected to return to vienna for the court hearing under heavy security presence .

in today ’ s segment he explains how fast a shopping mall can be turned into a prayer room . i 'm now wearing official hajj attire !
and i 'm curious to get reactions about how i look in my new outfit .
so please check out my pictures .
i ’ m pretty sure it will get a smile out of some of my friends and readers .
but that 's okay , because in my opinion , islam should also be about humor and the joy of life . here in mecca , i experience humor and the joy of life every day – even in the middle of huge crowds of people .
during a bus trip with pilgrims from austria , italy , brazil , and china all of us had some time to joke around in english which is our common language here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying pilgrims it reminds me of my time as a student in damascus , where i and other international students lived with an arabic-catholic family .
of course , here all of us are muslims and the atmosphere is quite spiritual .
the other pilgrims are praying to god , they 're praying in the bus even when it turns a sharp corner .
but every once in a while during the ride we just shoot the breeze . today is the feast of sacrifice – the day when muslims commemorate prophet ibrahim -lrb- abraham -rrb- , who 's also worshiped by christians and jews .
according to islamic tradition , he was willing to sacrifice his son to god .
but god refused his offering and a lamb was sacrificed instead .
the story lead to a religious ritual : every believing muslim who can afford it is supposed to sacrifice an animal on the feast of sacrifice and then give its meat to the hungry and the poor .
in mecca , as you can imagine , this is taking place on a large scale . prayers in the shopping mall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali almakhlafi at the kaaba but let me tell you about another intriguing sight i came across at the al-haram mosque .
right next to it , you can now find what is said to be the largest clock in the world .
it 's more than 600 meters high .
it 's absolutely breathtaking – i really have never seen anything like it in my entire life ! equally astonishing to me was the fact there ’ s starbucks coffee shop just next to the kaaba .
also close by are a number of shopping malls and if the mosque is full , pilgrims simply venture over to shopping malls to pray . in one of those malls , i met layali and farid – a couple from vienna .
for layali it ’ s her second hajj and she 's really excited about it .
in the middle of all the glittering shops and stores of the mall she tells me : " material things have no relevance here .
you really feel close to god and you understand how small you really are in relation to it all . "
after telling me that , she does n't want to give any more interviews close to the kaaba : " i want to focus on god exclusively . " i understand that , of course .
instead , i turn to farid who says he has found his spiritual home at mecca , but adds that " i 'm a real austrian – austria is my homeland . "
moments later , layali and farid vanish in the crowd . sleepless in mecca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at namira mosque in arafat make no mistake , a pilgrimage is not a cakewalk .
last night i have been up and awake the whole night . the day before , pilgrims prayed at the mountain of forgiveness and then travelled to mina in order to collect stones for the symbolic stoning of the devil . all of that made me think about a question posted by dw user thomas pudelko , who said that he had heard that the technical infrastructure in mecca has been built with german support and asked whether this had a negative impact on the spiritual atmosphere . no , i really do n't think it does .
the spiritual atmosphere is very intense and very impressive .
and many people i meet say that the security has really gotten a lot better with the help of german engineers . in muzdalifah , the only stage of the hajj where pilgrims spend their night outside , i dearly missed “ good old german " organizational skills : it took us a three hours to get only a couple of kilometers ahead .
and when we arrived , there was complete and utter chaos with hundreds of thousands of people running around aimlessly all over the place .
even worse , an old man got hit by a bus .
i only hope he survived ! answering the dw users " how do you find your way through the crowd ? " asked dw english user sandhya moirangthem .
that 's a good question , sandhya .
i was n't really sure myself before i got here , but i learned pretty quickly .
most of the time the old rule applies : just follow the crowd . on the facebook page of dw arabic , yuir boston asked me to describe the life and daily routine in mecca apart from the hajj .
dear yuri , besides the area of the kaaba mosque , a lot of the places and hajj-sites are abandoned and empty for most of the year – there 's simply no one there , only the desert .
i will describe the daily routine in saudi arabia in more detail after my return . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is supposedly the world 's largest clock how do saudi authorities make sure there are only muslims attending the hajj is a question posted by dw user " derks145 " .
well , you need a special hajj-visa in order to get here in the first place .
in most cases , you can tell the muslim background by the names , too .
whenever there are any doubts , saudi authorities also ask for proof in the form of certificates issued , for example , by a muslim community . and here 's one more question posted by user judith puppe from germany : " how much is the hajj for muslims ? "
well , i asked around and suppose it 's about 3000 euros .
but i 'm not sure about that really . after not sleeping any last night , i will now attend the feast of sacrifice and the symbolic stoning of the devil .
what ’ s more , pilgrims will also have their hair cut .
so there are lots more interesting experiences to come in my next diary entries .
for today i ’ ll end with this : happy feast of sacrifice to all my readers – muslims or non-muslims ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de social media -pipe- 16.11.2010 facebook 's new messaging feature raises privacy questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social media site has more than 500 million users facebook is entering the e-mail business with a new feature , but do n't call it e-mail !
and some are wondering if the social network 's privacy policies are strong enough . at a press conference in san francisco , california on monday , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg unveiled the latest of the social networking platform ’ s innovations , facebook messages .
with this announcement , facebook , which counts more than 500 million users , is pushing into google 's turf with this e-mail-like service .
although zuckerberg would be quick to say messages is not e-mail , facebook users will have an @ facebook.com address once the system is released , so it definitely looks similar .
one of the features of messages highlighted in the press conference is its archival function , basically storing all records of messages sent between parties .
given some of facebook 's history with privacy issues , this feature could create some discomfort for less public users .
a digital shoebox facebook 's messaging system has always been integral to the platform , providing users with a slightly less public forum for discussion than publishing everything on " facebook walls , " the bulletin boards that display the activities of a user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook 's latest plans have created a media stir with messages , zuckerberg says the concept is to " flatten " the landscape of communication .
teens , he said at the press conference , prefer sms over e-mail because the latter is too slow , whereas others strictly use e-mail or instant messaging to talk to their friends and family .
so facebook intends to use messages to aggregate these three different means of communication into one conversation .
one user may send an sms , another might reply with an e-mail , but both messages appear on facebook as part of a conversation .
the result , facebook says , will be a continuous collection of conversation history between friends .
the image used in promotional material by facebook is that messages will be analogous to the boxes of letters people once used to collect and cherish , as a way to remember the course of a relationship .
but what about privacy ?
as the new system is gradually rolled out , users will be able to send and receive e-mails with their new @ facebook.com e-mail address .
at first , facebook users will only receive mail from their facebook friends , with all other mail going into an other or a junk mail folder .
but users may " promote " mail from these folders to their primary folders if they wish .
the conversation history will be stored on facebook , which could raise security concerns for some .
when asked about an option for " off the record " conversations at the press conference , zuckerberg responded that users would have the option to delete threads or messages , but that " off the record " does n't make sense .
in the past , facebook has weathered criticism for some of the wording in their terms of use , which in february 2009 , briefly seemed to state that facebook would own any content a user uploaded to the public site , in perpetuity .
facebook and zuckerberg quickly moved to douse the flames of public outcry and released a new terms of use with the section on privacy right up at the top which states , " you own all of the content and information you post on facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings . "
you ca n't win -lrb- or lose -rrb- if you do n't play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to the user to decide how much to reveal it is in facebook 's best interest to have as much sharing and openness between people as possible , because it is in the business of creating connections between people -lrb- and brands -rrb- .
but of course , phishers and scam artists see that sort of openness and the plethora of personal information as an all-you-can-eat buffet and facebook can be dangerous waters for the uninitiated in internet security .
as the social media news hub mashable pointed out , a record of saved e-mail conversations is nothing new .
most people 's e-mail clients are clogged with old conversations , but mashable thinks that having a written record of all communication in proximity to the host of potentially personal information within facebook , could make for a dangerous mixture .
but the bottom line is that facebook , or any potential scam artists trying to take advantage of the data facebook contains , can only hurt users to the extent that they have shared important information with facebook .
of course , the more information a user gives facebook , the more complete , and perhaps rewarding , a user ’ s experience can be , but similarly , the more exposed they are .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

the party also wants to introduce stricter rules for foreigners who refuse to integrate . at its annual party conference , german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on tuesday voted to ban the screening of embryos used in ivf treatment .
a tight majority of 51 percent of the delegates voted to retain existing policy on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
policy from 2007 allows in vitro fertilization but makes it illegal to check the cells for hereditary diseases .
chancellor merkel had been pushing the ban in the run-up to the convention in karlsruhe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was among those who favor a ban " i favor a pgd ban because i am concerned that we can not define its limits properly , " merkel said on monday .
the issue is of key importance to the party as the cdu has , by definition , to uphold christian values .
according to mainstream christian teaching , life begins at conception .
deep divisions the party is however deeply divided over the issue , and the conference experienced an emotional debate lasting more than three hours .
for many , the memory of the nazis administering lethal injections to handicapped children forbids embryo screening in modern germany .
" if life is a gift from god , it is not given with any condition , " julia kloeckner , leader of cdu in the state of rhineland palatinate said .
" it would be disturbing for doctors to decide which embryos should be allowed to live by saying ' you 're okay , you 're not , " ' she added .
a lesser evil compared to still births and abortions but to delegates in favor of restricted pgd use , pre-screening would be the lesser evil compared to still births and abortions .
" there is a difference between an embryo before and after -lsb- implantation in the womb -rsb- has taken place , " said minister for family affairs kristina schroeder .
other cdu delegates agree .
according to peter hintze , deputy economics minister , it does not make sense that numerous examinations of the fetus inside the womb are allowed , but examinations of the embryo in a petri dish are not .
" pgd would not mean the creation of a designer baby , ” hintze , a protestant theologian , said .
" whoever believes the desire for a blue-eyed baby would lead anyone to undergo ivf , does not meet reality at all . "
jens spahn , cdu 's expert on health matters , did not believe that pre-screening techniques will be limited to serious diseases only .
legislation expected in july , the federal court of justice ruled that pgd is currently exempt from punishment .
in the coming weeks , the german parliament , the bundestag , will decide whether pgd should be banned by law .
tuesday ’ s decision might dissuade some cdu delegates from voting against the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded a debate on pgd justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the cdu 's coalition partner the fdp , criticized the decision and said a debate was needed in order to define strict guidelines for the use of pgd .
many of her party colleagues demand a limited usage of the technique .
other european nations such as britain , france , belgium and denmark already permit the screening .
integration policy the cdu also decided on stricter rules for foreigners who are not willing to integrate .
chancellor merkel recently declared multiculturalism to have failed and the conference agreed to pursue an integration policy that was in the " interests of germany " and an end to the " politics of misunderstood tolerance . "
" those rules are actually quite simple .
whoever wants to live here has to learn german .
whoever lives here has to respect our laws and values , " merkel said .
" those who do not follow the rules can expect to face sanctions . "

the delay could severely threaten the fledgling european diplomatic service , which is due to begin work on january 1 . the european union has failed to agree on a budget for 2011 , missing a self-imposed deadline of midnight on monday .
the deadlock centered on disagreements between the european parliament and representatives of the 27 member states ' national governments .
the breakdown came despite an existing consensus on the actual budget numbers .
last week , the european parliament bowed to pressure from national governments by agreeing to increase next year 's budget by only 2.9 percent , less than half of the increase that it had asked for .
but member states balked at parliament 's call for more power in shaping of budget over the next decade .
european parliament president jerzy buzek called the failure to agree on a new budget " bad news . "
new projects threaten funding difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be forced to operate next year using 2010 figures buzek indicated that " some member states " were to blame for the breakdown - particularly the united kingdom , sweden and the netherlands .

" but there are still a few weeks until the end of the year . "
the lawmakers are due to continue their talks on the 2011 budget and the future financing of the eu at next month 's summit , scheduled for december 16-17 . if a deal still can not be reached , the eu will be forced to operate using the 2010 budget on a monthly basis . the eu 's budget commissioner , janusz lewandowski , warned the warring sides not to gloss over the implications failing to reach consensus " i do n't want to be overdramatic ... but do not underestimate all the problems , " lewandowski said , adding that burden for subsidies due to be paid in january would fall to the member states . author : sarah harman -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen says ireland will be just fine for another year under pressure ewald nowotny , a member of the european central bank 's governing council , said the european union wanted a " quick , good solution to ireland , so that there would be no spill-over " to other heavily indebted countries such as portugal and spain .
ireland has come under pressure from eurozone leaders , who fear the country 's debt crisis could bring down the rest of the bloc .
debt is widespread in the eurozone and the eu , but ireland is currently seen as the weakest link .
portugal also in trouble meanwhile , portugal , which is already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , admitted on monday it was in difficulty , but portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said there were no plans as of yet for lisbon to request emergency funding .
at their monthly meeting in brussels , the eurozone finance ministers are also expected to discuss the future eurozone crisis resolution mechanism , which germany wants to start from 2013 , replacing the 440-billion-euro european financial stability facility set up after greece sought help in may .
the ministers are also expected to praise ireland 's 2011 budget cuts , which face a parliamentary vote of approval next month .
meanwhile , in ireland , finance minister brian lenihan is expected to release details of a new four-year debt-cutting program before the end of the month .

the eu 's economy commissioner said the bloc was in talks with the imf on tackling problems in the irish banking sector . the european union on tuesday announced it is in talks with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- about taking on growing problems in ireland 's banking sector .
eu economy commissioner olli rehn said ahead of a meeting with eurozone finance ministers in brussels that ireland 's banking crisis was " the most pressing problem " facing the monetary union . meanwhile , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who headed tuesday 's talks by the panel of financial ministers known as the eurogroup , vowed to protect the 16-nation euro currency . juncker urged that the irish government would have to decide on financial aid , with inevitable strings attached , within days .
however , he stressed that no aid could be given if ireland did not request it . " the discussions that will take place between ireland and the -lsb- european -rsb- commission and the ecb and the imf will enable us to have at our disposal all the elements and instruments we need were ireland to make a request for assistance to the eu , the imf and the europgroup , " juncker told reporters . euro ' not threatened ' solvency concerns have grown in ireland after a 45 billion euro -lrb- $ 61 billion -rrb- bailout for private banks increased its deficit in 2010 to 32 percent of gross domestic product .
however , rehn also pointed out that the crisis in ireland was limited to its banking sector , and that the government was " funded well until the middle of next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn says ireland 's banking crisis is the eurozone 's biggest problem rehn cautioned against alarmism , saying the irish debt crisis was " not a matter of survival for the euro . "
german chancellor angela merkel repeated this assurance tuesday evening , telling ard public television she did not believe the eurozone to be in danger , but that the bloc was " experiencing turmoil and situations of the kind i would n't have dreamed of a year and a half ago , " merkel added .
rumor mill irish prime minister brian cowen meanwhile sought to dispel rumors in an address to parliament tuesday that ireland had already applied for an additional bailout for its banks .
" we have not applied to any facility .
despite the fact that it was being mentioned in a lot of so-called reputable news organizations does not make it any truer , " cowen said . he said ireland was discussing with the eu about ways to normalize market conditions and was attempting to ensure that any decisions were also in the interest of stabilizing the eurozone . a financial crisis in greece that similarly threatened the euro forced it to accept a rescue package on a larger scale earlier this year , which came with many conditions from the eu and imf . waiting on ireland bildunterschrift : ireland 's banking problems are seen as a euro threat ireland 's reluctance to accept a rescue package may be to avoid similar conditions in an effort to solve its banking crisis on its own .
however , newspaper reports in the country suggested ireland was moving closer to a bailout as the eu piled on the pressure .
" to fend off being forced into a bailout for the entire state , finance minister brian lenihan is poised to agree to a bank injection to stabilize the euro and calm markets , " the irish independent reported , citing an unnamed source .
ca n't ' throw money from helicopters ' meanwhile in a visit to rome , germany 's economy minister rainer bruederle said " throwing money from helicopters " was not a solution to fixing economic problems .
the economic phrase refers to a practice where a government simply creates money until the economy gets going again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle says money should n't be ' thrown from helicopters ' bruederle said countries like ireland or greece should implement reforms to reduce deficits in order to eliminate the need for future bailouts .
" the european community as a whole has an interest in finding a way to have guarantees of a solution when there are difficulties , " he said .
meanwhile , the ecb is currently channeling about a quarter of its loans into irish banks , and ireland has put the figure required to save its financial institutions at around 50 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de social media -pipe- 16.11.2010 facebook 's new messaging feature raises privacy questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social media site has more than 500 million users facebook is entering the e-mail business with a new feature , but do n't call it e-mail !
and some are wondering if the social network 's privacy policies are strong enough . at a press conference in san francisco , california on monday , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg unveiled the latest of the social networking platform ’ s innovations , facebook messages .
with this announcement , facebook , which counts more than 500 million users , is pushing into google 's turf with this e-mail-like service .
although zuckerberg would be quick to say messages is not e-mail , facebook users will have an @ facebook.com address once the system is released , so it definitely looks similar .
one of the features of messages highlighted in the press conference is its archival function , basically storing all records of messages sent between parties .
given some of facebook 's history with privacy issues , this feature could create some discomfort for less public users .
a digital shoebox facebook 's messaging system has always been integral to the platform , providing users with a slightly less public forum for discussion than publishing everything on " facebook walls , " the bulletin boards that display the activities of a user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook 's latest plans have created a media stir with messages , zuckerberg says the concept is to " flatten " the landscape of communication .
teens , he said at the press conference , prefer sms over e-mail because the latter is too slow , whereas others strictly use e-mail or instant messaging to talk to their friends and family .
so facebook intends to use messages to aggregate these three different means of communication into one conversation .
one user may send an sms , another might reply with an e-mail , but both messages appear on facebook as part of a conversation .
the result , facebook says , will be a continuous collection of conversation history between friends .
the image used in promotional material by facebook is that messages will be analogous to the boxes of letters people once used to collect and cherish , as a way to remember the course of a relationship .
but what about privacy ?
as the new system is gradually rolled out , users will be able to send and receive e-mails with their new @ facebook.com e-mail address .
at first , facebook users will only receive mail from their facebook friends , with all other mail going into an other or a junk mail folder .
but users may " promote " mail from these folders to their primary folders if they wish .
the conversation history will be stored on facebook , which could raise security concerns for some .
when asked about an option for " off the record " conversations at the press conference , zuckerberg responded that users would have the option to delete threads or messages , but that " off the record " does n't make sense .
in the past , facebook has weathered criticism for some of the wording in their terms of use , which in february 2009 , briefly seemed to state that facebook would own any content a user uploaded to the public site , in perpetuity .
facebook and zuckerberg quickly moved to douse the flames of public outcry and released a new terms of use with the section on privacy right up at the top which states , " you own all of the content and information you post on facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings . "
you ca n't win -lrb- or lose -rrb- if you do n't play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to the user to decide how much to reveal it is in facebook 's best interest to have as much sharing and openness between people as possible , because it is in the business of creating connections between people -lrb- and brands -rrb- .
but of course , phishers and scam artists see that sort of openness and the plethora of personal information as an all-you-can-eat buffet and facebook can be dangerous waters for the uninitiated in internet security .
as the social media news hub mashable pointed out , a record of saved e-mail conversations is nothing new .
most people 's e-mail clients are clogged with old conversations , but mashable thinks that having a written record of all communication in proximity to the host of potentially personal information within facebook , could make for a dangerous mixture .
but the bottom line is that facebook , or any potential scam artists trying to take advantage of the data facebook contains , can only hurt users to the extent that they have shared important information with facebook .
of course , the more information a user gives facebook , the more complete , and perhaps rewarding , a user ’ s experience can be , but similarly , the more exposed they are .

and some are wondering if the social network 's privacy policies are strong enough . at a press conference in san francisco , california on monday , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg unveiled the latest of the social networking platform ’ s innovations , facebook messages .
with this announcement , facebook , which counts more than 500 million users , is pushing into google 's turf with this e-mail-like service .
although zuckerberg would be quick to say messages is not e-mail , facebook users will have an @ facebook.com address once the system is released , so it definitely looks similar .
one of the features of messages highlighted in the press conference is its archival function , basically storing all records of messages sent between parties .
given some of facebook 's history with privacy issues , this feature could create some discomfort for less public users .
a digital shoebox facebook 's messaging system has always been integral to the platform , providing users with a slightly less public forum for discussion than publishing everything on " facebook walls , " the bulletin boards that display the activities of a user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook 's latest plans have created a media stir with messages , zuckerberg says the concept is to " flatten " the landscape of communication .
teens , he said at the press conference , prefer sms over e-mail because the latter is too slow , whereas others strictly use e-mail or instant messaging to talk to their friends and family .
so facebook intends to use messages to aggregate these three different means of communication into one conversation .
one user may send an sms , another might reply with an e-mail , but both messages appear on facebook as part of a conversation .
the result , facebook says , will be a continuous collection of conversation history between friends .
the image used in promotional material by facebook is that messages will be analogous to the boxes of letters people once used to collect and cherish , as a way to remember the course of a relationship .
but what about privacy ?
as the new system is gradually rolled out , users will be able to send and receive e-mails with their new @ facebook.com e-mail address .
at first , facebook users will only receive mail from their facebook friends , with all other mail going into an other or a junk mail folder .
but users may " promote " mail from these folders to their primary folders if they wish .
the conversation history will be stored on facebook , which could raise security concerns for some .
when asked about an option for " off the record " conversations at the press conference , zuckerberg responded that users would have the option to delete threads or messages , but that " off the record " does n't make sense .
in the past , facebook has weathered criticism for some of the wording in their terms of use , which in february 2009 , briefly seemed to state that facebook would own any content a user uploaded to the public site , in perpetuity .
facebook and zuckerberg quickly moved to douse the flames of public outcry and released a new terms of use with the section on privacy right up at the top which states , " you own all of the content and information you post on facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings . "
you ca n't win -lrb- or lose -rrb- if you do n't play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to the user to decide how much to reveal it is in facebook 's best interest to have as much sharing and openness between people as possible , because it is in the business of creating connections between people -lrb- and brands -rrb- .
but of course , phishers and scam artists see that sort of openness and the plethora of personal information as an all-you-can-eat buffet and facebook can be dangerous waters for the uninitiated in internet security .
as the social media news hub mashable pointed out , a record of saved e-mail conversations is nothing new .
most people 's e-mail clients are clogged with old conversations , but mashable thinks that having a written record of all communication in proximity to the host of potentially personal information within facebook , could make for a dangerous mixture .
but the bottom line is that facebook , or any potential scam artists trying to take advantage of the data facebook contains , can only hurt users to the extent that they have shared important information with facebook .
of course , the more information a user gives facebook , the more complete , and perhaps rewarding , a user ’ s experience can be , but similarly , the more exposed they are .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen says ireland will be just fine for another year under pressure ewald nowotny , a member of the european central bank 's governing council , said the european union wanted a " quick , good solution to ireland , so that there would be no spill-over " to other heavily indebted countries such as portugal and spain .
ireland has come under pressure from eurozone leaders , who fear the country 's debt crisis could bring down the rest of the bloc .
debt is widespread in the eurozone and the eu , but ireland is currently seen as the weakest link .
portugal also in trouble meanwhile , portugal , which is already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , admitted on monday it was in difficulty , but portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said there were no plans as of yet for lisbon to request emergency funding .
at their monthly meeting in brussels , the eurozone finance ministers are also expected to discuss the future eurozone crisis resolution mechanism , which germany wants to start from 2013 , replacing the 440-billion-euro european financial stability facility set up after greece sought help in may .
the ministers are also expected to praise ireland 's 2011 budget cuts , which face a parliamentary vote of approval next month .
meanwhile , in ireland , finance minister brian lenihan is expected to release details of a new four-year debt-cutting program before the end of the month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disarmament -pipe- 16.11.2010 white house pushes for start , but ratification remains uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the start treaty would cut us and russian nuclear arsenals with ratification of the new start treaty only likely to be more difficult when the next congress takes office in 2011 , the white house is pushing for a vote in the lame-duck senate .
but success is all but sure . on sunday , us president barack obama and his cabinet launched a coordinated public relations blitz aimed at rallying support for the ratification of the nuclear disarmament pact washington had negotiated with moscow .
following a meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev on the sidelines of the apec economic summit in seoul , obama promised to get the us-russian nuclear arms reduction deal passed before the new congress takes office next year .
" i reiterated my commitment to get the start treaty done during the lame duck session , and i 've communicated to congress that it is a top priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original treaty was signed by george bush and mikhail gorbachev in 1991 one day later , on monday , us secretary of state , hillary clinton , and defense secretary robert gates followed up with a op-ed article in the washington post , urging congress to quickly ratify the so-called new start treaty - the successor of the original start initiated by president ronald reagan , which expired at the end of last year .
under the headline " we ca n't delay this treaty , " clinton and gates made the case for congress to pass the treaty , arguing that " our national security depends on it . " high stakes the full-court press by the obama administration highlights both the importance and the stakes for ratification of new start that would limit american and russian strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 respectively , and improve the verification regime .
but analysts are skeptical as to whether the joint appeal by obama , clinton and gates will be enough to persuade republicans to vote for the new start pact .
some republican lawmakers believe the treaty weakens the us , while others feel strongly that the newly elected senate should be given a chance to vote on the pact .
still others are loathe to give obama a victory in his lame-duck session , and are looking to renegotiate the treaty entirely . ratification requires a two-third majority , or 67 votes in the us senate .
democrats can command 59 votes in the current senate ; in the next senate they will only control 53 votes .
" i think it is doubtful that this extremely important step will be taken by the united states , " said karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at harvard university .
" the atmosphere of hostility and partisanship in the united states is such that the vote that the senate foreign relations committee took - where a majority actually voted in favor of the treaty - i do not think can be repeated .
even in a lame-duck session , ” kaiser told deutsche welle .
while some senior republican foreign-policy experts , such as richard lugar , support start and want to help get it passed , others want to renegotiate the deal or think a vote should be taken by the new congress .
political football ?
the treaty is a solid , if not overly ambitious agreement , and it should be ratified since it would increase us national security , argues patricia lewis , deputy director of the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratification will only become tougher when the new senate is sworn in " if it gets turned into political football between two parties in the country and has nothing to do with the larger and wider security issues then who is to know what will happen , " lewis told deutsche welle .
she added : " i really hope that it does get ratified and as soon as possible .
because right now there are no inspections on strategic weapons .
we want to move ahead with better and more wide-ranging cuts with the russians , and doing that if this is n't ratified would be very difficult . "
in light of its experience with the comprehensive test ban treaty , which moscow ratified and the us did n't , russia said this time around that it would only ratify new start after washington had done so .
therefore , according to kaiser , " a setback would also be very bad for the long-term goal of getting rid of all nuclear weapons and non-proliferation . "
and lewis said that if the us does n't ratify the treaty , " the trust in the united states as a negotiating partner , as a partner with whom you can do business , as a partner who can give their word and keep their word ... becomes further diminished .
that would be a real pity . "
europe 's role lewis and kaiser have different opinions as to how much influence europe and the rest of the world can have on the ratification of the treaty .
" i think the entire world will disagree if the treaty does n't get ratified because this is literally what everybody has wanted , " argues kaiser , who believes europe has n't done enough to support the ratification of the deal .
" it is not enough to simply agree with the vision of a non-nuclear world .
that 's very popular in europe .
nor is it enough to just argue you have to get rid of tactical nuclear weapons , as a number of europeans countries have done , " kaiser said .
according to kaiser , europe needs to give signals to the americans " at the highest political levels , notably the senate , " that the world expects american leadership in this matter .
but for her part , lewis is n't sure how useful it is to put more international pressure on the us .
" the united states is a democracy .
and this is very much a debate within the united states democracy , " she said . " it 's a debate for the senate to have .
i think there is a limit to which other countries can have a huge impact on domestic debates . "

the party also wants to introduce stricter rules for foreigners who refuse to integrate . at its annual party conference , german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on tuesday voted to ban the screening of embryos used in ivf treatment .
a tight majority of 51 percent of the delegates voted to retain existing policy on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
policy from 2007 allows in vitro fertilization but makes it illegal to check the cells for hereditary diseases .
chancellor merkel had been pushing the ban in the run-up to the convention in karlsruhe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was among those who favor a ban " i favor a pgd ban because i am concerned that we can not define its limits properly , " merkel said on monday .
the issue is of key importance to the party as the cdu has , by definition , to uphold christian values .
according to mainstream christian teaching , life begins at conception .
deep divisions the party is however deeply divided over the issue , and the conference experienced an emotional debate lasting more than three hours .
for many , the memory of the nazis administering lethal injections to handicapped children forbids embryo screening in modern germany .
" if life is a gift from god , it is not given with any condition , " julia kloeckner , leader of cdu in the state of rhineland palatinate said .
" it would be disturbing for doctors to decide which embryos should be allowed to live by saying ' you 're okay , you 're not , " ' she added .
a lesser evil compared to still births and abortions but to delegates in favor of restricted pgd use , pre-screening would be the lesser evil compared to still births and abortions .
" there is a difference between an embryo before and after -lsb- implantation in the womb -rsb- has taken place , " said minister for family affairs kristina schroeder .
other cdu delegates agree .
according to peter hintze , deputy economics minister , it does not make sense that numerous examinations of the fetus inside the womb are allowed , but examinations of the embryo in a petri dish are not .
" pgd would not mean the creation of a designer baby , ” hintze , a protestant theologian , said .
" whoever believes the desire for a blue-eyed baby would lead anyone to undergo ivf , does not meet reality at all . "
jens spahn , cdu 's expert on health matters , did not believe that pre-screening techniques will be limited to serious diseases only .
legislation expected in july , the federal court of justice ruled that pgd is currently exempt from punishment .
in the coming weeks , the german parliament , the bundestag , will decide whether pgd should be banned by law .
tuesday ’ s decision might dissuade some cdu delegates from voting against the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded a debate on pgd justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the cdu 's coalition partner the fdp , criticized the decision and said a debate was needed in order to define strict guidelines for the use of pgd .
many of her party colleagues demand a limited usage of the technique .
other european nations such as britain , france , belgium and denmark already permit the screening .
integration policy the cdu also decided on stricter rules for foreigners who are not willing to integrate .
chancellor merkel recently declared multiculturalism to have failed and the conference agreed to pursue an integration policy that was in the " interests of germany " and an end to the " politics of misunderstood tolerance . "
" those rules are actually quite simple .
whoever wants to live here has to learn german .
whoever lives here has to respect our laws and values , " merkel said .
" those who do not follow the rules can expect to face sanctions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 16.11.2010 eu steps up the pressure on irish banks , opens talks with imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks in ireland could use a few more irish euro coins for the first time , the european commission has hinted at a possible economic rescue for ireland .
the eu 's economy commissioner said the bloc was in talks with the imf on tackling problems in the irish banking sector . the european union on tuesday announced it is in talks with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- about taking on growing problems in ireland 's banking sector .
eu economy commissioner olli rehn said ahead of a meeting with eurozone finance ministers in brussels that ireland 's banking crisis was " the most pressing problem " facing the monetary union . meanwhile , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who headed tuesday 's talks by the panel of financial ministers known as the eurogroup , vowed to protect the 16-nation euro currency . juncker urged that the irish government would have to decide on financial aid , with inevitable strings attached , within days .
however , he stressed that no aid could be given if ireland did not request it . " the discussions that will take place between ireland and the -lsb- european -rsb- commission and the ecb and the imf will enable us to have at our disposal all the elements and instruments we need were ireland to make a request for assistance to the eu , the imf and the europgroup , " juncker told reporters . euro ' not threatened ' solvency concerns have grown in ireland after a 45 billion euro -lrb- $ 61 billion -rrb- bailout for private banks increased its deficit in 2010 to 32 percent of gross domestic product .
however , rehn also pointed out that the crisis in ireland was limited to its banking sector , and that the government was " funded well until the middle of next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn says ireland 's banking crisis is the eurozone 's biggest problem rehn cautioned against alarmism , saying the irish debt crisis was " not a matter of survival for the euro . "
german chancellor angela merkel repeated this assurance tuesday evening , telling ard public television she did not believe the eurozone to be in danger , but that the bloc was " experiencing turmoil and situations of the kind i would n't have dreamed of a year and a half ago , " merkel added .
rumor mill irish prime minister brian cowen meanwhile sought to dispel rumors in an address to parliament tuesday that ireland had already applied for an additional bailout for its banks .
" we have not applied to any facility .
despite the fact that it was being mentioned in a lot of so-called reputable news organizations does not make it any truer , " cowen said . he said ireland was discussing with the eu about ways to normalize market conditions and was attempting to ensure that any decisions were also in the interest of stabilizing the eurozone . a financial crisis in greece that similarly threatened the euro forced it to accept a rescue package on a larger scale earlier this year , which came with many conditions from the eu and imf . waiting on ireland bildunterschrift : ireland 's banking problems are seen as a euro threat ireland 's reluctance to accept a rescue package may be to avoid similar conditions in an effort to solve its banking crisis on its own .
however , newspaper reports in the country suggested ireland was moving closer to a bailout as the eu piled on the pressure .
" to fend off being forced into a bailout for the entire state , finance minister brian lenihan is poised to agree to a bank injection to stabilize the euro and calm markets , " the irish independent reported , citing an unnamed source .
ca n't ' throw money from helicopters ' meanwhile in a visit to rome , germany 's economy minister rainer bruederle said " throwing money from helicopters " was not a solution to fixing economic problems .
the economic phrase refers to a practice where a government simply creates money until the economy gets going again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle says money should n't be ' thrown from helicopters ' bruederle said countries like ireland or greece should implement reforms to reduce deficits in order to eliminate the need for future bailouts .
" the european community as a whole has an interest in finding a way to have guarantees of a solution when there are difficulties , " he said .
meanwhile , the ecb is currently channeling about a quarter of its loans into irish banks , and ireland has put the figure required to save its financial institutions at around 50 billion euros .

eu economy commissioner olli rehn said ahead of a meeting with eurozone finance ministers in brussels that ireland 's banking crisis was " the most pressing problem " facing the monetary union . meanwhile , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who headed tuesday 's talks by the panel of financial ministers known as the eurogroup , vowed to protect the 16-nation euro currency . juncker urged that the irish government would have to decide on financial aid , with inevitable strings attached , within days .
however , he stressed that no aid could be given if ireland did not request it . " the discussions that will take place between ireland and the -lsb- european -rsb- commission and the ecb and the imf will enable us to have at our disposal all the elements and instruments we need were ireland to make a request for assistance to the eu , the imf and the europgroup , " juncker told reporters . euro ' not threatened ' solvency concerns have grown in ireland after a 45 billion euro -lrb- $ 61 billion -rrb- bailout for private banks increased its deficit in 2010 to 32 percent of gross domestic product .

" the european community as a whole has an interest in finding a way to have guarantees of a solution when there are difficulties , " he said .
meanwhile , the ecb is currently channeling about a quarter of its loans into irish banks , and ireland has put the figure required to save its financial institutions at around 50 billion euros .

and some are wondering if the social network 's privacy policies are strong enough . at a press conference in san francisco , california on monday , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg unveiled the latest of the social networking platform ’ s innovations , facebook messages .
with this announcement , facebook , which counts more than 500 million users , is pushing into google 's turf with this e-mail-like service .
although zuckerberg would be quick to say messages is not e-mail , facebook users will have an @ facebook.com address once the system is released , so it definitely looks similar .
one of the features of messages highlighted in the press conference is its archival function , basically storing all records of messages sent between parties .
given some of facebook 's history with privacy issues , this feature could create some discomfort for less public users .
a digital shoebox facebook 's messaging system has always been integral to the platform , providing users with a slightly less public forum for discussion than publishing everything on " facebook walls , " the bulletin boards that display the activities of a user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook 's latest plans have created a media stir with messages , zuckerberg says the concept is to " flatten " the landscape of communication .
teens , he said at the press conference , prefer sms over e-mail because the latter is too slow , whereas others strictly use e-mail or instant messaging to talk to their friends and family .
so facebook intends to use messages to aggregate these three different means of communication into one conversation .
one user may send an sms , another might reply with an e-mail , but both messages appear on facebook as part of a conversation .
the result , facebook says , will be a continuous collection of conversation history between friends .
the image used in promotional material by facebook is that messages will be analogous to the boxes of letters people once used to collect and cherish , as a way to remember the course of a relationship .
but what about privacy ?
as the new system is gradually rolled out , users will be able to send and receive e-mails with their new @ facebook.com e-mail address .
at first , facebook users will only receive mail from their facebook friends , with all other mail going into an other or a junk mail folder .
but users may " promote " mail from these folders to their primary folders if they wish .
the conversation history will be stored on facebook , which could raise security concerns for some .
when asked about an option for " off the record " conversations at the press conference , zuckerberg responded that users would have the option to delete threads or messages , but that " off the record " does n't make sense .
in the past , facebook has weathered criticism for some of the wording in their terms of use , which in february 2009 , briefly seemed to state that facebook would own any content a user uploaded to the public site , in perpetuity .
facebook and zuckerberg quickly moved to douse the flames of public outcry and released a new terms of use with the section on privacy right up at the top which states , " you own all of the content and information you post on facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings . "

but of course , phishers and scam artists see that sort of openness and the plethora of personal information as an all-you-can-eat buffet and facebook can be dangerous waters for the uninitiated in internet security .

most people 's e-mail clients are clogged with old conversations , but mashable thinks that having a written record of all communication in proximity to the host of potentially personal information within facebook , could make for a dangerous mixture .
but the bottom line is that facebook , or any potential scam artists trying to take advantage of the data facebook contains , can only hurt users to the extent that they have shared important information with facebook .
of course , the more information a user gives facebook , the more complete , and perhaps rewarding , a user ’ s experience can be , but similarly , the more exposed they are .

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

a short time later her father was shot down on the street .
that was 10 years ago .
today , although the perpetrators are known , they have never been arrested .
and this is no exception in colombia .
what is exception , though , is that the media have reported on this case .
because reporting on crimes like this puts journalists and witnesses at considerable risk .
the journalist , yesenia bayona , took this risk .
and with her video report on yamile ’ s story , she won the “ caminos de la paz ” -lrb- “ paths toward freedom ” -rrb- competition , held by dw-akademie and the colombian universidad del norte .
with tears in her eyes , the local journalist from yopal – in the conflict-ravaged region of casanare - accepted the award from the german development minister , dirk niebel .

he wants to talk about energy , but his hosts have put a different issue on the agenda . the western sahara is an important region for a variety of reasons .
the prevalence of sun makes it an ideal location for solar energy facilities , and the area is rich in phosphate .
the disputed territory is also the subject of a tug-of-war between morocco and the algerian backed sahrawi arab democratic republic -lrb- sadr -rrb- , which wants it to become an independent state .
when german foreign minister guido westerwelle arrived in the moroccan capital on monday for the first day of a three-day visit , he was confronted with the issue .
he chose his words with care .
“ the main thing is that everyone involved places their faith in negotiations and dialogue , ” westerwelle said .
“ what we want to communicate to our partners is the message of non-violence . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is having to tread lightly moroccan foreign minister taieb fassi fihri interpreted that statement as an expression of support for his government 's position vis-a-vis the sahrawi national liberation movement polisario and its algerian backers .
“ you have heard the german foreign minister , who said appeals to violence , such as those unfortunately issued by polisario and algeria , will not lead to a solution , ” fihri said .
“ we greatly value the statement that negotiations are the most important thing . ”
but it is unclear whether dialogue will be sufficient to resolve a conflict that has existed for decades .
fence sitting bildunterschrift : morocco and algeria both have interests in the region the western sahara was part of spain 's african colonies from the late nineteenth-century until 1975 , when the spanish withdrew , and both morocco and mauritania tried to annex the territory .
that drew resistance from polisario , the nationalist movement for the sahrawi , an arab-berber ethnic group of over 250,000 people , who claim to be the original inhabitants of the region .
by 1979 a campaign of violent resistance by polisario , with the backing of algeria , had forced mauritania from the western sahara .
morocco , however , expanded its control , and in 1991 , a un peace-keeping mission succeeded in establishing a ceasefire .
the un has recognized sadr as a representative of western saharans , and a referendum was planned to let them decide between independence or remaining part of morocco with increased autonomy .
that referendum has been stalled , though , for the past two decades .
bildunterschrift : the future of the sahrawi is up in the air morocco voted for germany to be given a two-year seat on the united nations security council .
now rabat would like a political favor in return .
“ we consulted with germany before we presented our autonomy plan , a plan of compromise that fulfills the criteria of the un security council , ” fihri said .
but polisario and algeria would like to see an independent western saharan state , and westerwelle was careful not to throw clear support in one direction or the other .
“ we are not taking sides in this question , ” westerwelle said .
“ we 're a conversation partner , and above all , we place our faith in the mediating role of the united nations . ”
indeed , in morocco , westerwelle is more interested in talking economics than politics .
here comes the sun morocco is one of the few countries in the arab world that does n't produce oil , and rabat is investing heavily in solar energy .
that represents a convergence of influence with germany , which has enormous technical expertise in that area .
bildunterschrift : solar energy is becoming more important in the middle east so westerwelle 's visit is also an opportunity to drum up some business in a country that has traditionally been oriented more toward spain and france .
“ we germans have top technology , and i 'm thinking especially of solar-energy technology , ” westerwelle said .
“ and in cooperation with morocco , we can use this solar technology particularly well .
that also represents a major chance for german companies to do business . ”
underscoring the tight connection between economics , energy and politics is the fact that the head of morocco 's one power utility , ali fassi fihri , is the moroccan foreign minister 's brother .
morocco is currently engaged in a massive solar-energy project that will cost $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euros -rrb- and hopefully provide 38 percent of the country 's energy needs by the year 2020 .
on its own , germany has invested 43 million euros in solar energy in morocco , and the european union has pumped many millions more into the project .
as westerwelle is experiencing first-hand , involvement in moroccan politics is tricky business .
but the rewards are potentially very great .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 16.11.2010 deutsche bank 's ackermann is ' european banker of the year ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has been head of deutsche bank since 2006 josef ackermann is a polarizing figure .
he 's been called everything from ' visionary ' to germany 's ' most-hated manager ' .
now he 's been named ' european banker of the year . '
but the prestigious title has a troubled past . deutsche bank 's ceo josef ackermann has been one of the most looked-to figures of the german banking world throughout the financial crisis .
public perception of him fluctuates : he has been seen as a slick leader capable of leveraging money to get anything he wants , a punching bag to be held responsible for the consequences capitalism , and simply a profit-oriented manager with little social conscience .
but on monday , at the start of the euro finance week in frankfurt , ackermann found himself in the unaccustomed role of a media darling .
he was named " european banker of the year " by a panel of economic journalists who praised his leadership of deutsche bank during troubled times .
" with this prize we want to set a counterpoint to the public perception of josef ackermann in germany , " said hermann-josef knipper , deputy editor-in-chief of the business newspaper handelsblatt .
a persona such as ackermann 's could well be necessary to thrive in the world of international finance .
born in switzerland , ackermann became the first non-german chief executive officer of deutsche bank in 2006 .
since then he has cut loose industry holdings and some 20,000 employees .
a focus on private customers has been replaced with a concentration on larger and more lucrative clients .
in short , ackermann has made himself anything but popular in doing his job .
however , his circle of friends extends to the highest levels of german government .
in 2008 , his invitation from chancellor angela merkel to a dinner at the chancellery in berlin set off a flurry of media speculation about cronyism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquartered in frankfurt , deutsche bank maintains an international presence award has mixed history the european banker of the year title was first awarded in 1994 .
previous winners include high-profile policy-makers , such as jean-claude trichet of the european central bank and jean-claude juncker , the prime minister of luxembourg .
winners from the private sector , however , have been associated with scandal and misfortune .
peter wuffli of ubs won the award in 2005 , but two years later he was embarrassingly ousted from his position as ceo for taking excessive risks .
the royal bank of scotland 's fred goodwin – known as " fred the shred " for his aggressive job cutting strategy – won the award in 2003 , but stepped down from his position in 2008 after leading his bank into crisis .
udo steffens , president of the frankfurt school of finance , says ackermann deserves his award and is unlikely to suffer a similar fall from grace .
" ackermann , together with his management team , steered deutsche bank through the crisis relatively unscathed , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that is a very excellent feat of management . "
deutsche bank maintains an international presence like no other german bank , according to steffens .
" it 's vital for an industrialized nation like germany to have such a bank , " he said .
" despite all of the criticism , germans should be proud to have such a bank in their country . "

public perception of him fluctuates : he has been seen as a slick leader capable of leveraging money to get anything he wants , a punching bag to be held responsible for the consequences capitalism , and simply a profit-oriented manager with little social conscience .
but on monday , at the start of the euro finance week in frankfurt , ackermann found himself in the unaccustomed role of a media darling .
he was named " european banker of the year " by a panel of economic journalists who praised his leadership of deutsche bank during troubled times .
" with this prize we want to set a counterpoint to the public perception of josef ackermann in germany , " said hermann-josef knipper , deputy editor-in-chief of the business newspaper handelsblatt .
a persona such as ackermann 's could well be necessary to thrive in the world of international finance .
born in switzerland , ackermann became the first non-german chief executive officer of deutsche bank in 2006 .
since then he has cut loose industry holdings and some 20,000 employees .
a focus on private customers has been replaced with a concentration on larger and more lucrative clients .
in short , ackermann has made himself anything but popular in doing his job .
however , his circle of friends extends to the highest levels of german government .
in 2008 , his invitation from chancellor angela merkel to a dinner at the chancellery in berlin set off a flurry of media speculation about cronyism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquartered in frankfurt , deutsche bank maintains an international presence award has mixed history the european banker of the year title was first awarded in 1994 .
previous winners include high-profile policy-makers , such as jean-claude trichet of the european central bank and jean-claude juncker , the prime minister of luxembourg .
winners from the private sector , however , have been associated with scandal and misfortune .
peter wuffli of ubs won the award in 2005 , but two years later he was embarrassingly ousted from his position as ceo for taking excessive risks .
the royal bank of scotland 's fred goodwin – known as " fred the shred " for his aggressive job cutting strategy – won the award in 2003 , but stepped down from his position in 2008 after leading his bank into crisis .
udo steffens , president of the frankfurt school of finance , says ackermann deserves his award and is unlikely to suffer a similar fall from grace .
" ackermann , together with his management team , steered deutsche bank through the crisis relatively unscathed , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that is a very excellent feat of management . "
deutsche bank maintains an international presence like no other german bank , according to steffens .
" it 's vital for an industrialized nation like germany to have such a bank , " he said .
" despite all of the criticism , germans should be proud to have such a bank in their country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany may send nuclear waste to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste disposal is a divisive issue in germany germany is seeking to export 951 spent nuclear fuel rods , currently held at a temporary storage facility in the country 's west , to russia – but critics have called the plans dangerous and irresponsible . it may not be a universally popular move , but exporting nuclear waste is permitted under german law – on the condition that the destination country disposes the waste safely .
in fact , germany has sent shipments of nuclear waste to russia several times in the past .
up until 2009 , one firm regularly exported uranium hexafluoride , or uf6 , from a fuel rod treatment facility in gronau .
uf6 is a by-product created when uranium is enriched , and in order to avoid legal difficulties associated with disposing radioactive waste , the company rebranded its by-product as a resource to be sent to russia for processing .
the deliveries were stopped in 2009 , partly as a result of fierce protests .
now , the export of german nuclear waste to russia is back on the cards , as the german government considers an application to export 951 spent fuel rods to russia for disposal .
according to critics , however , the stakes may be higher this time around .
" we 're dealing with something different , " said tobias muenchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
greater fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian processing facility , mayak , was the site of one of the largest ever nuclear explosions muenchmeyer said that unlike uf6 , which is associated with low radiation levels , " we 're dealing with the spent nuclear fuel from a research reactor in germany , which , like all nuclear waste , also contains plutonium and other fission products and therefore represents incredibly dangerous cargo . "
the fuel rods , from a former east german research reactor near dresden , were originally imported from the soviet union in 1957 and were used until 1991 .
research reactors often use highly enriched material compared to most nuclear power plants – including material that can be used to make atom bombs .
russia and the united states have agreed to take back such waste in order to limit the spread of weapons-grade material and the german state of saxony , which owns the rods , is relying on that agreement to wash its hands of the matter .
because there is no interim storage facility in saxony , the fuel rods were moved in 2005 to ahaus in the state of north rhine-westphalia and saxony has been paying rent for their storage ever since .
" our position is clear , " a spokesperson for saxony 's science ministry said recently , " as long as international conditions are satisfied , then we want to see the material put back where it belongs . "
passing the rod as far as saxony is concerned , ' where it belongs ' is in a russian nuclear facility at mayak , some 150 km south-east of ekaterinburg .
for the opposition greens , though , mayak is anything but a safe repository .
" we know that mayak is highly contaminated , " said sylvia kotting-uhl , greens spokesperson for nuclear policy .
" we also know that mayak is not operated with anything like the same philosophy of safety that is considered standard here in germany .
so to move the waste fuel rods there is incredibly negligent . "
mayak – or ' lighthouse ' – is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union , and was also home , in 1957 , to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
some experts consider mayak 's environment to be more polluted than that of chernobyl , the site of the soviet union 's worst nuclear accident .
germany 's environment ministry , which confirmed that it had received an application to export the waste after press reports first uncovered the story last week , is responsible for determining whether such an export would be legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent transport of nuclear waste to gorleben , in northern germany , sparked mass protests setting a precedent an environment ministry spokesperson said that it would " only make a decision after careful consideration of questions over the safety of the russian site mayak . "
if the experts decide that mayak is safe , little will stand between the waste and its final repository .
the environment ministry has confirmed that a delivery contract has already been drawn up between germany and russia , ready to be signed .
this has left anti-nuclear groups and the opposition concerned , and only in part because they believe the 349 kilograms of plutonium will not be stored safely if they do make their way to mayak .
some fear the export could create a precedent , and encourage nations like russia to trade nuclear waste for cash .
greenpeace 's thomas muenchmeyer says that russians have extended such offers to accept waste in the past , but that " few of those have been official so far . "
he says south korea and taiwan are also potentially interested in such trades , but these are " still – thankfully - completely taboo in europe . "
the european union 's energy chief , guenther oettinger , recently announced plans to introduce a europe-wide ban on the export of nuclear waste .
the announcement was welcomed cautiously by anti-nuclear campaigners , who are concerned that it could contain loopholes when it comes to the export of ' resources ' like uf6 .

in fact , germany has sent shipments of nuclear waste to russia several times in the past .
up until 2009 , one firm regularly exported uranium hexafluoride , or uf6 , from a fuel rod treatment facility in gronau .
uf6 is a by-product created when uranium is enriched , and in order to avoid legal difficulties associated with disposing radioactive waste , the company rebranded its by-product as a resource to be sent to russia for processing .
the deliveries were stopped in 2009 , partly as a result of fierce protests .
now , the export of german nuclear waste to russia is back on the cards , as the german government considers an application to export 951 spent fuel rods to russia for disposal .
according to critics , however , the stakes may be higher this time around .
" we 're dealing with something different , " said tobias muenchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
greater fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian processing facility , mayak , was the site of one of the largest ever nuclear explosions muenchmeyer said that unlike uf6 , which is associated with low radiation levels , " we 're dealing with the spent nuclear fuel from a research reactor in germany , which , like all nuclear waste , also contains plutonium and other fission products and therefore represents incredibly dangerous cargo . "
the fuel rods , from a former east german research reactor near dresden , were originally imported from the soviet union in 1957 and were used until 1991 .
research reactors often use highly enriched material compared to most nuclear power plants – including material that can be used to make atom bombs .
russia and the united states have agreed to take back such waste in order to limit the spread of weapons-grade material and the german state of saxony , which owns the rods , is relying on that agreement to wash its hands of the matter .
because there is no interim storage facility in saxony , the fuel rods were moved in 2005 to ahaus in the state of north rhine-westphalia and saxony has been paying rent for their storage ever since .
" our position is clear , " a spokesperson for saxony 's science ministry said recently , " as long as international conditions are satisfied , then we want to see the material put back where it belongs . "
passing the rod as far as saxony is concerned , ' where it belongs ' is in a russian nuclear facility at mayak , some 150 km south-east of ekaterinburg .
for the opposition greens , though , mayak is anything but a safe repository .
" we know that mayak is highly contaminated , " said sylvia kotting-uhl , greens spokesperson for nuclear policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 german pen association honors chinese dissident liu xiaobo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : award-winning chinese writer liu xiaobo is currently in prison for political reasons incarcerated in china for his subversive political activities , writer and nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo has received a special award from the german pen committee in honor of his achievements . in honor of the writers in prison day on november 15 , the german branch of international writers ' association pen highlighted the plight of persecuted writers around the world , including the nearly 900 journalists and writers who at present are detained in around 100 countries .
one of these writers is chinese nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo , currently incarcerated in china as a political prisoner . chosen as the winner of this year 's hermann kesten medal - a prize awarded annually by pen for outstanding efforts in support of persecuted authors - liu was eagerly awaited by a group of guests at the ceremony in the german city of darmstadt last week , but neither he nor his wife could attend , said the president of the german branch of pen , johano strasser . behind bars at this time , liu is serving time at a jail 450 kilometers north of beijing .
on december 25 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 11 years ' imprisonment on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power . liu was one of the creators of charter 08 - a manifesto initially signed in 2008 by over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in china .
the document currently has around 10,000 signatures and demands rights such as freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and the right to form political parties . tilman spengler , one of the ceremony 's hosts , pointed out that these demands are in full accordance with the chinese constitution , which , at least in theory , guarantees human rights . bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is passionate about advancing democracy and human rights in china theory and reality in china , those who , like liu , actively support human rights , are carefully scrutinized by the authorities .
since the nobel committee announced him as the winner of the peace prize in october , pressure on those who do n't follow the government line in china has increased .
numerous dissidents , including liu 's wife , are under house arrest , have faced interrogations or have been preemptively detained . the chinese government has been doing all it can to keep its citizens away from the nobel peace prize ceremony , which is due to be held on december 10 in oslo .
just recently , china 's authorities prevented liu 's lawyer mo shaoping from leaving the country on allegations of endangering national security .
according to geir lundestad , director of the norwegian nobel institute , it is likely that neither the diploma nor the medal can be awarded , since neither liu nor anyone associated with him will be allowed to attend . ' for the victims ' chinese author and president of the chinese pen center , tianchi martin-liao , accepted the hermann kesten prize on behalf of liu .
she was a logical choice for this role , as the two of them are friends and liu himself is a former president of pen in china . in her emotional acceptance speech , martin-liao described liu 's reaction to the news from the nobel committee .
according to her , the first sentence that the tearful liu uttered was , " this prize is for the victims of the 4th of june 1989 . " for liu , the chinese democratic movement and its brutal end at the tiananmen square massacre was a turning point .
he repeatedly said that he , as a survivor , felt a duty to fight for justice on behalf of those who had been killed in the incident . a mission this sense of duty led to liu 's imprisonment .
but despite the brutal measures taken against him , liu does not see himself as a victim , but rather as a person who was aware of the risks he was facing . " as soon as you have made your decision , you should have an optimistic stance towards the risk and the pressure , with self-confidence and calmness , " said liu in 2007 . in this regard , liu is a worthy recipient of the hermann kesten medal , which is endowed with 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,600 -rrb- .
hermann kesten himself was more famous for his support of other authors than for his writings - and for passionately standing up for persecuted artists in the nazi era . author : matthias von hein -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .

the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

it has also facilitated access to health services in more remote areas through mobile clinics . sensitive issue of naxalite violence naxalite , or maoist , violence in india has claimed the lives of over 10,000 civilians and security personnel in the past five years . the word naxalite comes from the village of naxalbari in west bengal where a left-wing peasant uprising took place in 1967 . tasneem meenai , acting director of the nelson mandela institute of peace and conflict studies , says the decision to allow the icrc into chhattisgarh is welcome . " i feel there is a certain sensitivity attached to internal conflict with respect to the naxal movement .
i would first rather have the icrc first testing the waters and playing the role it is very impartially and objectively expected to play , " she says . " but it has taken a whole lot of time for the icrc to be able to manage .
they are there in kashmir , they visit prisoners in jail , which is one of their major contributions with respect at looking the way prisoners are treated in internal conflicts .
the government has not yet given other organizations this kind of avenue . " icrc does not make findings public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icrc has been providing aid and support in pakistan , which was devastated by floods earlier this year francois stamm points out another reason why other organizations , such as amnesty international and human rights watch , might have had less success entering conflict zones : " the icrc in kashmir , as in guantanamo , israel and other places , will not comment publicly on our findings .

for wednesday 's match , germany 's coach has called up a quartet of dortmunders .
some may being staying in the national squad . on the one hand , it 's a mark of how confident joachim loew is that he 's omitted regulars like mesut oezil , thomas mueller and philipp lahm for the sweden match in goeteborg mid-week .
but a bit of additional quality in the squad is never unwelcome .
in the past , loew has called up young players as a reward for good performances in the domestic league - and as a way of securing their services for germany in future .
wednesday 's squad includes two debutees from dortmund , marcel schmelzer and mario goetze .
in addition , two of their teammates , mats hummels and kevin grosskreutz , are being capped for only the second time .
not every player who gets a call-up goes on to play a meaningful role in the national squad , of course , but each of these players have reason to hope wednesday wo n't be the last time they 'll be donning a germany jersey .
so who are these young players and what are their strengths and future prospects for germany ?
mats hummels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hummels is the bundesliga 's top-rated defender a product of bayern munich 's youth academy , 21-year-old mats hummels was allowed to move to dortmund in 2009 , and some in the bavarian capital probably regret letting him go .
except for a period when he was injured , the central defender has been a permanent part of coach juergen klopp 's starting line-up .
together with neven subotic , he heads the youngest and best defense in the bundesliga .
and central defense is one area that 's up in the air at the moment for the germany squad .
veteran arne friedrich and holger badstuber are currently out with nagging injuries , and neither per mertesacker nor heiko westermann have impressed this season .
at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

wednesday 's squad includes two debutees from dortmund , marcel schmelzer and mario goetze .
in addition , two of their teammates , mats hummels and kevin grosskreutz , are being capped for only the second time .
not every player who gets a call-up goes on to play a meaningful role in the national squad , of course , but each of these players have reason to hope wednesday wo n't be the last time they 'll be donning a germany jersey .
so who are these young players and what are their strengths and future prospects for germany ?
mats hummels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hummels is the bundesliga 's top-rated defender a product of bayern munich 's youth academy , 21-year-old mats hummels was allowed to move to dortmund in 2009 , and some in the bavarian capital probably regret letting him go .
except for a period when he was injured , the central defender has been a permanent part of coach juergen klopp 's starting line-up .
together with neven subotic , he heads the youngest and best defense in the bundesliga .
and central defense is one area that 's up in the air at the moment for the germany squad .
veteran arne friedrich and holger badstuber are currently out with nagging injuries , and neither per mertesacker nor heiko westermann have impressed this season .
at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .

it has focused its attention on jammu and kashmir , but has recently ventured into states affected by maoist violence . for over 15 years , the icrc has been visiting detainees in jammu and kashmir and submitting reports on jail conditions to the authorities . the organization asks to be notified of all arrests related to the conflict in the state and tries to gain access to all places of detention in the conflict-ridden state , including interrogation centers . " our main activity in india is to visit prisoners in the state of jammu and kashmir and we been doing this since 1995 , " explains francois stamm , icrc head of regional delegation . " but now we are investigating new activities in other areas of india affected by affected by armed violence , like for instance chhattisgarh with the naxalite situation .
and we are doing this primarily in cooperation with the health authorities and the indian red cross .
it is ongoing but relatively slow because they are important logistical challenges .

it has also facilitated access to health services in more remote areas through mobile clinics . sensitive issue of naxalite violence naxalite , or maoist , violence in india has claimed the lives of over 10,000 civilians and security personnel in the past five years . the word naxalite comes from the village of naxalbari in west bengal where a left-wing peasant uprising took place in 1967 . tasneem meenai , acting director of the nelson mandela institute of peace and conflict studies , says the decision to allow the icrc into chhattisgarh is welcome . " i feel there is a certain sensitivity attached to internal conflict with respect to the naxal movement .
i would first rather have the icrc first testing the waters and playing the role it is very impartially and objectively expected to play , " she says . " but it has taken a whole lot of time for the icrc to be able to manage .
they are there in kashmir , they visit prisoners in jail , which is one of their major contributions with respect at looking the way prisoners are treated in internal conflicts .
the government has not yet given other organizations this kind of avenue . " icrc does not make findings public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icrc has been providing aid and support in pakistan , which was devastated by floods earlier this year francois stamm points out another reason why other organizations , such as amnesty international and human rights watch , might have had less success entering conflict zones : " the icrc in kashmir , as in guantanamo , israel and other places , will not comment publicly on our findings . " we do not share with anyone but the detaining authorities the conditions of detention or the conditions of treatment that detainees face in prison .

according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen says ireland will be just fine for another year under pressure ewald nowotny , a member of the european central bank 's governing council , said the european union wanted a " quick , good solution to ireland , so that there would be no spill-over " to other heavily indebted countries such as portugal and spain .
ireland has come under pressure from eurozone leaders , who fear the country 's debt crisis could bring down the rest of the bloc .
debt is widespread in the eurozone and the eu , but ireland is currently seen as the weakest link .
portugal also in trouble meanwhile , portugal , which is already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , admitted on monday it was in difficulty , but portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said there were no plans as of yet for lisbon to request emergency funding .
at their monthly meeting in brussels , the eurozone finance ministers are also expected to discuss the future eurozone crisis resolution mechanism , which germany wants to start from 2013 , replacing the 440-billion-euro european financial stability facility set up after greece sought help in may .
the ministers are also expected to praise ireland 's 2011 budget cuts , which face a parliamentary vote of approval next month .
meanwhile , in ireland , finance minister brian lenihan is expected to release details of a new four-year debt-cutting program before the end of the month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 16.11.2010 solar energy , regional politics dominate discussion between germany and morocco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moroccan capital rabat is the site of bilateral german-moroccan talks german foreign minister guido westerwelle is spending the early part of this week in morocco .
he wants to talk about energy , but his hosts have put a different issue on the agenda . the western sahara is an important region for a variety of reasons .
the prevalence of sun makes it an ideal location for solar energy facilities , and the area is rich in phosphate .
the disputed territory is also the subject of a tug-of-war between morocco and the algerian backed sahrawi arab democratic republic -lrb- sadr -rrb- , which wants it to become an independent state .
when german foreign minister guido westerwelle arrived in the moroccan capital on monday for the first day of a three-day visit , he was confronted with the issue .
he chose his words with care .
“ the main thing is that everyone involved places their faith in negotiations and dialogue , ” westerwelle said .
“ what we want to communicate to our partners is the message of non-violence . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is having to tread lightly moroccan foreign minister taieb fassi fihri interpreted that statement as an expression of support for his government 's position vis-a-vis the sahrawi national liberation movement polisario and its algerian backers .
“ you have heard the german foreign minister , who said appeals to violence , such as those unfortunately issued by polisario and algeria , will not lead to a solution , ” fihri said .
“ we greatly value the statement that negotiations are the most important thing . ”
but it is unclear whether dialogue will be sufficient to resolve a conflict that has existed for decades .
fence sitting bildunterschrift : morocco and algeria both have interests in the region the western sahara was part of spain 's african colonies from the late nineteenth-century until 1975 , when the spanish withdrew , and both morocco and mauritania tried to annex the territory .
that drew resistance from polisario , the nationalist movement for the sahrawi , an arab-berber ethnic group of over 250,000 people , who claim to be the original inhabitants of the region .
by 1979 a campaign of violent resistance by polisario , with the backing of algeria , had forced mauritania from the western sahara .
morocco , however , expanded its control , and in 1991 , a un peace-keeping mission succeeded in establishing a ceasefire .
the un has recognized sadr as a representative of western saharans , and a referendum was planned to let them decide between independence or remaining part of morocco with increased autonomy .
that referendum has been stalled , though , for the past two decades .
bildunterschrift : the future of the sahrawi is up in the air morocco voted for germany to be given a two-year seat on the united nations security council .
now rabat would like a political favor in return .
“ we consulted with germany before we presented our autonomy plan , a plan of compromise that fulfills the criteria of the un security council , ” fihri said .
but polisario and algeria would like to see an independent western saharan state , and westerwelle was careful not to throw clear support in one direction or the other .
“ we are not taking sides in this question , ” westerwelle said .
“ we 're a conversation partner , and above all , we place our faith in the mediating role of the united nations . ”
indeed , in morocco , westerwelle is more interested in talking economics than politics .
here comes the sun morocco is one of the few countries in the arab world that does n't produce oil , and rabat is investing heavily in solar energy .
that represents a convergence of influence with germany , which has enormous technical expertise in that area .
bildunterschrift : solar energy is becoming more important in the middle east so westerwelle 's visit is also an opportunity to drum up some business in a country that has traditionally been oriented more toward spain and france .
“ we germans have top technology , and i 'm thinking especially of solar-energy technology , ” westerwelle said .
“ and in cooperation with morocco , we can use this solar technology particularly well .
that also represents a major chance for german companies to do business . ”
underscoring the tight connection between economics , energy and politics is the fact that the head of morocco 's one power utility , ali fassi fihri , is the moroccan foreign minister 's brother .
morocco is currently engaged in a massive solar-energy project that will cost $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euros -rrb- and hopefully provide 38 percent of the country 's energy needs by the year 2020 .
on its own , germany has invested 43 million euros in solar energy in morocco , and the european union has pumped many millions more into the project .
as westerwelle is experiencing first-hand , involvement in moroccan politics is tricky business .
but the rewards are potentially very great .

this will have an impact on german politics , says dw 's peter stützle . germany remains a haven for political stability .
this can by all means be predicted after the christian democrat -lrb- cdu -rrb- party conference .
parties who manipulate resentments against foreigners may win elections in many other european countries - in germany they do n't .
and the cdu has done a lot at its convention in karlsruhe to assure it stays that way .
people 's concerns that might be exploited by right-wing populists elsewhere are taken seriously by the cdu in germany .
there is undeniably a fear among a wide section of society that migrants from other cultures develop parallel societies and can not contribute towards the country 's welfare because of their lack of language skills and education .
the cdu addresses this discomfort , but stays away from populist slogans and focuses on sophisticated statements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu prevents right-wing populists from gaining strength , says stuetzle in short : yes to the immigration of skilled laborers , but only after the country 's unemployed have gotten a chance on the labor market .
migrants who are already living in germany are welcome , but they have to learn the german language and respect the laws and basic values of the majority society .
to christian democrats , that is the balance between multicultural arbitrariness and assimilation .
the cdu convention agreed to follow that line without long-winded discussions .
beforehand , the cdu discussed one question in detail that especially plagued people with strong christian beliefs : should embryos which were conceived outside the womb be screened in order to rule out hereditary diseases before they get implanted ?
two positions - strict rejection and approval for limited cases - were considered in a very serious way .
in the end , a razor-thin majority chose the former .
conservatives across the spectrum stayed at home during national elections a year ago and even more so during federal elections in north rhine-westphalia , because they did n't feel adequately represented by the cdu . by accommodating their needs , the cdu is also playing power games - intent on securing its majority .
but because it also prevents the right-wing populists from gaining strength , it also serves the democratic stability of the biggest country in the heart of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 16.11.2010 deutsche bank 's ackermann is ' european banker of the year ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ackermann has been head of deutsche bank since 2006 josef ackermann is a polarizing figure .
he 's been called everything from ' visionary ' to germany 's ' most-hated manager ' .
now he 's been named ' european banker of the year . '
but the prestigious title has a troubled past . deutsche bank 's ceo josef ackermann has been one of the most looked-to figures of the german banking world throughout the financial crisis .
public perception of him fluctuates : he has been seen as a slick leader capable of leveraging money to get anything he wants , a punching bag to be held responsible for the consequences capitalism , and simply a profit-oriented manager with little social conscience .
but on monday , at the start of the euro finance week in frankfurt , ackermann found himself in the unaccustomed role of a media darling .
he was named " european banker of the year " by a panel of economic journalists who praised his leadership of deutsche bank during troubled times .
" with this prize we want to set a counterpoint to the public perception of josef ackermann in germany , " said hermann-josef knipper , deputy editor-in-chief of the business newspaper handelsblatt .
a persona such as ackermann 's could well be necessary to thrive in the world of international finance .
born in switzerland , ackermann became the first non-german chief executive officer of deutsche bank in 2006 .
since then he has cut loose industry holdings and some 20,000 employees .
a focus on private customers has been replaced with a concentration on larger and more lucrative clients .
in short , ackermann has made himself anything but popular in doing his job .
however , his circle of friends extends to the highest levels of german government .
in 2008 , his invitation from chancellor angela merkel to a dinner at the chancellery in berlin set off a flurry of media speculation about cronyism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : headquartered in frankfurt , deutsche bank maintains an international presence award has mixed history the european banker of the year title was first awarded in 1994 .
previous winners include high-profile policy-makers , such as jean-claude trichet of the european central bank and jean-claude juncker , the prime minister of luxembourg .
winners from the private sector , however , have been associated with scandal and misfortune .
peter wuffli of ubs won the award in 2005 , but two years later he was embarrassingly ousted from his position as ceo for taking excessive risks .
the royal bank of scotland 's fred goodwin – known as " fred the shred " for his aggressive job cutting strategy – won the award in 2003 , but stepped down from his position in 2008 after leading his bank into crisis .
udo steffens , president of the frankfurt school of finance , says ackermann deserves his award and is unlikely to suffer a similar fall from grace .
" ackermann , together with his management team , steered deutsche bank through the crisis relatively unscathed , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that is a very excellent feat of management . "
deutsche bank maintains an international presence like no other german bank , according to steffens .
" it 's vital for an industrialized nation like germany to have such a bank , " he said .
" despite all of the criticism , germans should be proud to have such a bank in their country . "

in fact , germany has sent shipments of nuclear waste to russia several times in the past .
up until 2009 , one firm regularly exported uranium hexafluoride , or uf6 , from a fuel rod treatment facility in gronau .
uf6 is a by-product created when uranium is enriched , and in order to avoid legal difficulties associated with disposing radioactive waste , the company rebranded its by-product as a resource to be sent to russia for processing .
the deliveries were stopped in 2009 , partly as a result of fierce protests .
now , the export of german nuclear waste to russia is back on the cards , as the german government considers an application to export 951 spent fuel rods to russia for disposal .
according to critics , however , the stakes may be higher this time around .
" we 're dealing with something different , " said tobias muenchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
greater fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian processing facility , mayak , was the site of one of the largest ever nuclear explosions muenchmeyer said that unlike uf6 , which is associated with low radiation levels , " we 're dealing with the spent nuclear fuel from a research reactor in germany , which , like all nuclear waste , also contains plutonium and other fission products and therefore represents incredibly dangerous cargo . "
the fuel rods , from a former east german research reactor near dresden , were originally imported from the soviet union in 1957 and were used until 1991 .
research reactors often use highly enriched material compared to most nuclear power plants – including material that can be used to make atom bombs .
russia and the united states have agreed to take back such waste in order to limit the spread of weapons-grade material and the german state of saxony , which owns the rods , is relying on that agreement to wash its hands of the matter .
because there is no interim storage facility in saxony , the fuel rods were moved in 2005 to ahaus in the state of north rhine-westphalia and saxony has been paying rent for their storage ever since .
" our position is clear , " a spokesperson for saxony 's science ministry said recently , " as long as international conditions are satisfied , then we want to see the material put back where it belongs . "
passing the rod as far as saxony is concerned , ' where it belongs ' is in a russian nuclear facility at mayak , some 150 km south-east of ekaterinburg .
for the opposition greens , though , mayak is anything but a safe repository .
" we know that mayak is highly contaminated , " said sylvia kotting-uhl , greens spokesperson for nuclear policy .
" we also know that mayak is not operated with anything like the same philosophy of safety that is considered standard here in germany .
so to move the waste fuel rods there is incredibly negligent . "
mayak – or ' lighthouse ' – is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union , and was also home , in 1957 , to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
some experts consider mayak 's environment to be more polluted than that of chernobyl , the site of the soviet union 's worst nuclear accident .
germany 's environment ministry , which confirmed that it had received an application to export the waste after press reports first uncovered the story last week , is responsible for determining whether such an export would be legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent transport of nuclear waste to gorleben , in northern germany , sparked mass protests setting a precedent an environment ministry spokesperson said that it would " only make a decision after careful consideration of questions over the safety of the russian site mayak . "
if the experts decide that mayak is safe , little will stand between the waste and its final repository .
the environment ministry has confirmed that a delivery contract has already been drawn up between germany and russia , ready to be signed .
this has left anti-nuclear groups and the opposition concerned , and only in part because they believe the 349 kilograms of plutonium will not be stored safely if they do make their way to mayak .
some fear the export could create a precedent , and encourage nations like russia to trade nuclear waste for cash .
greenpeace 's thomas muenchmeyer says that russians have extended such offers to accept waste in the past , but that " few of those have been official so far . "
he says south korea and taiwan are also potentially interested in such trades , but these are " still – thankfully - completely taboo in europe . "
the european union 's energy chief , guenther oettinger , recently announced plans to introduce a europe-wide ban on the export of nuclear waste .
the announcement was welcomed cautiously by anti-nuclear campaigners , who are concerned that it could contain loopholes when it comes to the export of ' resources ' like uf6 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de social media -pipe- 16.11.2010 facebook 's new messaging feature raises privacy questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the social media site has more than 500 million users facebook is entering the e-mail business with a new feature , but do n't call it e-mail !
and some are wondering if the social network 's privacy policies are strong enough . at a press conference in san francisco , california on monday , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg unveiled the latest of the social networking platform ’ s innovations , facebook messages .
with this announcement , facebook , which counts more than 500 million users , is pushing into google 's turf with this e-mail-like service .
although zuckerberg would be quick to say messages is not e-mail , facebook users will have an @ facebook.com address once the system is released , so it definitely looks similar .
one of the features of messages highlighted in the press conference is its archival function , basically storing all records of messages sent between parties .
given some of facebook 's history with privacy issues , this feature could create some discomfort for less public users .
a digital shoebox facebook 's messaging system has always been integral to the platform , providing users with a slightly less public forum for discussion than publishing everything on " facebook walls , " the bulletin boards that display the activities of a user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook 's latest plans have created a media stir with messages , zuckerberg says the concept is to " flatten " the landscape of communication .
teens , he said at the press conference , prefer sms over e-mail because the latter is too slow , whereas others strictly use e-mail or instant messaging to talk to their friends and family .
so facebook intends to use messages to aggregate these three different means of communication into one conversation .
one user may send an sms , another might reply with an e-mail , but both messages appear on facebook as part of a conversation .
the result , facebook says , will be a continuous collection of conversation history between friends .
the image used in promotional material by facebook is that messages will be analogous to the boxes of letters people once used to collect and cherish , as a way to remember the course of a relationship .
but what about privacy ?
as the new system is gradually rolled out , users will be able to send and receive e-mails with their new @ facebook.com e-mail address .
at first , facebook users will only receive mail from their facebook friends , with all other mail going into an other or a junk mail folder .
but users may " promote " mail from these folders to their primary folders if they wish .
the conversation history will be stored on facebook , which could raise security concerns for some .
when asked about an option for " off the record " conversations at the press conference , zuckerberg responded that users would have the option to delete threads or messages , but that " off the record " does n't make sense .
in the past , facebook has weathered criticism for some of the wording in their terms of use , which in february 2009 , briefly seemed to state that facebook would own any content a user uploaded to the public site , in perpetuity .
facebook and zuckerberg quickly moved to douse the flames of public outcry and released a new terms of use with the section on privacy right up at the top which states , " you own all of the content and information you post on facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings . "
you ca n't win -lrb- or lose -rrb- if you do n't play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to the user to decide how much to reveal it is in facebook 's best interest to have as much sharing and openness between people as possible , because it is in the business of creating connections between people -lrb- and brands -rrb- .
but of course , phishers and scam artists see that sort of openness and the plethora of personal information as an all-you-can-eat buffet and facebook can be dangerous waters for the uninitiated in internet security .
as the social media news hub mashable pointed out , a record of saved e-mail conversations is nothing new .
most people 's e-mail clients are clogged with old conversations , but mashable thinks that having a written record of all communication in proximity to the host of potentially personal information within facebook , could make for a dangerous mixture .
but the bottom line is that facebook , or any potential scam artists trying to take advantage of the data facebook contains , can only hurt users to the extent that they have shared important information with facebook .
of course , the more information a user gives facebook , the more complete , and perhaps rewarding , a user ’ s experience can be , but similarly , the more exposed they are .

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .
" the last email which was sent -lsb- by police -rsb- told israilov to call the emergency number if needed … seven days later he was murdered . "
a witness silenced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israilov was a witness before the european court for human rights israilov filed charges against kadyrov after fleeing the chechen republic in 2006 , claiming to have witnessed killings and tortures conducted by kadyrov and his paramilitary forces .
he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .
the case was eventually dropped after israilov and his father disappeared into hiding and could n't be reached for further questioning .
israilov 's widow is reported to be living in austria with her four children .
his father , who is said to have fled europe in fear of his life , was expected to return to vienna for the court hearing under heavy security presence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disarmament -pipe- 16.11.2010 white house pushes for start , but ratification remains uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the start treaty would cut us and russian nuclear arsenals with ratification of the new start treaty only likely to be more difficult when the next congress takes office in 2011 , the white house is pushing for a vote in the lame-duck senate .
but success is all but sure . on sunday , us president barack obama and his cabinet launched a coordinated public relations blitz aimed at rallying support for the ratification of the nuclear disarmament pact washington had negotiated with moscow .
following a meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev on the sidelines of the apec economic summit in seoul , obama promised to get the us-russian nuclear arms reduction deal passed before the new congress takes office next year .
" i reiterated my commitment to get the start treaty done during the lame duck session , and i 've communicated to congress that it is a top priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original treaty was signed by george bush and mikhail gorbachev in 1991 one day later , on monday , us secretary of state , hillary clinton , and defense secretary robert gates followed up with a op-ed article in the washington post , urging congress to quickly ratify the so-called new start treaty - the successor of the original start initiated by president ronald reagan , which expired at the end of last year .
under the headline " we ca n't delay this treaty , " clinton and gates made the case for congress to pass the treaty , arguing that " our national security depends on it . " high stakes the full-court press by the obama administration highlights both the importance and the stakes for ratification of new start that would limit american and russian strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 respectively , and improve the verification regime .
but analysts are skeptical as to whether the joint appeal by obama , clinton and gates will be enough to persuade republicans to vote for the new start pact .
some republican lawmakers believe the treaty weakens the us , while others feel strongly that the newly elected senate should be given a chance to vote on the pact .
still others are loathe to give obama a victory in his lame-duck session , and are looking to renegotiate the treaty entirely . ratification requires a two-third majority , or 67 votes in the us senate .
democrats can command 59 votes in the current senate ; in the next senate they will only control 53 votes .
" i think it is doubtful that this extremely important step will be taken by the united states , " said karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at harvard university .
" the atmosphere of hostility and partisanship in the united states is such that the vote that the senate foreign relations committee took - where a majority actually voted in favor of the treaty - i do not think can be repeated .
even in a lame-duck session , ” kaiser told deutsche welle .
while some senior republican foreign-policy experts , such as richard lugar , support start and want to help get it passed , others want to renegotiate the deal or think a vote should be taken by the new congress .
political football ?
the treaty is a solid , if not overly ambitious agreement , and it should be ratified since it would increase us national security , argues patricia lewis , deputy director of the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratification will only become tougher when the new senate is sworn in " if it gets turned into political football between two parties in the country and has nothing to do with the larger and wider security issues then who is to know what will happen , " lewis told deutsche welle .
she added : " i really hope that it does get ratified and as soon as possible .
because right now there are no inspections on strategic weapons .
we want to move ahead with better and more wide-ranging cuts with the russians , and doing that if this is n't ratified would be very difficult . "
in light of its experience with the comprehensive test ban treaty , which moscow ratified and the us did n't , russia said this time around that it would only ratify new start after washington had done so .
therefore , according to kaiser , " a setback would also be very bad for the long-term goal of getting rid of all nuclear weapons and non-proliferation . "
and lewis said that if the us does n't ratify the treaty , " the trust in the united states as a negotiating partner , as a partner with whom you can do business , as a partner who can give their word and keep their word ... becomes further diminished .
that would be a real pity . "
europe 's role lewis and kaiser have different opinions as to how much influence europe and the rest of the world can have on the ratification of the treaty .
" i think the entire world will disagree if the treaty does n't get ratified because this is literally what everybody has wanted , " argues kaiser , who believes europe has n't done enough to support the ratification of the deal .
" it is not enough to simply agree with the vision of a non-nuclear world .
that 's very popular in europe .
nor is it enough to just argue you have to get rid of tactical nuclear weapons , as a number of europeans countries have done , " kaiser said .
according to kaiser , europe needs to give signals to the americans " at the highest political levels , notably the senate , " that the world expects american leadership in this matter .
but for her part , lewis is n't sure how useful it is to put more international pressure on the us .
" the united states is a democracy .
and this is very much a debate within the united states democracy , " she said . " it 's a debate for the senate to have .
i think there is a limit to which other countries can have a huge impact on domestic debates . "

it has focused its attention on jammu and kashmir , but has recently ventured into states affected by maoist violence . for over 15 years , the icrc has been visiting detainees in jammu and kashmir and submitting reports on jail conditions to the authorities . the organization asks to be notified of all arrests related to the conflict in the state and tries to gain access to all places of detention in the conflict-ridden state , including interrogation centers . " our main activity in india is to visit prisoners in the state of jammu and kashmir and we been doing this since 1995 , " explains francois stamm , icrc head of regional delegation . " but now we are investigating new activities in other areas of india affected by affected by armed violence , like for instance chhattisgarh with the naxalite situation .
and we are doing this primarily in cooperation with the health authorities and the indian red cross .
it is ongoing but relatively slow because they are important logistical challenges . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tribals have become caught in the fight between naxalites and the indian army the icrc has concentrated on improving the medical referral system , by supporting ambulance services and providing first aid training .
it has also facilitated access to health services in more remote areas through mobile clinics . sensitive issue of naxalite violence naxalite , or maoist , violence in india has claimed the lives of over 10,000 civilians and security personnel in the past five years . the word naxalite comes from the village of naxalbari in west bengal where a left-wing peasant uprising took place in 1967 . tasneem meenai , acting director of the nelson mandela institute of peace and conflict studies , says the decision to allow the icrc into chhattisgarh is welcome . " i feel there is a certain sensitivity attached to internal conflict with respect to the naxal movement .
i would first rather have the icrc first testing the waters and playing the role it is very impartially and objectively expected to play , " she says . " but it has taken a whole lot of time for the icrc to be able to manage .
they are there in kashmir , they visit prisoners in jail , which is one of their major contributions with respect at looking the way prisoners are treated in internal conflicts .
the government has not yet given other organizations this kind of avenue . " icrc does not make findings public bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the icrc has been providing aid and support in pakistan , which was devastated by floods earlier this year francois stamm points out another reason why other organizations , such as amnesty international and human rights watch , might have had less success entering conflict zones : " the icrc in kashmir , as in guantanamo , israel and other places , will not comment publicly on our findings . " we do not share with anyone but the detaining authorities the conditions of detention or the conditions of treatment that detainees face in prison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 french senate passes new e-book law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed law would affect books sold for the kindle , ipad the bill , which is expected to pass the national assembly later this month , would let publishers set e-book prices .
the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen says ireland will be just fine for another year under pressure ewald nowotny , a member of the european central bank 's governing council , said the european union wanted a " quick , good solution to ireland , so that there would be no spill-over " to other heavily indebted countries such as portugal and spain .
ireland has come under pressure from eurozone leaders , who fear the country 's debt crisis could bring down the rest of the bloc .
debt is widespread in the eurozone and the eu , but ireland is currently seen as the weakest link .
portugal also in trouble meanwhile , portugal , which is already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , admitted on monday it was in difficulty , but portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said there were no plans as of yet for lisbon to request emergency funding .
at their monthly meeting in brussels , the eurozone finance ministers are also expected to discuss the future eurozone crisis resolution mechanism , which germany wants to start from 2013 , replacing the 440-billion-euro european financial stability facility set up after greece sought help in may .
the ministers are also expected to praise ireland 's 2011 budget cuts , which face a parliamentary vote of approval next month .
meanwhile , in ireland , finance minister brian lenihan is expected to release details of a new four-year debt-cutting program before the end of the month .

one of these writers is chinese nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo , currently incarcerated in china as a political prisoner . chosen as the winner of this year 's hermann kesten medal - a prize awarded annually by pen for outstanding efforts in support of persecuted authors - liu was eagerly awaited by a group of guests at the ceremony in the german city of darmstadt last week , but neither he nor his wife could attend , said the president of the german branch of pen , johano strasser . behind bars at this time , liu is serving time at a jail 450 kilometers north of beijing .
on december 25 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 11 years ' imprisonment on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power . liu was one of the creators of charter 08 - a manifesto initially signed in 2008 by over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in china .
the document currently has around 10,000 signatures and demands rights such as freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and the right to form political parties . tilman spengler , one of the ceremony 's hosts , pointed out that these demands are in full accordance with the chinese constitution , which , at least in theory , guarantees human rights . bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is passionate about advancing democracy and human rights in china theory and reality in china , those who , like liu , actively support human rights , are carefully scrutinized by the authorities .
since the nobel committee announced him as the winner of the peace prize in october , pressure on those who do n't follow the government line in china has increased .
numerous dissidents , including liu 's wife , are under house arrest , have faced interrogations or have been preemptively detained . the chinese government has been doing all it can to keep its citizens away from the nobel peace prize ceremony , which is due to be held on december 10 in oslo .
just recently , china 's authorities prevented liu 's lawyer mo shaoping from leaving the country on allegations of endangering national security .
according to geir lundestad , director of the norwegian nobel institute , it is likely that neither the diploma nor the medal can be awarded , since neither liu nor anyone associated with him will be allowed to attend . ' for the victims ' chinese author and president of the chinese pen center , tianchi martin-liao , accepted the hermann kesten prize on behalf of liu .
she was a logical choice for this role , as the two of them are friends and liu himself is a former president of pen in china . in her emotional acceptance speech , martin-liao described liu 's reaction to the news from the nobel committee .
according to her , the first sentence that the tearful liu uttered was , " this prize is for the victims of the 4th of june 1989 . " for liu , the chinese democratic movement and its brutal end at the tiananmen square massacre was a turning point .
he repeatedly said that he , as a survivor , felt a duty to fight for justice on behalf of those who had been killed in the incident . a mission this sense of duty led to liu 's imprisonment .
but despite the brutal measures taken against him , liu does not see himself as a victim , but rather as a person who was aware of the risks he was facing . " as soon as you have made your decision , you should have an optimistic stance towards the risk and the pressure , with self-confidence and calmness , " said liu in 2007 . in this regard , liu is a worthy recipient of the hermann kesten medal , which is endowed with 10,000 euros -lrb- $ 13,600 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 16.11.2010 eu steps up the pressure on irish banks , opens talks with imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks in ireland could use a few more irish euro coins for the first time , the european commission has hinted at a possible economic rescue for ireland .
the eu 's economy commissioner said the bloc was in talks with the imf on tackling problems in the irish banking sector . the european union on tuesday announced it is in talks with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- about taking on growing problems in ireland 's banking sector .
eu economy commissioner olli rehn said ahead of a meeting with eurozone finance ministers in brussels that ireland 's banking crisis was " the most pressing problem " facing the monetary union . meanwhile , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who headed tuesday 's talks by the panel of financial ministers known as the eurogroup , vowed to protect the 16-nation euro currency . juncker urged that the irish government would have to decide on financial aid , with inevitable strings attached , within days .
however , he stressed that no aid could be given if ireland did not request it . " the discussions that will take place between ireland and the -lsb- european -rsb- commission and the ecb and the imf will enable us to have at our disposal all the elements and instruments we need were ireland to make a request for assistance to the eu , the imf and the europgroup , " juncker told reporters . euro ' not threatened ' solvency concerns have grown in ireland after a 45 billion euro -lrb- $ 61 billion -rrb- bailout for private banks increased its deficit in 2010 to 32 percent of gross domestic product .
however , rehn also pointed out that the crisis in ireland was limited to its banking sector , and that the government was " funded well until the middle of next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn says ireland 's banking crisis is the eurozone 's biggest problem rehn cautioned against alarmism , saying the irish debt crisis was " not a matter of survival for the euro . "
german chancellor angela merkel repeated this assurance tuesday evening , telling ard public television she did not believe the eurozone to be in danger , but that the bloc was " experiencing turmoil and situations of the kind i would n't have dreamed of a year and a half ago , " merkel added .
rumor mill irish prime minister brian cowen meanwhile sought to dispel rumors in an address to parliament tuesday that ireland had already applied for an additional bailout for its banks .
" we have not applied to any facility .
despite the fact that it was being mentioned in a lot of so-called reputable news organizations does not make it any truer , " cowen said . he said ireland was discussing with the eu about ways to normalize market conditions and was attempting to ensure that any decisions were also in the interest of stabilizing the eurozone . a financial crisis in greece that similarly threatened the euro forced it to accept a rescue package on a larger scale earlier this year , which came with many conditions from the eu and imf . waiting on ireland bildunterschrift : ireland 's banking problems are seen as a euro threat ireland 's reluctance to accept a rescue package may be to avoid similar conditions in an effort to solve its banking crisis on its own .
however , newspaper reports in the country suggested ireland was moving closer to a bailout as the eu piled on the pressure .
" to fend off being forced into a bailout for the entire state , finance minister brian lenihan is poised to agree to a bank injection to stabilize the euro and calm markets , " the irish independent reported , citing an unnamed source .
ca n't ' throw money from helicopters ' meanwhile in a visit to rome , germany 's economy minister rainer bruederle said " throwing money from helicopters " was not a solution to fixing economic problems .
the economic phrase refers to a practice where a government simply creates money until the economy gets going again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle says money should n't be ' thrown from helicopters ' bruederle said countries like ireland or greece should implement reforms to reduce deficits in order to eliminate the need for future bailouts .
" the european community as a whole has an interest in finding a way to have guarantees of a solution when there are difficulties , " he said .
meanwhile , the ecb is currently channeling about a quarter of its loans into irish banks , and ireland has put the figure required to save its financial institutions at around 50 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 16.11.2010 christian democrats vote in favor of embryo screening ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu voted to oppose the pre-screening of an embryo in order to check for diseases chancellor merkel 's cdu party has voted to ban pre-implantation genetic diagnosis , which could detect serious illnesses in embryos .
the party also wants to introduce stricter rules for foreigners who refuse to integrate . at its annual party conference , german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on tuesday voted to ban the screening of embryos used in ivf treatment .
a tight majority of 51 percent of the delegates voted to retain existing policy on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
policy from 2007 allows in vitro fertilization but makes it illegal to check the cells for hereditary diseases .
chancellor merkel had been pushing the ban in the run-up to the convention in karlsruhe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was among those who favor a ban " i favor a pgd ban because i am concerned that we can not define its limits properly , " merkel said on monday .
the issue is of key importance to the party as the cdu has , by definition , to uphold christian values .
according to mainstream christian teaching , life begins at conception .
deep divisions the party is however deeply divided over the issue , and the conference experienced an emotional debate lasting more than three hours .
for many , the memory of the nazis administering lethal injections to handicapped children forbids embryo screening in modern germany .
" if life is a gift from god , it is not given with any condition , " julia kloeckner , leader of cdu in the state of rhineland palatinate said .
" it would be disturbing for doctors to decide which embryos should be allowed to live by saying ' you 're okay , you 're not , " ' she added .
a lesser evil compared to still births and abortions but to delegates in favor of restricted pgd use , pre-screening would be the lesser evil compared to still births and abortions .
" there is a difference between an embryo before and after -lsb- implantation in the womb -rsb- has taken place , " said minister for family affairs kristina schroeder .
other cdu delegates agree .
according to peter hintze , deputy economics minister , it does not make sense that numerous examinations of the fetus inside the womb are allowed , but examinations of the embryo in a petri dish are not .
" pgd would not mean the creation of a designer baby , ” hintze , a protestant theologian , said .
" whoever believes the desire for a blue-eyed baby would lead anyone to undergo ivf , does not meet reality at all . "
jens spahn , cdu 's expert on health matters , did not believe that pre-screening techniques will be limited to serious diseases only .
legislation expected in july , the federal court of justice ruled that pgd is currently exempt from punishment .
in the coming weeks , the german parliament , the bundestag , will decide whether pgd should be banned by law .
tuesday ’ s decision might dissuade some cdu delegates from voting against the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded a debate on pgd justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the cdu 's coalition partner the fdp , criticized the decision and said a debate was needed in order to define strict guidelines for the use of pgd .
many of her party colleagues demand a limited usage of the technique .
other european nations such as britain , france , belgium and denmark already permit the screening .
integration policy the cdu also decided on stricter rules for foreigners who are not willing to integrate .
chancellor merkel recently declared multiculturalism to have failed and the conference agreed to pursue an integration policy that was in the " interests of germany " and an end to the " politics of misunderstood tolerance . "
" those rules are actually quite simple .
whoever wants to live here has to learn german .
whoever lives here has to respect our laws and values , " merkel said .
" those who do not follow the rules can expect to face sanctions . "

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 16.11.2010 mecca journal : sleepless in mecca großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw reporter ali almakhlafi in his new hajj outfit after staying up all night , dw reporter ali almakhlafi is now wearing his new pilgrim 's garment .
in today ’ s segment he explains how fast a shopping mall can be turned into a prayer room . i 'm now wearing official hajj attire !
and i 'm curious to get reactions about how i look in my new outfit .
so please check out my pictures .
i ’ m pretty sure it will get a smile out of some of my friends and readers .
but that 's okay , because in my opinion , islam should also be about humor and the joy of life . here in mecca , i experience humor and the joy of life every day – even in the middle of huge crowds of people .
during a bus trip with pilgrims from austria , italy , brazil , and china all of us had some time to joke around in english which is our common language here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying pilgrims it reminds me of my time as a student in damascus , where i and other international students lived with an arabic-catholic family .
of course , here all of us are muslims and the atmosphere is quite spiritual .
the other pilgrims are praying to god , they 're praying in the bus even when it turns a sharp corner .
but every once in a while during the ride we just shoot the breeze . today is the feast of sacrifice – the day when muslims commemorate prophet ibrahim -lrb- abraham -rrb- , who 's also worshiped by christians and jews .
according to islamic tradition , he was willing to sacrifice his son to god .
but god refused his offering and a lamb was sacrificed instead .
the story lead to a religious ritual : every believing muslim who can afford it is supposed to sacrifice an animal on the feast of sacrifice and then give its meat to the hungry and the poor .
in mecca , as you can imagine , this is taking place on a large scale . prayers in the shopping mall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali almakhlafi at the kaaba but let me tell you about another intriguing sight i came across at the al-haram mosque .
right next to it , you can now find what is said to be the largest clock in the world .
it 's more than 600 meters high .
it 's absolutely breathtaking – i really have never seen anything like it in my entire life ! equally astonishing to me was the fact there ’ s starbucks coffee shop just next to the kaaba .
also close by are a number of shopping malls and if the mosque is full , pilgrims simply venture over to shopping malls to pray . in one of those malls , i met layali and farid – a couple from vienna .
for layali it ’ s her second hajj and she 's really excited about it .
in the middle of all the glittering shops and stores of the mall she tells me : " material things have no relevance here .
you really feel close to god and you understand how small you really are in relation to it all . "
after telling me that , she does n't want to give any more interviews close to the kaaba : " i want to focus on god exclusively . " i understand that , of course .
instead , i turn to farid who says he has found his spiritual home at mecca , but adds that " i 'm a real austrian – austria is my homeland . "
moments later , layali and farid vanish in the crowd . sleepless in mecca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at namira mosque in arafat make no mistake , a pilgrimage is not a cakewalk .
last night i have been up and awake the whole night . the day before , pilgrims prayed at the mountain of forgiveness and then travelled to mina in order to collect stones for the symbolic stoning of the devil . all of that made me think about a question posted by dw user thomas pudelko , who said that he had heard that the technical infrastructure in mecca has been built with german support and asked whether this had a negative impact on the spiritual atmosphere . no , i really do n't think it does .
the spiritual atmosphere is very intense and very impressive .
and many people i meet say that the security has really gotten a lot better with the help of german engineers . in muzdalifah , the only stage of the hajj where pilgrims spend their night outside , i dearly missed “ good old german " organizational skills : it took us a three hours to get only a couple of kilometers ahead .
and when we arrived , there was complete and utter chaos with hundreds of thousands of people running around aimlessly all over the place .
even worse , an old man got hit by a bus .
i only hope he survived ! answering the dw users " how do you find your way through the crowd ? " asked dw english user sandhya moirangthem .
that 's a good question , sandhya .
i was n't really sure myself before i got here , but i learned pretty quickly .
most of the time the old rule applies : just follow the crowd . on the facebook page of dw arabic , yuir boston asked me to describe the life and daily routine in mecca apart from the hajj .
dear yuri , besides the area of the kaaba mosque , a lot of the places and hajj-sites are abandoned and empty for most of the year – there 's simply no one there , only the desert .
i will describe the daily routine in saudi arabia in more detail after my return . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is supposedly the world 's largest clock how do saudi authorities make sure there are only muslims attending the hajj is a question posted by dw user " derks145 " .
well , you need a special hajj-visa in order to get here in the first place .
in most cases , you can tell the muslim background by the names , too .
whenever there are any doubts , saudi authorities also ask for proof in the form of certificates issued , for example , by a muslim community . and here 's one more question posted by user judith puppe from germany : " how much is the hajj for muslims ? "
well , i asked around and suppose it 's about 3000 euros .
but i 'm not sure about that really . after not sleeping any last night , i will now attend the feast of sacrifice and the symbolic stoning of the devil .
what ’ s more , pilgrims will also have their hair cut .
so there are lots more interesting experiences to come in my next diary entries .
for today i ’ ll end with this : happy feast of sacrifice to all my readers – muslims or non-muslims ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in today ’ s segment he explains how fast a shopping mall can be turned into a prayer room . i 'm now wearing official hajj attire !
and i 'm curious to get reactions about how i look in my new outfit .
so please check out my pictures .
i ’ m pretty sure it will get a smile out of some of my friends and readers .
but that 's okay , because in my opinion , islam should also be about humor and the joy of life . here in mecca , i experience humor and the joy of life every day – even in the middle of huge crowds of people .
during a bus trip with pilgrims from austria , italy , brazil , and china all of us had some time to joke around in english which is our common language here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : praying pilgrims it reminds me of my time as a student in damascus , where i and other international students lived with an arabic-catholic family .
of course , here all of us are muslims and the atmosphere is quite spiritual .
the other pilgrims are praying to god , they 're praying in the bus even when it turns a sharp corner .
but every once in a while during the ride we just shoot the breeze . today is the feast of sacrifice – the day when muslims commemorate prophet ibrahim -lrb- abraham -rrb- , who 's also worshiped by christians and jews .
according to islamic tradition , he was willing to sacrifice his son to god .
but god refused his offering and a lamb was sacrificed instead .
the story lead to a religious ritual : every believing muslim who can afford it is supposed to sacrifice an animal on the feast of sacrifice and then give its meat to the hungry and the poor .
in mecca , as you can imagine , this is taking place on a large scale . prayers in the shopping mall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali almakhlafi at the kaaba but let me tell you about another intriguing sight i came across at the al-haram mosque .
right next to it , you can now find what is said to be the largest clock in the world .
it 's more than 600 meters high .
it 's absolutely breathtaking – i really have never seen anything like it in my entire life ! equally astonishing to me was the fact there ’ s starbucks coffee shop just next to the kaaba .
also close by are a number of shopping malls and if the mosque is full , pilgrims simply venture over to shopping malls to pray . in one of those malls , i met layali and farid – a couple from vienna .
for layali it ’ s her second hajj and she 's really excited about it .
in the middle of all the glittering shops and stores of the mall she tells me : " material things have no relevance here .
you really feel close to god and you understand how small you really are in relation to it all . "
after telling me that , she does n't want to give any more interviews close to the kaaba : " i want to focus on god exclusively . " i understand that , of course .
instead , i turn to farid who says he has found his spiritual home at mecca , but adds that " i 'm a real austrian – austria is my homeland . "
moments later , layali and farid vanish in the crowd . sleepless in mecca bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at namira mosque in arafat make no mistake , a pilgrimage is not a cakewalk .
last night i have been up and awake the whole night . the day before , pilgrims prayed at the mountain of forgiveness and then travelled to mina in order to collect stones for the symbolic stoning of the devil . all of that made me think about a question posted by dw user thomas pudelko , who said that he had heard that the technical infrastructure in mecca has been built with german support and asked whether this had a negative impact on the spiritual atmosphere . no , i really do n't think it does .
the spiritual atmosphere is very intense and very impressive .
and many people i meet say that the security has really gotten a lot better with the help of german engineers . in muzdalifah , the only stage of the hajj where pilgrims spend their night outside , i dearly missed “ good old german " organizational skills : it took us a three hours to get only a couple of kilometers ahead .
and when we arrived , there was complete and utter chaos with hundreds of thousands of people running around aimlessly all over the place .
even worse , an old man got hit by a bus .
i only hope he survived ! answering the dw users " how do you find your way through the crowd ? " asked dw english user sandhya moirangthem .
that 's a good question , sandhya .
i was n't really sure myself before i got here , but i learned pretty quickly .
most of the time the old rule applies : just follow the crowd . on the facebook page of dw arabic , yuir boston asked me to describe the life and daily routine in mecca apart from the hajj .
dear yuri , besides the area of the kaaba mosque , a lot of the places and hajj-sites are abandoned and empty for most of the year – there 's simply no one there , only the desert .
i will describe the daily routine in saudi arabia in more detail after my return . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is supposedly the world 's largest clock how do saudi authorities make sure there are only muslims attending the hajj is a question posted by dw user " derks145 " .
well , you need a special hajj-visa in order to get here in the first place .
in most cases , you can tell the muslim background by the names , too .
whenever there are any doubts , saudi authorities also ask for proof in the form of certificates issued , for example , by a muslim community . and here 's one more question posted by user judith puppe from germany : " how much is the hajj for muslims ? "
well , i asked around and suppose it 's about 3000 euros .
but i 'm not sure about that really . after not sleeping any last night , i will now attend the feast of sacrifice and the symbolic stoning of the devil .
what ’ s more , pilgrims will also have their hair cut .
so there are lots more interesting experiences to come in my next diary entries .
for today i ’ ll end with this : happy feast of sacrifice to all my readers – muslims or non-muslims ! author : ali almakhlafi -lrb- ds -rrb- editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the delay could severely threaten the fledgling european diplomatic service , which is due to begin work on january 1 . the european union has failed to agree on a budget for 2011 , missing a self-imposed deadline of midnight on monday .
the deadlock centered on disagreements between the european parliament and representatives of the 27 member states ' national governments .
the breakdown came despite an existing consensus on the actual budget numbers .
last week , the european parliament bowed to pressure from national governments by agreeing to increase next year 's budget by only 2.9 percent , less than half of the increase that it had asked for .
but member states balked at parliament 's call for more power in shaping of budget over the next decade .
european parliament president jerzy buzek called the failure to agree on a new budget " bad news . "
new projects threaten funding difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be forced to operate next year using 2010 figures buzek indicated that " some member states " were to blame for the breakdown - particularly the united kingdom , sweden and the netherlands .
eu diplomats , however , said the parliament had made demands that had nothing to do with the new budget . the delay severely threatens planned institutions , including the european external action service -lrb- ead -rrb- , a new diplomatic service due to begin work at the start of next year , and the iter experimental nuclear reactor in southern france " this is an unfortunate failure , " said the chairman of the budget committee , alain lamassoure .
" but there are still a few weeks until the end of the year . "
the lawmakers are due to continue their talks on the 2011 budget and the future financing of the eu at next month 's summit , scheduled for december 16-17 . if a deal still can not be reached , the eu will be forced to operate using the 2010 budget on a monthly basis . the eu 's budget commissioner , janusz lewandowski , warned the warring sides not to gloss over the implications failing to reach consensus " i do n't want to be overdramatic ... but do not underestimate all the problems , " lewandowski said , adding that burden for subsidies due to be paid in january would fall to the member states . author : sarah harman -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de france -pipe- 16.11.2010 sarkozy goes on tv to defend new government and conservative agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy defended the reshuffle french president nicolas sarkozy has defended his new government to the french people in a televised interview .
though facing record unpopularity , sarkozy maintained that some ministers still have his trust . facing record-low approval , french president nicolas sarkozy used a televised interview tuesday to defend his reorganized government and his conservative agenda to the french people . the french president also renewed his call for global financial reform on the heels of a g20 summit in seoul , where he took over the group ’ s leadership . " we can no longer stay in this monetary mess … we need a new international monetary system , " he said , confirming that china would host a conference on the matter in early 2011 " to see if we can move forward . ” reshuffle defended a major portion of sarkozy ’ s interview on three french tv channels focused on his reappointment of french prime minister francois fillon and changes made to his cabinet . sarkozy had quite some explaining to do , with one opinion poll on monday showing 64 percent of france already mistrusted the new government . sarkozy rebuilt his cabinet this past weekend , firing several center-right and left-leaning ministers and filling their posts with faithful allies .
sarkozy also gave the cabinet a trim , leaving 31 ministers where there had previously been 37 . fillon too popular to be ousted sarkozy told his interviewers that fillon was still " the best prime minister for france . ” " when i asked francois fillon to continue , it 's because i have great trust in him , because he 's very competent , because we 've worked together for years without a cloud , " sarkozy added . in reality , sarkozy had little choice but to reappoint fillon , whose approval ratings far outshine the president ’ s .
a recent poll showed 71 percent of respondents preferring fillon to sarkozy . bildunterschrift : many say sarkozy resents fillon 's popularity other ministers in sarkozy 's favor were allowed to remain in office .
sarkozy said it would have made no sense to replace economics minister christine lagarde and added that , for others , the swap would mark a " new stage . ” " a certain amount of stability helps to soothe a country that is in need , " sarkozy said . a new ‘ campaign team ’ ? sarkozy 's restructuring aims at creating a team more likely to get behind his deficit-cutting austerity agenda and securing support for the upcoming presidential elections in 2012 . but the president denied criticism that his leaner , more conservative cabinet was " a campaign team " ahead of france ’ s 2012 presidential election . " i remain convinced that we must be open , " he said .
" this is not a partisan government ; this is a tightened government . " sarkozy said his reshuffled government would remain in place until the 2012 presidential elections , adding that he had not yet decided whether to throw his hat back in the ring for a second term and would not announce his decision until late 2011 . sarkozy had first signalled in march that he intended to rebuild his cabinet – a plan he confirmed in july . the reshuffle came after months of intrigues and mass street protests against sarkozy 's unpopular extension of the base retirement age from 60 to 62 years . the president ’ s approval rating continues to wane , having hit 35 percent this month .
still , the president remained strongly behind his unpopular pension reform and his controversial expulsion of illegal roma residents , adding that he had no regrets concerning inflammatory remarks he made linking immigration to delinquency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal called the president a ' liar ' harsh criticism opponents on tuesday took advantage of the president 's ever-slipping popularity to criticize sarkozy .
president of the centrist democratic movement party , francois bayrou , slammed sarkozy after the interview for talking too much about himself and too little about the problems facing the french people . " there wasn ’ t a word about education , nor was there a word about the environment , and there was no credible strategy to revive production in france , " bayrou said . socialist former presidential candidate segolene royal also attacked sarkozy after his interview , calling him " a president weakened by his failures " and " discredited by his lies " - the greatest of which , she said , was the claim he had not yet decided to run for reelection . author : david levitz , sarah steffen -lrb- dpa , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the party also wants to introduce stricter rules for foreigners who refuse to integrate . at its annual party conference , german chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- on tuesday voted to ban the screening of embryos used in ivf treatment .
a tight majority of 51 percent of the delegates voted to retain existing policy on pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- .
policy from 2007 allows in vitro fertilization but makes it illegal to check the cells for hereditary diseases .
chancellor merkel had been pushing the ban in the run-up to the convention in karlsruhe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was among those who favor a ban " i favor a pgd ban because i am concerned that we can not define its limits properly , " merkel said on monday .
the issue is of key importance to the party as the cdu has , by definition , to uphold christian values .
according to mainstream christian teaching , life begins at conception .
deep divisions the party is however deeply divided over the issue , and the conference experienced an emotional debate lasting more than three hours .
for many , the memory of the nazis administering lethal injections to handicapped children forbids embryo screening in modern germany .
" if life is a gift from god , it is not given with any condition , " julia kloeckner , leader of cdu in the state of rhineland palatinate said .
" it would be disturbing for doctors to decide which embryos should be allowed to live by saying ' you 're okay , you 're not , " ' she added .
a lesser evil compared to still births and abortions but to delegates in favor of restricted pgd use , pre-screening would be the lesser evil compared to still births and abortions .
" there is a difference between an embryo before and after -lsb- implantation in the womb -rsb- has taken place , " said minister for family affairs kristina schroeder .
other cdu delegates agree .
according to peter hintze , deputy economics minister , it does not make sense that numerous examinations of the fetus inside the womb are allowed , but examinations of the embryo in a petri dish are not .
" pgd would not mean the creation of a designer baby , ” hintze , a protestant theologian , said .
" whoever believes the desire for a blue-eyed baby would lead anyone to undergo ivf , does not meet reality at all . "
jens spahn , cdu 's expert on health matters , did not believe that pre-screening techniques will be limited to serious diseases only .
legislation expected in july , the federal court of justice ruled that pgd is currently exempt from punishment .
in the coming weeks , the german parliament , the bundestag , will decide whether pgd should be banned by law .
tuesday ’ s decision might dissuade some cdu delegates from voting against the ban .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger demanded a debate on pgd justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a member of the cdu 's coalition partner the fdp , criticized the decision and said a debate was needed in order to define strict guidelines for the use of pgd .
many of her party colleagues demand a limited usage of the technique .
other european nations such as britain , france , belgium and denmark already permit the screening .
integration policy the cdu also decided on stricter rules for foreigners who are not willing to integrate .
chancellor merkel recently declared multiculturalism to have failed and the conference agreed to pursue an integration policy that was in the " interests of germany " and an end to the " politics of misunderstood tolerance . "
" those rules are actually quite simple .
whoever wants to live here has to learn german .
whoever lives here has to respect our laws and values , " merkel said .
" those who do not follow the rules can expect to face sanctions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 16.11.2010 eu steps up the pressure on irish banks , opens talks with imf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks in ireland could use a few more irish euro coins for the first time , the european commission has hinted at a possible economic rescue for ireland .
the eu 's economy commissioner said the bloc was in talks with the imf on tackling problems in the irish banking sector . the european union on tuesday announced it is in talks with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- about taking on growing problems in ireland 's banking sector .
eu economy commissioner olli rehn said ahead of a meeting with eurozone finance ministers in brussels that ireland 's banking crisis was " the most pressing problem " facing the monetary union . meanwhile , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , who headed tuesday 's talks by the panel of financial ministers known as the eurogroup , vowed to protect the 16-nation euro currency . juncker urged that the irish government would have to decide on financial aid , with inevitable strings attached , within days .
however , he stressed that no aid could be given if ireland did not request it . " the discussions that will take place between ireland and the -lsb- european -rsb- commission and the ecb and the imf will enable us to have at our disposal all the elements and instruments we need were ireland to make a request for assistance to the eu , the imf and the europgroup , " juncker told reporters . euro ' not threatened ' solvency concerns have grown in ireland after a 45 billion euro -lrb- $ 61 billion -rrb- bailout for private banks increased its deficit in 2010 to 32 percent of gross domestic product .
however , rehn also pointed out that the crisis in ireland was limited to its banking sector , and that the government was " funded well until the middle of next year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rehn says ireland 's banking crisis is the eurozone 's biggest problem rehn cautioned against alarmism , saying the irish debt crisis was " not a matter of survival for the euro . "
german chancellor angela merkel repeated this assurance tuesday evening , telling ard public television she did not believe the eurozone to be in danger , but that the bloc was " experiencing turmoil and situations of the kind i would n't have dreamed of a year and a half ago , " merkel added .
rumor mill irish prime minister brian cowen meanwhile sought to dispel rumors in an address to parliament tuesday that ireland had already applied for an additional bailout for its banks .
" we have not applied to any facility .
despite the fact that it was being mentioned in a lot of so-called reputable news organizations does not make it any truer , " cowen said . he said ireland was discussing with the eu about ways to normalize market conditions and was attempting to ensure that any decisions were also in the interest of stabilizing the eurozone . a financial crisis in greece that similarly threatened the euro forced it to accept a rescue package on a larger scale earlier this year , which came with many conditions from the eu and imf . waiting on ireland bildunterschrift : ireland 's banking problems are seen as a euro threat ireland 's reluctance to accept a rescue package may be to avoid similar conditions in an effort to solve its banking crisis on its own .
however , newspaper reports in the country suggested ireland was moving closer to a bailout as the eu piled on the pressure .
" to fend off being forced into a bailout for the entire state , finance minister brian lenihan is poised to agree to a bank injection to stabilize the euro and calm markets , " the irish independent reported , citing an unnamed source .
ca n't ' throw money from helicopters ' meanwhile in a visit to rome , germany 's economy minister rainer bruederle said " throwing money from helicopters " was not a solution to fixing economic problems .
the economic phrase refers to a practice where a government simply creates money until the economy gets going again .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle says money should n't be ' thrown from helicopters ' bruederle said countries like ireland or greece should implement reforms to reduce deficits in order to eliminate the need for future bailouts .
" the european community as a whole has an interest in finding a way to have guarantees of a solution when there are difficulties , " he said .
meanwhile , the ecb is currently channeling about a quarter of its loans into irish banks , and ireland has put the figure required to save its financial institutions at around 50 billion euros .

and some are wondering if the social network 's privacy policies are strong enough . at a press conference in san francisco , california on monday , facebook ceo mark zuckerberg unveiled the latest of the social networking platform ’ s innovations , facebook messages .
with this announcement , facebook , which counts more than 500 million users , is pushing into google 's turf with this e-mail-like service .
although zuckerberg would be quick to say messages is not e-mail , facebook users will have an @ facebook.com address once the system is released , so it definitely looks similar .
one of the features of messages highlighted in the press conference is its archival function , basically storing all records of messages sent between parties .
given some of facebook 's history with privacy issues , this feature could create some discomfort for less public users .
a digital shoebox facebook 's messaging system has always been integral to the platform , providing users with a slightly less public forum for discussion than publishing everything on " facebook walls , " the bulletin boards that display the activities of a user .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : facebook 's latest plans have created a media stir with messages , zuckerberg says the concept is to " flatten " the landscape of communication .
teens , he said at the press conference , prefer sms over e-mail because the latter is too slow , whereas others strictly use e-mail or instant messaging to talk to their friends and family .
so facebook intends to use messages to aggregate these three different means of communication into one conversation .
one user may send an sms , another might reply with an e-mail , but both messages appear on facebook as part of a conversation .
the result , facebook says , will be a continuous collection of conversation history between friends .
the image used in promotional material by facebook is that messages will be analogous to the boxes of letters people once used to collect and cherish , as a way to remember the course of a relationship .
but what about privacy ?
as the new system is gradually rolled out , users will be able to send and receive e-mails with their new @ facebook.com e-mail address .
at first , facebook users will only receive mail from their facebook friends , with all other mail going into an other or a junk mail folder .
but users may " promote " mail from these folders to their primary folders if they wish .
the conversation history will be stored on facebook , which could raise security concerns for some .
when asked about an option for " off the record " conversations at the press conference , zuckerberg responded that users would have the option to delete threads or messages , but that " off the record " does n't make sense .
in the past , facebook has weathered criticism for some of the wording in their terms of use , which in february 2009 , briefly seemed to state that facebook would own any content a user uploaded to the public site , in perpetuity .
facebook and zuckerberg quickly moved to douse the flames of public outcry and released a new terms of use with the section on privacy right up at the top which states , " you own all of the content and information you post on facebook , and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings .

but of course , phishers and scam artists see that sort of openness and the plethora of personal information as an all-you-can-eat buffet and facebook can be dangerous waters for the uninitiated in internet security .

most people 's e-mail clients are clogged with old conversations , but mashable thinks that having a written record of all communication in proximity to the host of potentially personal information within facebook , could make for a dangerous mixture .

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .
what specifically do you need to be able to better help people in haiti ?
improving children 's lives has got to be priority .
at the moment the majority of children do not complete 12 years of schooling .
the majority of schools in haiti are private .
only about 50 percent of children attend primary education and under 85 percent of them finish .
haiti needs support to develop a strong public education system – that means access but also good quality teaching staff .
in some parts of the country there are teachers who have not been paid in months .
there is a similar problem with the health system .
the majority of services are private .
we need major investment in creating widespread public health services and really well trained health practitioners who are encouraged to stay in the country .
finally , we need livelihood development in rural areas particularly so that people are not drawn into cities .
and we need infrastructure to support livelihood development – that is to say , services in rural areas .
port au prince 's infrastructure was designed for about 400,000 people .
the current estimate is that about four million people are living here .
people are drawn to the capital for employment .
the government needs a long term strategy to help create opportunities for employment and creation of livelihoods , especially in rural areas .

deutsche welle talked to one of them about the fight to contain the deadly disease . world vision is one of the many aid organizations trying to stem the spread of cholera , which has claimed more than 900 lives and infected some 15,000 people in haiti .
deutsche welle interviewed world vision spokesperson michelle rice on the ground in haiti via email about what is being done and what further help the impoverished island nation needs .
deutsche welle : how much of a connection is there between the earthquake in january and the current cholera outbreak ?
michelle rice : there is no causal relationship between the earthquake on january 12 and the cholera outbreak .
the majority of people affected by the outbreak have been from artibonite / central plateau , which is about 60 miles away from port au prince – the area directly affected by the earthquake .
the current thinking , although not conclusive , is that the cause of the outbreak was contamination of the artibonite river – after recent heavy rains and flooding .
what problems do you encounter as an aid organization in terms of governmental structures ?
government ministries have been affected by the earthquake .
government buildings were destroyed and many lives were lost .
even before the earthquake the public sector was strained and in great need of support and strengthening .
one of the roles of the aid sector is to work alongside government ministries to help build capacity .
this happens across all levels from the local level up to the departments .
despite the need for major capacity building , the government has shown leadership with the un working with international agencies responding to the cholera outbreak .
collaboration has been a focus , not just for the cholera outbreak , but also for the earthquake response .
with cholera , rapid action is critical to prevent the spread .
containment – through widespread hygiene promotion and treatments – has to be done cooperatively because it 's a huge job to reach out to all of haiti .
then there 's the means to respond .
handwashing is simple enough but it does n't work without clean water and soap .
the majority of haitians have limited access to clean water and good sanitation .
collaboration with the government has been a critical part of containment and prevention .
the german newspaper die zeit recently ran a headline : “ cholera reveals the weakness of aid organizations . “ how true is that statement ?
cholera was always a fear after the earthquake left 1.5 million people displaced and living in camps .
but it 's been ten months since the earthquake and this is the first occurrence of cholera .
it 's also surfaced in a rural area along a river away from the earthquake epicenter - where most agencies are working .
but given the pressure already on agencies – their response to the outbreak so far shows strong coordination .
despite already having a big job with the earthquake aftermath , agencies have coordinated , mobilized and re-oriented their resources to contain the outbreak .
agencies are reaching out beyond their own program areas to ensure broad coverage of hygiene promotion .
for example along the border region response activities are being coordinated between several agencies .
but the outbreak also underlines a much bigger issue for haiti : infrastructure development .
that means access to water and sanitation infrastructure , and water source and waste management .
the majority of haitians do n't have access to clean water .
in rural areas 51 percent of people have access to improved water and only 12 per cent have access to improved sanitation .
we need to support the development of comprehensive infrastructure for water and waste management .

there is a similar problem with the health system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 16.11.2010 solar energy , regional politics dominate discussion between germany and morocco großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moroccan capital rabat is the site of bilateral german-moroccan talks german foreign minister guido westerwelle is spending the early part of this week in morocco .
he wants to talk about energy , but his hosts have put a different issue on the agenda . the western sahara is an important region for a variety of reasons .
the prevalence of sun makes it an ideal location for solar energy facilities , and the area is rich in phosphate .
the disputed territory is also the subject of a tug-of-war between morocco and the algerian backed sahrawi arab democratic republic -lrb- sadr -rrb- , which wants it to become an independent state .
when german foreign minister guido westerwelle arrived in the moroccan capital on monday for the first day of a three-day visit , he was confronted with the issue .
he chose his words with care .
“ the main thing is that everyone involved places their faith in negotiations and dialogue , ” westerwelle said .
“ what we want to communicate to our partners is the message of non-violence . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is having to tread lightly moroccan foreign minister taieb fassi fihri interpreted that statement as an expression of support for his government 's position vis-a-vis the sahrawi national liberation movement polisario and its algerian backers .
“ you have heard the german foreign minister , who said appeals to violence , such as those unfortunately issued by polisario and algeria , will not lead to a solution , ” fihri said .
“ we greatly value the statement that negotiations are the most important thing . ”
but it is unclear whether dialogue will be sufficient to resolve a conflict that has existed for decades .
fence sitting bildunterschrift : morocco and algeria both have interests in the region the western sahara was part of spain 's african colonies from the late nineteenth-century until 1975 , when the spanish withdrew , and both morocco and mauritania tried to annex the territory .
that drew resistance from polisario , the nationalist movement for the sahrawi , an arab-berber ethnic group of over 250,000 people , who claim to be the original inhabitants of the region .
by 1979 a campaign of violent resistance by polisario , with the backing of algeria , had forced mauritania from the western sahara .
morocco , however , expanded its control , and in 1991 , a un peace-keeping mission succeeded in establishing a ceasefire .
the un has recognized sadr as a representative of western saharans , and a referendum was planned to let them decide between independence or remaining part of morocco with increased autonomy .
that referendum has been stalled , though , for the past two decades .
bildunterschrift : the future of the sahrawi is up in the air morocco voted for germany to be given a two-year seat on the united nations security council .
now rabat would like a political favor in return .
“ we consulted with germany before we presented our autonomy plan , a plan of compromise that fulfills the criteria of the un security council , ” fihri said .
but polisario and algeria would like to see an independent western saharan state , and westerwelle was careful not to throw clear support in one direction or the other .
“ we are not taking sides in this question , ” westerwelle said .
“ we 're a conversation partner , and above all , we place our faith in the mediating role of the united nations . ”
indeed , in morocco , westerwelle is more interested in talking economics than politics .
here comes the sun morocco is one of the few countries in the arab world that does n't produce oil , and rabat is investing heavily in solar energy .
that represents a convergence of influence with germany , which has enormous technical expertise in that area .
bildunterschrift : solar energy is becoming more important in the middle east so westerwelle 's visit is also an opportunity to drum up some business in a country that has traditionally been oriented more toward spain and france .
“ we germans have top technology , and i 'm thinking especially of solar-energy technology , ” westerwelle said .
“ and in cooperation with morocco , we can use this solar technology particularly well .
that also represents a major chance for german companies to do business . ”
underscoring the tight connection between economics , energy and politics is the fact that the head of morocco 's one power utility , ali fassi fihri , is the moroccan foreign minister 's brother .
morocco is currently engaged in a massive solar-energy project that will cost $ 9 billion -lrb- 6.6 billion euros -rrb- and hopefully provide 38 percent of the country 's energy needs by the year 2020 .
on its own , germany has invested 43 million euros in solar energy in morocco , and the european union has pumped many millions more into the project .
as westerwelle is experiencing first-hand , involvement in moroccan politics is tricky business .
but the rewards are potentially very great .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany may send nuclear waste to russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear waste disposal is a divisive issue in germany germany is seeking to export 951 spent nuclear fuel rods , currently held at a temporary storage facility in the country 's west , to russia – but critics have called the plans dangerous and irresponsible . it may not be a universally popular move , but exporting nuclear waste is permitted under german law – on the condition that the destination country disposes the waste safely .
in fact , germany has sent shipments of nuclear waste to russia several times in the past .
up until 2009 , one firm regularly exported uranium hexafluoride , or uf6 , from a fuel rod treatment facility in gronau .
uf6 is a by-product created when uranium is enriched , and in order to avoid legal difficulties associated with disposing radioactive waste , the company rebranded its by-product as a resource to be sent to russia for processing .
the deliveries were stopped in 2009 , partly as a result of fierce protests .
now , the export of german nuclear waste to russia is back on the cards , as the german government considers an application to export 951 spent fuel rods to russia for disposal .
according to critics , however , the stakes may be higher this time around .
" we 're dealing with something different , " said tobias muenchmeyer of greenpeace germany .
greater fallout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russian processing facility , mayak , was the site of one of the largest ever nuclear explosions muenchmeyer said that unlike uf6 , which is associated with low radiation levels , " we 're dealing with the spent nuclear fuel from a research reactor in germany , which , like all nuclear waste , also contains plutonium and other fission products and therefore represents incredibly dangerous cargo . "
the fuel rods , from a former east german research reactor near dresden , were originally imported from the soviet union in 1957 and were used until 1991 .
research reactors often use highly enriched material compared to most nuclear power plants – including material that can be used to make atom bombs .
russia and the united states have agreed to take back such waste in order to limit the spread of weapons-grade material and the german state of saxony , which owns the rods , is relying on that agreement to wash its hands of the matter .
because there is no interim storage facility in saxony , the fuel rods were moved in 2005 to ahaus in the state of north rhine-westphalia and saxony has been paying rent for their storage ever since .
" our position is clear , " a spokesperson for saxony 's science ministry said recently , " as long as international conditions are satisfied , then we want to see the material put back where it belongs . "
passing the rod as far as saxony is concerned , ' where it belongs ' is in a russian nuclear facility at mayak , some 150 km south-east of ekaterinburg .
for the opposition greens , though , mayak is anything but a safe repository .
" we know that mayak is highly contaminated , " said sylvia kotting-uhl , greens spokesperson for nuclear policy .
" we also know that mayak is not operated with anything like the same philosophy of safety that is considered standard here in germany .
so to move the waste fuel rods there is incredibly negligent . "
mayak – or ' lighthouse ' – is one of the oldest nuclear research centers of the former soviet union , and was also home , in 1957 , to one of the largest-ever nuclear tests .
some experts consider mayak 's environment to be more polluted than that of chernobyl , the site of the soviet union 's worst nuclear accident .
germany 's environment ministry , which confirmed that it had received an application to export the waste after press reports first uncovered the story last week , is responsible for determining whether such an export would be legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent transport of nuclear waste to gorleben , in northern germany , sparked mass protests setting a precedent an environment ministry spokesperson said that it would " only make a decision after careful consideration of questions over the safety of the russian site mayak . "
if the experts decide that mayak is safe , little will stand between the waste and its final repository .
the environment ministry has confirmed that a delivery contract has already been drawn up between germany and russia , ready to be signed .
this has left anti-nuclear groups and the opposition concerned , and only in part because they believe the 349 kilograms of plutonium will not be stored safely if they do make their way to mayak .
some fear the export could create a precedent , and encourage nations like russia to trade nuclear waste for cash .
greenpeace 's thomas muenchmeyer says that russians have extended such offers to accept waste in the past , but that " few of those have been official so far . "
he says south korea and taiwan are also potentially interested in such trades , but these are " still – thankfully - completely taboo in europe . "
the european union 's energy chief , guenther oettinger , recently announced plans to introduce a europe-wide ban on the export of nuclear waste .
the announcement was welcomed cautiously by anti-nuclear campaigners , who are concerned that it could contain loopholes when it comes to the export of ' resources ' like uf6 .

one of these writers is chinese nobel prize-winner liu xiaobo , currently incarcerated in china as a political prisoner . chosen as the winner of this year 's hermann kesten medal - a prize awarded annually by pen for outstanding efforts in support of persecuted authors - liu was eagerly awaited by a group of guests at the ceremony in the german city of darmstadt last week , but neither he nor his wife could attend , said the president of the german branch of pen , johano strasser . behind bars at this time , liu is serving time at a jail 450 kilometers north of beijing .
on december 25 , 2009 , he was sentenced to 11 years ' imprisonment on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power . liu was one of the creators of charter 08 - a manifesto initially signed in 2008 by over 350 chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in china .
the document currently has around 10,000 signatures and demands rights such as freedom of speech , freedom of assembly and the right to form political parties . tilman spengler , one of the ceremony 's hosts , pointed out that these demands are in full accordance with the chinese constitution , which , at least in theory , guarantees human rights . bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is passionate about advancing democracy and human rights in china theory and reality in china , those who , like liu , actively support human rights , are carefully scrutinized by the authorities .
since the nobel committee announced him as the winner of the peace prize in october , pressure on those who do n't follow the government line in china has increased .
numerous dissidents , including liu 's wife , are under house arrest , have faced interrogations or have been preemptively detained . the chinese government has been doing all it can to keep its citizens away from the nobel peace prize ceremony , which is due to be held on december 10 in oslo .
just recently , china 's authorities prevented liu 's lawyer mo shaoping from leaving the country on allegations of endangering national security .
according to geir lundestad , director of the norwegian nobel institute , it is likely that neither the diploma nor the medal can be awarded , since neither liu nor anyone associated with him will be allowed to attend .

she was a logical choice for this role , as the two of them are friends and liu himself is a former president of pen in china . in her emotional acceptance speech , martin-liao described liu 's reaction to the news from the nobel committee .
according to her , the first sentence that the tearful liu uttered was , " this prize is for the victims of the 4th of june 1989 . " for liu , the chinese democratic movement and its brutal end at the tiananmen square massacre was a turning point .
he repeatedly said that he , as a survivor , felt a duty to fight for justice on behalf of those who had been killed in the incident . a mission this sense of duty led to liu 's imprisonment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 16.11.2010 french senate passes new e-book law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed law would affect books sold for the kindle , ipad the bill , which is expected to pass the national assembly later this month , would let publishers set e-book prices .
the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

the delay could severely threaten the fledgling european diplomatic service , which is due to begin work on january 1 . the european union has failed to agree on a budget for 2011 , missing a self-imposed deadline of midnight on monday .
the deadlock centered on disagreements between the european parliament and representatives of the 27 member states ' national governments .
the breakdown came despite an existing consensus on the actual budget numbers .
last week , the european parliament bowed to pressure from national governments by agreeing to increase next year 's budget by only 2.9 percent , less than half of the increase that it had asked for .
but member states balked at parliament 's call for more power in shaping of budget over the next decade .
european parliament president jerzy buzek called the failure to agree on a new budget " bad news . "
new projects threaten funding difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be forced to operate next year using 2010 figures buzek indicated that " some member states " were to blame for the breakdown - particularly the united kingdom , sweden and the netherlands .
eu diplomats , however , said the parliament had made demands that had nothing to do with the new budget . the delay severely threatens planned institutions , including the european external action service -lrb- ead -rrb- , a new diplomatic service due to begin work at the start of next year , and the iter experimental nuclear reactor in southern france " this is an unfortunate failure , " said the chairman of the budget committee , alain lamassoure .
" but there are still a few weeks until the end of the year . "
the lawmakers are due to continue their talks on the 2011 budget and the future financing of the eu at next month 's summit , scheduled for december 16-17 . if a deal still can not be reached , the eu will be forced to operate using the 2010 budget on a monthly basis . the eu 's budget commissioner , janusz lewandowski , warned the warring sides not to gloss over the implications failing to reach consensus " i do n't want to be overdramatic ... but do not underestimate all the problems , " lewandowski said , adding that burden for subsidies due to be paid in january would fall to the member states . author : sarah harman -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ireland has sunk to weakest-link status , but dublin is still refusing to request a bailout . eurozone finance ministers are gathering in brussels on tuesday to search for solutions to ireland 's and portugal 's debt crises , with the two countries facing mounting pressure to make formal requests for bailouts .
ireland 's coalition government has held off on asking for a bailout that many are calling inevitable .
it was faced with 130 billion euros -lrb- $ 177 billion -rrb- in outstanding european central bank loans last month - as well as a deficit set to hit 32 percent of gross domestic product this year .
no request yet ireland admitted on monday that it was holding talks with the european union - under pressure from germany and the european central bank - about the possibility of an emergency aid package .
yet , while some sources said figures from 45 to 90 billion euros were being discussed , both irish and eu officials stressed that no bailout request had yet been made .
" ireland is making no application for the funding of the state because clearly we are pre-funded right up to the middle of next year , " prime minister brian cowen told ireland 's rte public radio . meanwhile , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who is also the president of the eurogroup of finance ministers , said that the eurozone was ready to act " as soon as possible " if ireland sought financial assistance . but he stressed that " ireland has not put forward their request , " and added , " as long as they do n't , we are not supposed to deal with a theoretical request . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cowen says ireland will be just fine for another year under pressure ewald nowotny , a member of the european central bank 's governing council , said the european union wanted a " quick , good solution to ireland , so that there would be no spill-over " to other heavily indebted countries such as portugal and spain .
ireland has come under pressure from eurozone leaders , who fear the country 's debt crisis could bring down the rest of the bloc .
debt is widespread in the eurozone and the eu , but ireland is currently seen as the weakest link .
portugal also in trouble meanwhile , portugal , which is already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , admitted on monday it was in difficulty , but portuguese finance minister fernando teixeira dos santos said there were no plans as of yet for lisbon to request emergency funding .
at their monthly meeting in brussels , the eurozone finance ministers are also expected to discuss the future eurozone crisis resolution mechanism , which germany wants to start from 2013 , replacing the 440-billion-euro european financial stability facility set up after greece sought help in may .
the ministers are also expected to praise ireland 's 2011 budget cuts , which face a parliamentary vote of approval next month .
meanwhile , in ireland , finance minister brian lenihan is expected to release details of a new four-year debt-cutting program before the end of the month .

he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .

but attention has fallen on one man who is n't present : prosecutors claim links to the chechen president . the trial of three chechens charged with complicity in the murder of a dissident began in austria on tuesday , in a case that has implicated the chechen president ramzan kadyrov .
state prosecutors in vienna are seeking to establish ties between kadyrov and the killing of umar israilov , as three men go on trial for in the chechen dissident 's murder .
israilov , the chechen president 's former bodyguard turned critic , was gunned down on january 13 , 2009 , near his home in vienna .
investigators say one of the accused planned the killing , while another followed the victim and the third drove the car carrying the shooter .
the gunman is believed to have fled austria .
the case has received considerable attention from human rights activists , who have pointed fingers at kadyrov from the beginning .
on monday , austrian parliamentarian peter pilz accused kadyrov of maintaining several secret agents in austria to intimidate critics of his pro-kremlin regime .
the green party lawmaker told reporters that austria 's counter-intelligence service " knows about 30 terrorists on kadyrov 's payroll in austria . "
" their mission is to intimidate members of the opposition , threaten them and in some cases attack , kidnap and murder , like in the case of israilov , " pilz alleged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadyrov is known for his close ties to moscow implications could reach moscow the trial could have far-reaching political implications if prosecutors succeed in drawing a link to kadyrov , according to austrian human rights lawyer manfred nowak .
" of course -lsb- kadyrov -rsb- has a good connection to the leadership in moscow , " nowak said , adding that if “ kadyrov himself is involved in severe crimes and human rights abuses , then that could lead to a liability for russian foreign policy . "
austrian police have said in a report that there were clear links between israilov 's murder and president kadyrov , but nowak doubted charges would be brought against the chechen president .
" to bring a criminal charge one has to have really strong evidence ; clues are not sufficient , " the former un special rapporteur on torture said .
police failed to save israilov israilov 's murder has been a great embarrassment to the vienna police , whom the victim repeatedly told he was being pursued and asked for protection .
nadja lorenz , the lawyer representing israilov 's family , said police should have done more .
" the end of this tragic story was that a number of emails were sent -lsb- to police -rsb- which named one of those who is now on trial , " she said .
" the last email which was sent -lsb- by police -rsb- told israilov to call the emergency number if needed … seven days later he was murdered . "
a witness silenced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israilov was a witness before the european court for human rights israilov filed charges against kadyrov after fleeing the chechen republic in 2006 , claiming to have witnessed killings and tortures conducted by kadyrov and his paramilitary forces .
he and his father became key witnesses in a case against the russian and chechen governments at the european court of human rights , alleging the chechen regime had implemented systematic torture and other human rights abuses .
the case was eventually dropped after israilov and his father disappeared into hiding and could n't be reached for further questioning .
israilov 's widow is reported to be living in austria with her four children .
his father , who is said to have fled europe in fear of his life , was expected to return to vienna for the court hearing under heavy security presence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disarmament -pipe- 16.11.2010 white house pushes for start , but ratification remains uncertain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the start treaty would cut us and russian nuclear arsenals with ratification of the new start treaty only likely to be more difficult when the next congress takes office in 2011 , the white house is pushing for a vote in the lame-duck senate .
but success is all but sure . on sunday , us president barack obama and his cabinet launched a coordinated public relations blitz aimed at rallying support for the ratification of the nuclear disarmament pact washington had negotiated with moscow .
following a meeting with russian president dmitry medvedev on the sidelines of the apec economic summit in seoul , obama promised to get the us-russian nuclear arms reduction deal passed before the new congress takes office next year .
" i reiterated my commitment to get the start treaty done during the lame duck session , and i 've communicated to congress that it is a top priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original treaty was signed by george bush and mikhail gorbachev in 1991 one day later , on monday , us secretary of state , hillary clinton , and defense secretary robert gates followed up with a op-ed article in the washington post , urging congress to quickly ratify the so-called new start treaty - the successor of the original start initiated by president ronald reagan , which expired at the end of last year .
under the headline " we ca n't delay this treaty , " clinton and gates made the case for congress to pass the treaty , arguing that " our national security depends on it . " high stakes the full-court press by the obama administration highlights both the importance and the stakes for ratification of new start that would limit american and russian strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 respectively , and improve the verification regime .
but analysts are skeptical as to whether the joint appeal by obama , clinton and gates will be enough to persuade republicans to vote for the new start pact .
some republican lawmakers believe the treaty weakens the us , while others feel strongly that the newly elected senate should be given a chance to vote on the pact .
still others are loathe to give obama a victory in his lame-duck session , and are looking to renegotiate the treaty entirely . ratification requires a two-third majority , or 67 votes in the us senate .
democrats can command 59 votes in the current senate ; in the next senate they will only control 53 votes .
" i think it is doubtful that this extremely important step will be taken by the united states , " said karl kaiser , director of the program on transatlantic relations at harvard university .
" the atmosphere of hostility and partisanship in the united states is such that the vote that the senate foreign relations committee took - where a majority actually voted in favor of the treaty - i do not think can be repeated .
even in a lame-duck session , ” kaiser told deutsche welle .
while some senior republican foreign-policy experts , such as richard lugar , support start and want to help get it passed , others want to renegotiate the deal or think a vote should be taken by the new congress .
political football ?
the treaty is a solid , if not overly ambitious agreement , and it should be ratified since it would increase us national security , argues patricia lewis , deputy director of the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratification will only become tougher when the new senate is sworn in " if it gets turned into political football between two parties in the country and has nothing to do with the larger and wider security issues then who is to know what will happen , " lewis told deutsche welle .
she added : " i really hope that it does get ratified and as soon as possible .
because right now there are no inspections on strategic weapons .
we want to move ahead with better and more wide-ranging cuts with the russians , and doing that if this is n't ratified would be very difficult . "
in light of its experience with the comprehensive test ban treaty , which moscow ratified and the us did n't , russia said this time around that it would only ratify new start after washington had done so .
therefore , according to kaiser , " a setback would also be very bad for the long-term goal of getting rid of all nuclear weapons and non-proliferation . "
and lewis said that if the us does n't ratify the treaty , " the trust in the united states as a negotiating partner , as a partner with whom you can do business , as a partner who can give their word and keep their word ... becomes further diminished .
that would be a real pity . "
europe 's role lewis and kaiser have different opinions as to how much influence europe and the rest of the world can have on the ratification of the treaty .
" i think the entire world will disagree if the treaty does n't get ratified because this is literally what everybody has wanted , " argues kaiser , who believes europe has n't done enough to support the ratification of the deal .
" it is not enough to simply agree with the vision of a non-nuclear world .
that 's very popular in europe .
nor is it enough to just argue you have to get rid of tactical nuclear weapons , as a number of europeans countries have done , " kaiser said .
according to kaiser , europe needs to give signals to the americans " at the highest political levels , notably the senate , " that the world expects american leadership in this matter .
but for her part , lewis is n't sure how useful it is to put more international pressure on the us .
" the united states is a democracy .
and this is very much a debate within the united states democracy , " she said . " it 's a debate for the senate to have .
i think there is a limit to which other countries can have a huge impact on domestic debates . "

the idea is to prevent publishers from being undercut by the likes of amazon or apple . the french senate has passed the first reading of a bill that would allow publishers to set a fixed price on e-books , in a bid to try to protect publishers and smaller retailers as the e-book market takes off .
but since the first reading on october 26 , several objections have been raised - not least of which are whether the law is even legal .
an extension of a 30-year-old law the law proposed by centre-right senators catherine dumas and jacques legendre aims to replicate the 1981 lang law , which prohibits the sale of physical books for less than five per cent below a cover price set by the publisher .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bill passed the french senate on october 26 , and is expected to be taken up by the national assembly later this month this law has proved popular in france , helping to maintain one of europe 's best networks independent bookstores by protecting them from competition from large chains .
dumas and legendre 's bill was the result of a year of consultations with writers , publishers and retailers , who are concerned that their revenues will be hit by the expanding online market .
but for now , industry figures show that e-books make up less than one per cent of france 's book market , but that is expected to double in the next year .
" in 2011 , we will see the beginning of a really strong market , " said clément hering , an analyst with gfk , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" till now , it 's been quite a tiny market because of the price of products , which is quite high in france , and the number of platforms that are selling e-books which is quite tiny too , but that is changing . "
according to hering , the e-book market so far has been a way of generating extra revenue for publishers rather than something that erodes profits , but that could change .
in the us , digital literature accounts for more than eight per cent of the book market .
enforcability remains an issue but as the internet is international , it is difficult to see how this law will work in practice .
there seems little to stop a french consumer buying a book from a website based in another country , unless the government decides to geo-block e-book retailer websites .
otherwise , a french consumer could just as easily buy the same title at a lower price from belgium or luxembourg .
another more serious obstacle is the european court of justice - this protectionist measure might turn out to run contrary to the idea of a single european market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european court of justice in luxembourg may have to face legal challenges to this law , if it passes the court has dealt with similar cases , including ones resulting from the lang law , by determining whether the rule would be discriminatory against imports .
" if they would be discriminatory then , prima facie , they would be unlawful unless the state imposing the restriction would be able justify it in some way . " said angus johnston , an eu law specialist at oxford university .
the protection of national culture can be adduced as a justification , but johnston says it is difficult to argue that a country 's literary heritage is protected by allowing the country itself rather than the importer to set the price of a book .
" on the face of it seems it would be challengeable successfully under eu free trade law , " he added .
slowing innovation the french parliament will take up the debate again in the next few weeks , when an amended version of the bill will be brought before both houses a final time before it can be signed into law .
another problem with the proposed law , industry watchers said , is that it may inhibit innovation in this relatively new marketplace .
the bill does n't make a distinction between books that are distributed under creative commons and other kinds of open , free intellectual property licenses .
this , on the face of it , seems simple : just set the price at zero and carry on distributing the works for free .
but sébastien hache , the director of sesamath a publishing house that creates online text books , wants to be able to keep his options open .
" if a price is stipulated , we are worried people will be prevented from selling it in developing countries , for example , or elsewhere , " he said .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

but the balance is threatened by climate change and human activities . located east of the african continent in the indian ocean , madagascar is home to thousands of species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else on earth .
the island separated from mainland africa between 100 million and 200 million years ago , creating a time-capsule of life in the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slash and burn agriculture is widespread in madagascar today the island provides a sanctuary for plants and animals that have long since disappeared from other parts of the world .
according to the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , madagascar is home to 5 percent of the world 's plant and animal species , and of these , more than 80 percent are endemic to the island .
they include the lemur infraorder of primates .
ecological treasure trove today , there are nearly 100 species of lemurs on madagascar , 30 of which are categorized as endangered or facing extinction .
to locals , these creatures have a spiritual significance and are often referred to as " forest spirits . "
many malagasy people even believe that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors .
almost all the island 's snakes , frogs , chameleons and geckos are also endemic .
the island 's ecological treasure trove includes 250 bird species and 3,000 butterfly types , while some 80 percent of the 12,000 plant species found here are endemic , as are six of the eight species of baobab tree found in the world .
moreover , scientists suspect that madagascar 's rainforests also contain a range of rare and previously undiscovered species .
the deforestation disaster some 20 million people live on madagascar , and the population is growing by half a million a year , the majority of whom are farmers .
now , small-scale but widespread clearance of vegetation - primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and for firewood and charcoal production - is causing forest destruction and degradation .
more than 90 percent of madagascar 's original forests have already disappeared , and the country continues to lose an estimated 120,000 hectares annually to deforestation .
according to the wwf , madagascar will , at this rate , have lost its forests completely within the next 40 years - and with them , the natural habitats of its extraordinary flora and fauna .
" if we fail to save the forests , we will lose countless species we still do n't even know much about , " said dorothea august , an expert on madagascar at the wwf .
" the discovery of a new species of giant mouse lemur this spring illustrates how unexplored and mysterious madagascar 's forests still are . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : baobab trees are often called the ' upside down tree ' due to their unique shape " if this destruction continues unchecked , then the days are numbered for many flora and fauna , " august stressed .
in addition to this loss of unique biodiversity , forest degradation is also leading to massive land erosion .
the consequences are landslides and floods , while widespread gully erosion also produces heavily silted rivers that then run red .
political turmoil as an environmental threat the malagasy government is waking up to the importance of environmental protection , and is collaborating with the wwf on a project that promotes sustainable use of water resources in the mahafaly plateau .
so far , 35,000 people in 13 villages have benefited from the program .
but other initiatives have proved less constructive , not least because of the country 's ongoing political turmoil .
" the country lurches from one government crisis to the next , " said daniela freyer , a biologist at the german ngo pro wildlife .
" partners are unreliable , " she added , explaining that monitoring systems therefore tend to break down , and corrupt practices mean the island 's wildlife continues to die out .
" exports of protected tropical wood to countries like germany and china are actually approved by the authorities , " she said - adding that that happens usually thanks to " special authorizations " given by officials . communique to government urges action equally tolerated - albeit unofficially - is the illegal wildlife trade , which sees animals such as geckos and mantella frogs captured and sold as food , pets , leather , tourist curios , and medicine .
dorothea august from the wwf agrees that political mistakes and passivity pose a serious obstacle .
" when it comes to achieving environmental goals , this does n't help , " she stated .
in march 2009 , a dozen environmental ngos submitted a communique to madagascar 's government urging it to take steps to curb the destruction of its natural habitats .
" but nothing has happened , " she said .
international ngos can nonetheless point to a number of successful cooperations with authorities at local nature reserves .
and as pro wildlife 's freyer observes , these are highly constructive partnerships .
it 's important for environmental organizations to be active on site , picking up the slack for the failure of any official input .
" it means at least a minimum of protection takes place , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 16.11.2010 germany coach loew taps young dortmund talent for sweden friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some young players in yellow are ready to take center stage the mercurial rise of youthful dortmund in the bundesliga has not gone unnoticed .
for wednesday 's match , germany 's coach has called up a quartet of dortmunders .
some may being staying in the national squad . on the one hand , it 's a mark of how confident joachim loew is that he 's omitted regulars like mesut oezil , thomas mueller and philipp lahm for the sweden match in goeteborg mid-week .
but a bit of additional quality in the squad is never unwelcome .
in the past , loew has called up young players as a reward for good performances in the domestic league - and as a way of securing their services for germany in future .
wednesday 's squad includes two debutees from dortmund , marcel schmelzer and mario goetze .
in addition , two of their teammates , mats hummels and kevin grosskreutz , are being capped for only the second time .
not every player who gets a call-up goes on to play a meaningful role in the national squad , of course , but each of these players have reason to hope wednesday wo n't be the last time they 'll be donning a germany jersey .
so who are these young players and what are their strengths and future prospects for germany ?
mats hummels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hummels is the bundesliga 's top-rated defender a product of bayern munich 's youth academy , 21-year-old mats hummels was allowed to move to dortmund in 2009 , and some in the bavarian capital probably regret letting him go .
except for a period when he was injured , the central defender has been a permanent part of coach juergen klopp 's starting line-up .
together with neven subotic , he heads the youngest and best defense in the bundesliga .
and central defense is one area that 's up in the air at the moment for the germany squad .
veteran arne friedrich and holger badstuber are currently out with nagging injuries , and neither per mertesacker nor heiko westermann have impressed this season .
at 191 centimeters , hummels is big enough for the position , and he scores the occasional goal as well .
so do n't be surprised to see him in the starting line-up in sweden - or in the germany squad at the 2012 european championships in poland and ukraine .
marcel schmelzer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schmelzer is good at both ends of the pitch 22-year-old magdeburg native marcel schmelzer made a move to dortmund five years ago , and has worked his way up through the youth team ranks to take the place of veteran brazilian dede in klopp 's starting eleven .
schmelzer is lightning quick and has shown this season that he 's good enough on the ball to keep opposing defenses under constant pressure .
what makes him particularly interesting for loew , though , is the fact that he plays left-back , a position that germany have struggled with in the past .
philipp lahm does n't want to play there , and it 's not a natural role for badstuber or jerome boateng , who have both given it a shot with mixed results .
he 's also likely to be given playing time against the swedes .
and if schmelzer impresses , it 's not hard to see loew thinking he 's too good to leave at home .
kevin grosskreutz bildunterschrift : grosskreutz is joining schmelzer in sweden a local boy and life-long dortmund fan , 22-year-old kevin grosskreutz began kicking the ball around in the club ’ s youth academy and , after returning from second-division ahlen last season , he 's established himself in juergen klopp 's starting 11 .
he 's a hard-working winger who can both score and set up others .
that 's important because loew favors a system with a single center forward and two speedsters feeding in balls from the wings .
grosskreutz is also left-footed , which could make him the perfect understudy for lukas podolski - or replacement should poldi pick up an injury or completely lose his form .
and since podolski has ruled himself out of wednesday 's friendly , grosskreutz will likely get a chance to step up and show what he can do .
mario goetze bildunterschrift : goetze 's slick skills helped topple mainz 18-year-old mario goetze is another dortmund boy through and through , and despite his tender years , he 's played in every match this season save one , scoring two goals and contributing four assists .
bundesliga fans will remember the forward 's cool finish against mainz two rounds ago .
it ushered in the dortmund win that took them top the top of the table .
loew apparently recalls that goal as well , having decided that , despite a lack of experience , goetze was worth a closer look .
of the four youngsters , goetze 's chances of staying with the nationalelf in the coming months are probably the worst .
as long as he 's able to walk unassisted , miroslav klose is a permanent fixture in loew 's squad , and mario gomez and cacau are regulars as well .
but goetze has impressed at every stage of germany 's youth national teams and is certainly a candidate for brazil , if not poland and ukraine .
what is virtually certain is that the side germany fields in 2012 will differ at a number of positions from the one which took third place in south africa .
and the odds are that there will be a noticeable streak of dortmund yellow in the red , black and gold .
