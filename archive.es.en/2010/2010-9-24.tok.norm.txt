program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.09.2010 germany voices reservations about ecuador 's oil fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sight the yasuni itt fund wants to prevent when ecuador first mooted the idea of foregoing massive oil reserves under the yasuni national park in exchange for donations worth half its value , berlin was on board .
but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .
although the bmz says there are no hard plans to talk about the fund , a representative of the quito administration told deutsche welle that the team would take the opportunity to talk germany through its doubts regarding the initiative .

friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.09.2010 germany voices reservations about ecuador 's oil fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sight the yasuni itt fund wants to prevent when ecuador first mooted the idea of foregoing massive oil reserves under the yasuni national park in exchange for donations worth half its value , berlin was on board .
but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.09.2010 germany voices reservations about ecuador 's oil fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sight the yasuni itt fund wants to prevent when ecuador first mooted the idea of foregoing massive oil reserves under the yasuni national park in exchange for donations worth half its value , berlin was on board .
but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .
although the bmz says there are no hard plans to talk about the fund , a representative of the quito administration told deutsche welle that the team would take the opportunity to talk germany through its doubts regarding the initiative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 24.09.2010 german satellite meets fiery end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 years of work up in smoke - but not for nothing after 10 years in orbit and 58277 trips around the earth , the georesearch satellite champ collected material that made for one of the most successful earth observation missions yet , say researchers . it was a quick end to a long life for champ , the challenging mini satellite payload .
after 3718 days of providing information to researchers on the ground , the satellite burnt up on september 19 , 2010 over the sea of okhotsk , somewhere between eastern siberia , the russian peninsular of kamchatka and japan .
it was " one of the most successful observation missions of the earth 's system , " said professor reinhard huettle , ceo of the potsdam-based german research center for geosciences , better known by its german acronym , gfz .
this was the center that first designed the champ project in 1995 .
since then the satellite has provided geoscientists with groundbreaking new insights .
the ' potsdam gravity potato ' the information provided by champ allowed researchers , for instance , to better capture the earth 's form – dips and bulges included .
this allowed researchers to develop an image of earth not as a perfect sphere but as a ' floating potato ' – the ' potsdam gravity potato ' .
bildunterschrift : the ' potato earth ' as seen by champ this was possible because champ was set on an irregular orbit around the earth : at times it was more attracted to the earth , at times less .
for the first time , researchers were able to trace the satellite 's path continuously and accurately , to within centimeters , and were able to reconstruct the shape of the earth second by second .
champ also offered researchers new insights into the earth 's magnetic field , allowing them to recognize that field strength decreases continuously , particularly in the southern atlantic ocean , which in turn leads to frequent disruptions in satellite operation .
what 's more , the satellite allowed for the creation of global maps of important mineral and ore deposits – pointing to iron ore in kursk , russia , and diamonds in west africa – as these deposits could be seen for the first time through analysis of the magnetization of the rock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth 's magnetic field come rain or shine measurements taken by the satellite have also been used in weather forecasting and climate research .
for the first time in 2006 , the british ' met office ' used the satellite 's data to create global weather forecasts .
champ data has also been used in centers in europe , japan and canada .
the satellite also proved unexpectedly useful in monitoring space weather , allowing meteorologists to predict storms in the ionosphere , an outer layer of the earth 's atmosphere , more quickly .
these storms can interfere with telecommunications , satellite navigation and radio-radar systems .
15 years of work the champ project began in 1995 when the german education and research ministry developed a satellite mission as a flagship project for the east german space industry , to try to promote existing knowledge of the field within east germany .
five years on , when the 522kg -lrb- 1150lb -rrb- champ satellite was launched , it was originally thought it would stay in orbit for five years at most .
but the satellite 's design allowed it such a stable flight , even at a low flight path , that the mission time could be more than doubled .

swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .

the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .

we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .

internationally recognized bachelor 's and master 's degrees have replaced virtually all of the degrees formerly conferred . in 1999 , germany signed the bologna reform agreement , which obligates participating european nations to create a more uniform educational system .
by 2020 , all participating countries have agreed to switch over to the bachelor and master system . that means students can get a quicker start in the working world and also earn degrees that are more easily compared and evaluated internationally .
the switch to the bachelor and master system is especially important for foreign students interested in studying in germany , since the changes increase the likelihood that degrees earned abroad will be recognized at home . end of the diplom and magister prior to the bologna reform , german university students earned either a diplom -lrb- in scientific and technical areas -rrb- or a magister -lrb- in the humanities and social sciences -rrb- .
students required at least eight semesters - and typically longer - to complete one of the two degrees . well over 80 percent of the programs at german universities now lead to either a bachelor or master .
a bachelor 's degree is generally intended to be completed after six semesters , while a master takes an additional two years . on the other hand , future lawyers , doctors and pharmacists do not earn degrees according to the bologna reform and are still educated in preparation for a state examination conducted at the end of their studies .
however , the process in these fields will also eventually be replaced with some variation of the bachelor and master system . enrollment requirements to apply for an undergraduate degree in germany , applicants must often show they possess certain credentials , like having adequate german skills and good prior educational records .
additionally , some programs require or recommend an internship prior to enrollment , while some arts academies require qualifying tests .
undergraduate degree programs typically lead to a bachelor or qualify the student to take germany 's state examinations in law or in medicine . master 's degrees typically require a bachelor in the same or a closely related field , while phd programs generally seek students that have earned a master with academic distinction in the same field . author : claudia unseld , gaby reucher editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan .

" but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan . " one thing is clear , if civil society hadn ’ t pitched in people here would be really in bad shape , " says the retired college principal syeda basheer chandio . pakistani civil society mobilized famous television hosts have also been collecting donations in their shows . " the government is helping the people , we can ’ t say they ’ re not doing anything , " says shahzad , an engineer from hyderabad who has been in the flood-affected regions with his colleague yasir for weeks . " but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .

8 after two weeks of escalating tension between japan and china , japanese prosecutors have decided to release the chinese captain of a fishing boat involved in a collision near disputed islands in the east china sea . japan responded to china 's increasingly loud threats to react with " further action " by freeing the 41-year-old zhan qixiong , whom the japanese had accused of deliberately ramming two japanese coastguard vessels . the impact on the japanese people and the relationship between japan and china was cited as the main reason for the release . bildunterschrift : one of the disputed islands in the east china sea , claimed by china and japan the prosecutors said that the captain had not committed a " premeditated criminal act but had acted on the spur of the moment " . tense diplomatic row however , this supposedly spontaneous act took place in disputed territory and sparked a diplomatic row of a scale not seen for a long time . japan calls the chain of islands near the scene of the collision senkaku , whereas china calls it diaoyu .
the two countries claim the islets and the oil-rich surrounding area . on friday , the conservative opposition lashed out at the prosecutors ' decision , saying that they had caved in to chinese pressure unnecessarily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of the fishing boat was released on 13 .
sept. but the captain was detained for longer indeed , earlier this week , seiji maehara , the new japanese foreign minister , had made it crystal clear what japan ’ s position was : " the senkaku islands are an integral part of japan and there is no territorial conflict regarding these islands .
the japanese government will continue to be calm about the situation and will act according to japanese law . " as the dispute escalated , however , the two countries came under international pressure to resolve it through dialogue . china warns prosecutors not to take legal action after hearing the captain would be released , beijing once again repeated that any legal action taken against the captain would be " illegal and invalid " . liu jiangyong , an expert in international relations at qinghua university , accused tokyo of incompetence : " ever since coming to power , the democratic party of japan has been pro-american in foreign policy , and in controversial issues such as international law , bilateral problems between the two nations , and how they should be solved , they have no experience and they don ’ t know the rules and proceedings of international politics . " despite loud accusations and threats , in the end , some analysts predicted , the dispute would not come to much , considering the growing importance of sino-japanese trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute led to anti-japan protests in beijing and hong kong economic necessities outweigh spats china is now japan ’ s biggest trading partner .
christian geltinger , who knows both countries well having spent years in qingdao representing the german state of bavaria and now being based in tokyo had a " easy-going attitude . " " there will always be this kind of spat , " he said .
" but the economic necessity to work together is stronger .
japan has considerably relaxed the entry requirements for chinese travellers and there is a keen desire to exploit the chinese tourist potential in japan .
people already speak good chinese in the stores here and chinese credit cards are accepted .
the real exchange between china and japan has made great progress . " this is a view confirmed by hiroshi tsukamoto , the commissioner general of the japanese pavilion at expo 2010 in shanghai : " we think china is a country of great opportunity .
and shanghai expo is a very good occasion from a business point of view . " some 20,000 chinese visitors a day pop into the japanese pavilion , where they can see what the future bodes by playing with robots or checking out the latest high-tech gadgets . author : anne thomas editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

or how about an unforgettable , quick gift ?
consumers in madrid can now use a unique automated teller machine to fetch gold bars of up to 10 grams and coins with custom designs in exchange for cash .
the atm , known as " gold to go , " is the brainchild of thomas geissler .

first atm in the emirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gold atm dispenses bars and coins the first gold atm , located in one of the city 's top hotels , the emirates palace hotel , will be followed over the coming weeks with several more machines in top sites in the united arab emirates .
now gold enthusiasts in europe are on geissler 's radar , too .
spain is among the first of several targeted markets in europe , including austria , germany and switzerland .
in madrid , the gold dispenser is located in the five-star westin palace hotel , a favorite stomping ground for the rich and famous .
soaring demand for gold at first glance , some people could mistake the six-foot tall , gold-leaf-finished machine as some tacky casino attraction .
but the machine is actually packed with some high-tech , including a computer that updates gold prices every 10 minutes , a video surveillance camera and an id scanner .

the gold atm comes as demand for the precious metal soars , with investors scrambling to seek a safe haven from the global economic turbulence .
besides the well-healed , the " gold to go " vending machine also hopes to attact less deep-pocketed consumers who wish to give special gifts .
the smallest gold coin is available for 40 euros .

the us wants more european troops in afghanistan , but this could prove a tall order . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg , speaking on the sidelines of an informal meeting with his european counterparts in the northern belgian city of ghent , said that germany intends to increase its efforts training the afghan security forces .
guttenberg said that as many as 1,600 soldiers could be conducting this role by the end of october .
however , the defense minister was also keen to stress that this would not involve committing any more troops to the publicly unpopular afghan mission than the government in berlin had previously promised .
" our mandate is very clearly formulated , and we will stick to it while it is valid , " guttenberg said .
" we have n't even reached the -lrb- upper limit for troop levels of -rrb- 5,000 yet - we 'll hit that level around at the end of october , when we have finished deploying the second training and protection battalion . "
germany 's current mandate for the afghan mission , which is reviewed and renewed each year , allows for an upper limit of 5,000 soldiers and a reserve of 350 ; it expires in february 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is to train afghan forces and let them take over increasing efforts towards training the afghan security forces is part of the overall isaf strategy of mission commander david petraeus .
the ultimate goal is to train and equip a self-sufficient local military and police force , allowing western forces to start withdrawing from the country .
earlier in the week , the us general asked for an extra 2,000 soldiers from washington 's nato partners to this end .
europe reluctant to boost levels nato sources report that european allies feel they can not meet petraeus ' requests .
politically , several countries are unwilling to commit more troops to a mission that 's unpopular among the electorate , and financially , most nato partners feel they do n't have the necessary resources .
" it 's not just germany that 's discussing ways to facilitate more professional and faster cooperation with nato partners on the ground , " defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said , suggesting it might be possible improve efficiency instead of boosting troop levels .
" all our european partners are discussing ways to achieve this , and some are already implementing them , therefore , i see great potential in this direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says germany will stick to its current mandate some european projects along these lines include improving military helicopters in the region , and the shared usage of cargo planes to save resources .
the cost of the military mission is beginning to hurt european countries , many of whom are battling to reduce their public expenditure and national debts .
" europe has more military personnel than the us , we have two million troops in europe , compared to america 's 1.4 million , " german free democrat alexander graf lambsdorff , a member of the european parliament , said .
" yet we spend 200 billion dollars on our armed forces , while the us spends 500 billion .
that means we are still light years behind the us in terms of equipment , training , and protecting our forces in the field . "
lambsdorff also mentioned the dangers of sending troops to the region without the necessary financial backing , saying this could lead to problems for the soldiers like missing or inferior equipment .
he said european nato members had no choice but to act within their limitations .
the eu defense minister meeting in ghent was not expected to yield any fixed resolutions , the informal talks serve as an exchange of experience and ideas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 24.09.2010 scientists warn of possible peril from 2013 solar flare activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this photograph of the sun , taken december 19 , 1973 , by nasa 's skylab 4 , shows one of the most spectacular solar flares ever recorded researchers warn at a london conference that a large-scale solar flare could disrupt satellites in orbit and power stations on earth .
however , not all scientists are convinced of its wide destructive power . earlier this week , scientists attending the electric infrastructure security council conference in london warned that a massive solar flare may trigger global chaos by causing blackouts and wrecking satellite communications . solar flares are large explosions on the surface of the sun , powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy that has built up in the sun 's atmosphere .
they can last just a few seconds or up to an hour , and can occur in smaller intensities as often as several times per day .
the researchers say that this potential disaster could occur within three years , which is when astronomers forecast a peak in the sun 's magnetic energy cycle .
they say that the resulting solar storm could potentially cause geomagnetic mayhem on earth , knocking out electricity grids around the world .
" as that magnetic field gets tangled up it gets more and more energetic , and that leads to an eleven year cycle of activity , " explained chris davis , a scientist on the solar stormwatch project at the british royal observatory , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we 're on a low level of activity at the moment but sunspots are starting to appear again , and spots are the manifestation of this magnetic field poking through the surface of the sun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the expected effects of the 2013 solar flare is that the northern lights will be able to be seen at higher latitudes previous large solar ejection occured in 19th century astronomers say that the current cycle of solar flare activity started around 2001 and they expect it to reach a peak sometime in 2013 .
but what 's different about this peak is that it could be quite devastating .
the coronal mass ejection could release large amounts of matter , intense magnetic fields and other radiation into space .
typically , some scientists say , ejections of this size only occur approximately every 150 years – the last one was in 1859 .
" the world 's skies were bathed in a blood red aurora – the northern and the southern lights , " said stuart clark , a british astronomy journalist and author of " the sun kings " , which details the event and its impact on modern astronomy .
" and at the same time as these lights appeared in the sky , the nineteenth century equivalent of global communications and navigation just completely stopped working . "
in other words , clark explained , compasses spun uselessly and the telegraph – cutting-edge technology at the time – crashed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar flare in 1989 caused the disruption of power plants and transmission stations in quebec , canada solar flares have disrupted power transmission before today , given that the 21st century relies so heavily on other technology like communications and entertainment satellites , the world is more at risk from damage caused by high-energy particles and other disturbances , said avi schnurr , who organized the conference .
he is a former us department of defense analyst , and current executive director of the israel missile defense association , a lobbying organization .
in addition to affecting spacecraft , such magnetic storms can affect power transmission behavior on the earth , because they cause " transformer saturation , " which reduces or distorts voltage .
that could mean the disruption of power plants and transmission stations , which happened in the province of quebec in canada during a solar flare in 1989 . " the electric grids when they go down , they bring with them our capability to produce water and send water to homes , to produce food , communications , medical care .
all the things we depend on . "
schnurr said .
" and if it 's down for months or years , it 's very painful to think what that would mean . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an australian government scientist dismissed schnurr 's claims as ' overstated ' other scientists say threat is ' overstated ' but not all scientists are convinced of this high level of damage that a solar ejection would cause to the earth in 2013 .
in an interview published friday with the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc -rrb- , phil wilkinson , the assistant director of the australian bureau of meteorology 's ionospheric prediction service , said that the claims that this solar maximum would be the most violent in 100 years are " overstated . "
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- going far beyond what 's realistic and could be worrying or concerning for people who do n't really understand the underlying science behind it all , " he said .
" the real message should be that the coming solar maximum period could be equally as hazardous as any other solar maximum . "
he also said that the impact on power grids would be minimal .
" at worst , it 's a regional thing , not a global thing as these reports imply , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author stuart clark says it would be foolish of governments to ignore warnings about solar flares infrastructure could be protected by ' huge surge protectors ' however , schnurr also said that protecting infrastructure both on the ground and in space is a matter of politics and money .
" we do need to get it together for the governments involved to start protecting the electric grids , " he said .
" but it turns out there are fairly simple measures which are well understood now which can be taken .
there are the equivalents of huge surge protectors which need to be put on these different transformers . "
this " equivalent " is known as a residual current device , or rcd , which is used for domestic wiring systems .
these are trip switches installed on electricity transmission lines that break the connection when there 's a sudden voltage increase .
there would be a temporary disruption in power , but the transformers themselves would be protected .

however , not all scientists are convinced of its wide destructive power . earlier this week , scientists attending the electric infrastructure security council conference in london warned that a massive solar flare may trigger global chaos by causing blackouts and wrecking satellite communications . solar flares are large explosions on the surface of the sun , powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy that has built up in the sun 's atmosphere .
they can last just a few seconds or up to an hour , and can occur in smaller intensities as often as several times per day .
the researchers say that this potential disaster could occur within three years , which is when astronomers forecast a peak in the sun 's magnetic energy cycle .
they say that the resulting solar storm could potentially cause geomagnetic mayhem on earth , knocking out electricity grids around the world .
" as that magnetic field gets tangled up it gets more and more energetic , and that leads to an eleven year cycle of activity , " explained chris davis , a scientist on the solar stormwatch project at the british royal observatory , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we 're on a low level of activity at the moment but sunspots are starting to appear again , and spots are the manifestation of this magnetic field poking through the surface of the sun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the expected effects of the 2013 solar flare is that the northern lights will be able to be seen at higher latitudes previous large solar ejection occured in 19th century astronomers say that the current cycle of solar flare activity started around 2001 and they expect it to reach a peak sometime in 2013 .
but what 's different about this peak is that it could be quite devastating .
the coronal mass ejection could release large amounts of matter , intense magnetic fields and other radiation into space .
typically , some scientists say , ejections of this size only occur approximately every 150 years – the last one was in 1859 .
" the world 's skies were bathed in a blood red aurora – the northern and the southern lights , " said stuart clark , a british astronomy journalist and author of " the sun kings " , which details the event and its impact on modern astronomy .
" and at the same time as these lights appeared in the sky , the nineteenth century equivalent of global communications and navigation just completely stopped working . "
in other words , clark explained , compasses spun uselessly and the telegraph – cutting-edge technology at the time – crashed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar flare in 1989 caused the disruption of power plants and transmission stations in quebec , canada solar flares have disrupted power transmission before today , given that the 21st century relies so heavily on other technology like communications and entertainment satellites , the world is more at risk from damage caused by high-energy particles and other disturbances , said avi schnurr , who organized the conference .
he is a former us department of defense analyst , and current executive director of the israel missile defense association , a lobbying organization .
in addition to affecting spacecraft , such magnetic storms can affect power transmission behavior on the earth , because they cause " transformer saturation , " which reduces or distorts voltage .
that could mean the disruption of power plants and transmission stations , which happened in the province of quebec in canada during a solar flare in 1989 . " the electric grids when they go down , they bring with them our capability to produce water and send water to homes , to produce food , communications , medical care .
all the things we depend on . "
schnurr said .
" and if it 's down for months or years , it 's very painful to think what that would mean . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an australian government scientist dismissed schnurr 's claims as ' overstated ' other scientists say threat is ' overstated ' but not all scientists are convinced of this high level of damage that a solar ejection would cause to the earth in 2013 .
in an interview published friday with the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc -rrb- , phil wilkinson , the assistant director of the australian bureau of meteorology 's ionospheric prediction service , said that the claims that this solar maximum would be the most violent in 100 years are " overstated . "
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- going far beyond what 's realistic and could be worrying or concerning for people who do n't really understand the underlying science behind it all , " he said .
" the real message should be that the coming solar maximum period could be equally as hazardous as any other solar maximum . "
he also said that the impact on power grids would be minimal .
" at worst , it 's a regional thing , not a global thing as these reports imply , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author stuart clark says it would be foolish of governments to ignore warnings about solar flares infrastructure could be protected by ' huge surge protectors ' however , schnurr also said that protecting infrastructure both on the ground and in space is a matter of politics and money .
" we do need to get it together for the governments involved to start protecting the electric grids , " he said .
" but it turns out there are fairly simple measures which are well understood now which can be taken .
there are the equivalents of huge surge protectors which need to be put on these different transformers . "
this " equivalent " is known as a residual current device , or rcd , which is used for domestic wiring systems .
these are trip switches installed on electricity transmission lines that break the connection when there 's a sudden voltage increase .
there would be a temporary disruption in power , but the transformers themselves would be protected .
rcds , schnurr explained , are roughly analogous to surge protectors used in ordinary homes to protect electronic devices from overloading .
he also said that the cost of installing such preventive measures is relatively inexpensive to governments – in the united kingdom , it would cost a few hundred million dollars .

however , not all scientists are convinced of its wide destructive power . earlier this week , scientists attending the electric infrastructure security council conference in london warned that a massive solar flare may trigger global chaos by causing blackouts and wrecking satellite communications . solar flares are large explosions on the surface of the sun , powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy that has built up in the sun 's atmosphere .
they can last just a few seconds or up to an hour , and can occur in smaller intensities as often as several times per day .
the researchers say that this potential disaster could occur within three years , which is when astronomers forecast a peak in the sun 's magnetic energy cycle .
they say that the resulting solar storm could potentially cause geomagnetic mayhem on earth , knocking out electricity grids around the world .
" as that magnetic field gets tangled up it gets more and more energetic , and that leads to an eleven year cycle of activity , " explained chris davis , a scientist on the solar stormwatch project at the british royal observatory , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we 're on a low level of activity at the moment but sunspots are starting to appear again , and spots are the manifestation of this magnetic field poking through the surface of the sun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the expected effects of the 2013 solar flare is that the northern lights will be able to be seen at higher latitudes previous large solar ejection occured in 19th century astronomers say that the current cycle of solar flare activity started around 2001 and they expect it to reach a peak sometime in 2013 .
but what 's different about this peak is that it could be quite devastating .
the coronal mass ejection could release large amounts of matter , intense magnetic fields and other radiation into space .
typically , some scientists say , ejections of this size only occur approximately every 150 years – the last one was in 1859 .
" the world 's skies were bathed in a blood red aurora – the northern and the southern lights , " said stuart clark , a british astronomy journalist and author of " the sun kings " , which details the event and its impact on modern astronomy .
" and at the same time as these lights appeared in the sky , the nineteenth century equivalent of global communications and navigation just completely stopped working . "
in other words , clark explained , compasses spun uselessly and the telegraph – cutting-edge technology at the time – crashed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar flare in 1989 caused the disruption of power plants and transmission stations in quebec , canada solar flares have disrupted power transmission before today , given that the 21st century relies so heavily on other technology like communications and entertainment satellites , the world is more at risk from damage caused by high-energy particles and other disturbances , said avi schnurr , who organized the conference .
he is a former us department of defense analyst , and current executive director of the israel missile defense association , a lobbying organization .
in addition to affecting spacecraft , such magnetic storms can affect power transmission behavior on the earth , because they cause " transformer saturation , " which reduces or distorts voltage .
that could mean the disruption of power plants and transmission stations , which happened in the province of quebec in canada during a solar flare in 1989 . " the electric grids when they go down , they bring with them our capability to produce water and send water to homes , to produce food , communications , medical care .
all the things we depend on . "
schnurr said .
" and if it 's down for months or years , it 's very painful to think what that would mean . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an australian government scientist dismissed schnurr 's claims as ' overstated ' other scientists say threat is ' overstated ' but not all scientists are convinced of this high level of damage that a solar ejection would cause to the earth in 2013 .
in an interview published friday with the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc -rrb- , phil wilkinson , the assistant director of the australian bureau of meteorology 's ionospheric prediction service , said that the claims that this solar maximum would be the most violent in 100 years are " overstated . "
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- going far beyond what 's realistic and could be worrying or concerning for people who do n't really understand the underlying science behind it all , " he said .
" the real message should be that the coming solar maximum period could be equally as hazardous as any other solar maximum . "
he also said that the impact on power grids would be minimal .
" at worst , it 's a regional thing , not a global thing as these reports imply , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author stuart clark says it would be foolish of governments to ignore warnings about solar flares infrastructure could be protected by ' huge surge protectors ' however , schnurr also said that protecting infrastructure both on the ground and in space is a matter of politics and money .
" we do need to get it together for the governments involved to start protecting the electric grids , " he said .
" but it turns out there are fairly simple measures which are well understood now which can be taken .
there are the equivalents of huge surge protectors which need to be put on these different transformers . "
this " equivalent " is known as a residual current device , or rcd , which is used for domestic wiring systems .
these are trip switches installed on electricity transmission lines that break the connection when there 's a sudden voltage increase .
there would be a temporary disruption in power , but the transformers themselves would be protected .
rcds , schnurr explained , are roughly analogous to surge protectors used in ordinary homes to protect electronic devices from overloading .
he also said that the cost of installing such preventive measures is relatively inexpensive to governments – in the united kingdom , it would cost a few hundred million dollars .
but with so many governments slashing their budgets in the united states , europe and around the globe , it 's still not clear whether governments will actually spend money on an event of which the consequences are not predicted with 100 percent certainty .
after all , similar warnings were made over the y2k bug , the massive worldwide computer glitch , that seemed to be overblown .
still , stuart clark said that governments can not afford to ignore these warnings .
" the consequences if this does happen are just unbelievable , " he said .
" the loss of the power grid for years , loss of the ability to perform any kind of finance or electronic transfers or anything like that , if we do n't do anything to protect ourselves now . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.09.2010 us-vietnam nuclear deal has experts divided großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-vietnam deal can be interpreted as a move to counter chinese influence the united states and vietnam are close to a nuclear deal that would allow hanoi the right to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium .
while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .

" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan . " one thing is clear , if civil society hadn ’ t pitched in people here would be really in bad shape , " says the retired college principal syeda basheer chandio . pakistani civil society mobilized famous television hosts have also been collecting donations in their shows . " the government is helping the people , we can ’ t say they ’ re not doing anything , " says shahzad , an engineer from hyderabad who has been in the flood-affected regions with his colleague yasir for weeks . " but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .
what can we do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects . " the international community will probably invest billions into pakistan ’ s reconstruction but it would do well to take time to find out how the money can be used most efficiently . author : thomas baerthlein -lrb- hyderabad -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking at the conclusion of the two-day autumn plenary assembly of the german bishops ' conference in the central city of fulda , zollitsch said " the issue of the ... personal , spiritual and sacramental life of our clergy has long been pressing . "
the bishops ' conference was now " taking the initiative toward dialogue that involves itself as well as the diocese , " he said .
" that includes ways to talk about awkward subjects in the area of sexuality , the vow of celibacy or the receiving of the sacrament by divorcees , " he said .
zollitsch also addressed the recent austerity drive initiated by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which he labeled as socially unbalanced .

the german prelate said the details of any compensation deals would be discussed next week at a round table meeting on abuse set up by the government last march .

after 3718 days of providing information to researchers on the ground , the satellite burnt up on september 19 , 2010 over the sea of okhotsk , somewhere between eastern siberia , the russian peninsular of kamchatka and japan .
it was " one of the most successful observation missions of the earth 's system , " said professor reinhard huettle , ceo of the potsdam-based german research center for geosciences , better known by its german acronym , gfz .
this was the center that first designed the champ project in 1995 .
since then the satellite has provided geoscientists with groundbreaking new insights .
the ' potsdam gravity potato ' the information provided by champ allowed researchers , for instance , to better capture the earth 's form – dips and bulges included .
this allowed researchers to develop an image of earth not as a perfect sphere but as a ' floating potato ' – the ' potsdam gravity potato ' .
bildunterschrift : the ' potato earth ' as seen by champ this was possible because champ was set on an irregular orbit around the earth : at times it was more attracted to the earth , at times less .
for the first time , researchers were able to trace the satellite 's path continuously and accurately , to within centimeters , and were able to reconstruct the shape of the earth second by second .
champ also offered researchers new insights into the earth 's magnetic field , allowing them to recognize that field strength decreases continuously , particularly in the southern atlantic ocean , which in turn leads to frequent disruptions in satellite operation .
what 's more , the satellite allowed for the creation of global maps of important mineral and ore deposits – pointing to iron ore in kursk , russia , and diamonds in west africa – as these deposits could be seen for the first time through analysis of the magnetization of the rock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth 's magnetic field come rain or shine measurements taken by the satellite have also been used in weather forecasting and climate research .
for the first time in 2006 , the british ' met office ' used the satellite 's data to create global weather forecasts .
champ data has also been used in centers in europe , japan and canada .
the satellite also proved unexpectedly useful in monitoring space weather , allowing meteorologists to predict storms in the ionosphere , an outer layer of the earth 's atmosphere , more quickly .
these storms can interfere with telecommunications , satellite navigation and radio-radar systems .
15 years of work the champ project began in 1995 when the german education and research ministry developed a satellite mission as a flagship project for the east german space industry , to try to promote existing knowledge of the field within east germany .
five years on , when the 522kg -lrb- 1150lb -rrb- champ satellite was launched , it was originally thought it would stay in orbit for five years at most .
but the satellite 's design allowed it such a stable flight , even at a low flight path , that the mission time could be more than doubled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.09.2010 germany voices reservations about ecuador 's oil fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sight the yasuni itt fund wants to prevent when ecuador first mooted the idea of foregoing massive oil reserves under the yasuni national park in exchange for donations worth half its value , berlin was on board .
but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .

but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .

the move could save billions from national defense budgets . european defense ministers meeting in belgium have discussed the need to step up military and defense cooperation in a bid to cut billions of euros from domestic defense budgets .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was among those who championed the idea of closer cooperation on defense at the meeting in the city of ghent , but acknowledged that any such plan would face significant obstacles .
" we should join our forces more , but we also have to see the hurdles , " guttenberg said .
" these are national hurdles .
in germany , for example , parliament has to agree to every foreign mission .
while that has been a very good thing , it can also be an obstacle in the european context . "
the proposal is that , in the future , eu countries could cut defense budgets in two ways : first , different member states could specialize in different aspects of defense , and second , the bloc could band together in the defense procurement process to secure better deals .
guttenberg has also pushed his own three-step model to help aid such defense cooperation .
the plan would first involve defining those domestic defense capabilities that were absolutely necessary for individual eu member states , then ascertaining the areas in which cooperation could bring savings , and , finally , allocating defense specialties to individual countries , which would then make their defense resources available to other eu members in the case of emergencies .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says eu members could specialize their defense capabilities christian schmidt , parliamentary secretary at the german defense ministry , said on the sidelines of the ministers ' meeting that the pressure on governments to cut costs had " led to the realization that we have a lot of common interests in europe . "
" there is a general consensus that in these current times we can not afford to carry out operations at the same capacity nor as efficiently . "
guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal grouping in the european parliament , went one step further , arguing for a common european army .
" we have now a diplomatic service , which is very important , but we also need the other instrument - a common european defense , a common european army , " he said .
" and certainly , at a time when every european country has to make savings , maybe it 's the right time to build up this common european army .
there are two million soldiers in europe , but only 300,000 in the us , and i think that the american army is more efficient that the european forces .
so that 's a good reason to start this . "
sino-american dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morin says defense cooperation would minimize the influence of the us on europe the french defense minister , herve morin , said that if europe failed to boost defense cooperation , it risked becoming a puppet of the united states and china .
" at the rate we 're going , we risk europe gradually becoming a protectorate - 50 years from now we 'll become a pawn in the balance between the new powers and we 'll be under a joint dominion of china and america , " morin told reporters .
" all the countries of the world are re-arming and the europeans , who already before the crisis had really weak budgets , have now carried out new reductions . "
the french defense minister said eu states should formulate a list of defense capabilities that should remain under the control of individual states and those that should be shared .
also on the agenda at the meeting was the ongoing conflict in afghanistan .
german defense minister guttenberg said germany intended to increase its efforts in training security forces in the country .
he said that as many as 1,600 soldiers could be performing this task by the end of october .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.09.2010 germany voices reservations about ecuador 's oil fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sight the yasuni itt fund wants to prevent when ecuador first mooted the idea of foregoing massive oil reserves under the yasuni national park in exchange for donations worth half its value , berlin was on board .
but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .
although the bmz says there are no hard plans to talk about the fund , a representative of the quito administration told deutsche welle that the team would take the opportunity to talk germany through its doubts regarding the initiative .

but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .
although the bmz says there are no hard plans to talk about the fund , a representative of the quito administration told deutsche welle that the team would take the opportunity to talk germany through its doubts regarding the initiative .

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .

over the next decade , around 10,000 turbines are expected to become operational around britain 's coasts .
" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .
we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .
critics have questioned the costs and efficiency of the government 's wind energy plans , given their dependency on the variable powers of the wind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.09.2010 eastern germany is western germany 's trillion euro bet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a paint job was needed in eastern germany german reunification , 20 years underway , has consumed billions of taxpayers ' euros in the more affluent western half of the country .
so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.09.2010 eastern germany is western germany 's trillion euro bet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a paint job was needed in eastern germany german reunification , 20 years underway , has consumed billions of taxpayers ' euros in the more affluent western half of the country .
so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects . " the international community will probably invest billions into pakistan ’ s reconstruction but it would do well to take time to find out how the money can be used most efficiently . author : thomas baerthlein -lrb- hyderabad -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

8 after two weeks of escalating tension between japan and china , japanese prosecutors have decided to release the chinese captain of a fishing boat involved in a collision near disputed islands in the east china sea . japan responded to china 's increasingly loud threats to react with " further action " by freeing the 41-year-old zhan qixiong , whom the japanese had accused of deliberately ramming two japanese coastguard vessels . the impact on the japanese people and the relationship between japan and china was cited as the main reason for the release . bildunterschrift : one of the disputed islands in the east china sea , claimed by china and japan the prosecutors said that the captain had not committed a " premeditated criminal act but had acted on the spur of the moment " . tense diplomatic row however , this supposedly spontaneous act took place in disputed territory and sparked a diplomatic row of a scale not seen for a long time . japan calls the chain of islands near the scene of the collision senkaku , whereas china calls it diaoyu .

the japanese government will continue to be calm about the situation and will act according to japanese law . " as the dispute escalated , however , the two countries came under international pressure to resolve it through dialogue . china warns prosecutors not to take legal action after hearing the captain would be released , beijing once again repeated that any legal action taken against the captain would be " illegal and invalid " . liu jiangyong , an expert in international relations at qinghua university , accused tokyo of incompetence : " ever since coming to power , the democratic party of japan has been pro-american in foreign policy , and in controversial issues such as international law , bilateral problems between the two nations , and how they should be solved , they have no experience and they don ’ t know the rules and proceedings of international politics . " despite loud accusations and threats , in the end , some analysts predicted , the dispute would not come to much , considering the growing importance of sino-japanese trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute led to anti-japan protests in beijing and hong kong economic necessities outweigh spats china is now japan ’ s biggest trading partner .

at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .

while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "

" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .
although the bmz says there are no hard plans to talk about the fund , a representative of the quito administration told deutsche welle that the team would take the opportunity to talk germany through its doubts regarding the initiative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.09.2010 germany voices reservations about ecuador 's oil fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sight the yasuni itt fund wants to prevent when ecuador first mooted the idea of foregoing massive oil reserves under the yasuni national park in exchange for donations worth half its value , berlin was on board .
but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .

now she has released a highly criticized book about it , as john laurenson reports in this postcard from paris . it was a photo that went around the world : ingrid betancourt , frail , pale and thin , her hair down to her waist , her eyes lowered in submission like a latter-day joan of arc .
the snapshot of the french-colombian politician taken by her captors in the middle of the jungle is a moving one , which redoubled the activity of her support groups , especially among politicians , journalists and actors in france .

her memoir " even silence has an end " tells us what happened over the next six-and-a-half years .
there were mosquitoes and snakes , humiliations meted out by her guards .
she writes of her faith that buoyed her up and her wonderment at the beauty of the jungle .
but there was also her collapsing health , malaria and meager diet - the meals of flour and , if she was lucky , monkey meat .
towards the end of her ordeal , her fervent catholic faith abandoned her , causing the steep decline of hope and her gradual slipping towards death .
she describes how , on five occasions , she escaped - only to be stopped by the enormous and hostile jungle and captured again .
and she makes it clear she was sexually abused by her guards .
the book was handwritten , as if , perhaps , she were still denying herself the luxury of a computer in the world of celebrity , wealth and freedom she has returned to .
she told french media that she had intended to write in spanish but ultimately found the experience too painful , and turned to french , the language she was schooled in .
critical voices but reactions by betancourt 's fellow hostages have soured the book 's international release this week .
her presidential running-mate clara rojas has sharply criticized the book , saying it contains " lies and spite . "
rojas had a baby in 2006 while being held captive but , she says , she did not request to have the child in captivity as betancourt claims in her book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's john laurenson reviews betancourt 's moving account " how dare she insinuate something like that without evidence , " rojas said .

other former hostages who spent time in captivity alongside betancourt have also spoken out against her , calling her arrogant .
her estranged husband juan carlos lecompte has filed for divorce , citing her infidelity .
her recent request for millions of dollars in compensation from the colombian government , which she later withdrew , has brought her further disapproval .
nonetheless , " even silence has an end " shows that she is also capable of self-criticism .

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .

over the next decade , around 10,000 turbines are expected to become operational around britain 's coasts .
" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .
we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .
critics have questioned the costs and efficiency of the government 's wind energy plans , given their dependency on the variable powers of the wind .

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy secretary chris huhne said the uk was in a unique position to harness wind energy potential world wind leader ?
over the next decade , around 10,000 turbines are expected to become operational around britain 's coasts .
" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .
we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .
critics have questioned the costs and efficiency of the government 's wind energy plans , given their dependency on the variable powers of the wind .

8 after two weeks of escalating tension between japan and china , japanese prosecutors have decided to release the chinese captain of a fishing boat involved in a collision near disputed islands in the east china sea . japan responded to china 's increasingly loud threats to react with " further action " by freeing the 41-year-old zhan qixiong , whom the japanese had accused of deliberately ramming two japanese coastguard vessels . the impact on the japanese people and the relationship between japan and china was cited as the main reason for the release . bildunterschrift : one of the disputed islands in the east china sea , claimed by china and japan the prosecutors said that the captain had not committed a " premeditated criminal act but had acted on the spur of the moment " . tense diplomatic row however , this supposedly spontaneous act took place in disputed territory and sparked a diplomatic row of a scale not seen for a long time . japan calls the chain of islands near the scene of the collision senkaku , whereas china calls it diaoyu .
the two countries claim the islets and the oil-rich surrounding area . on friday , the conservative opposition lashed out at the prosecutors ' decision , saying that they had caved in to chinese pressure unnecessarily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of the fishing boat was released on 13 .
sept. but the captain was detained for longer indeed , earlier this week , seiji maehara , the new japanese foreign minister , had made it crystal clear what japan ’ s position was : " the senkaku islands are an integral part of japan and there is no territorial conflict regarding these islands .
the japanese government will continue to be calm about the situation and will act according to japanese law . " as the dispute escalated , however , the two countries came under international pressure to resolve it through dialogue . china warns prosecutors not to take legal action after hearing the captain would be released , beijing once again repeated that any legal action taken against the captain would be " illegal and invalid " . liu jiangyong , an expert in international relations at qinghua university , accused tokyo of incompetence : " ever since coming to power , the democratic party of japan has been pro-american in foreign policy , and in controversial issues such as international law , bilateral problems between the two nations , and how they should be solved , they have no experience and they don ’ t know the rules and proceedings of international politics . " despite loud accusations and threats , in the end , some analysts predicted , the dispute would not come to much , considering the growing importance of sino-japanese trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute led to anti-japan protests in beijing and hong kong economic necessities outweigh spats china is now japan ’ s biggest trading partner .
christian geltinger , who knows both countries well having spent years in qingdao representing the german state of bavaria and now being based in tokyo had a " easy-going attitude . " " there will always be this kind of spat , " he said .
" but the economic necessity to work together is stronger .
japan has considerably relaxed the entry requirements for chinese travellers and there is a keen desire to exploit the chinese tourist potential in japan .
people already speak good chinese in the stores here and chinese credit cards are accepted .
the real exchange between china and japan has made great progress . " this is a view confirmed by hiroshi tsukamoto , the commissioner general of the japanese pavilion at expo 2010 in shanghai : " we think china is a country of great opportunity .
and shanghai expo is a very good occasion from a business point of view . " some 20,000 chinese visitors a day pop into the japanese pavilion , where they can see what the future bodes by playing with robots or checking out the latest high-tech gadgets . author : anne thomas editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

8 after two weeks of escalating tension between japan and china , japanese prosecutors have decided to release the chinese captain of a fishing boat involved in a collision near disputed islands in the east china sea . japan responded to china 's increasingly loud threats to react with " further action " by freeing the 41-year-old zhan qixiong , whom the japanese had accused of deliberately ramming two japanese coastguard vessels . the impact on the japanese people and the relationship between japan and china was cited as the main reason for the release . bildunterschrift : one of the disputed islands in the east china sea , claimed by china and japan the prosecutors said that the captain had not committed a " premeditated criminal act but had acted on the spur of the moment " . tense diplomatic row however , this supposedly spontaneous act took place in disputed territory and sparked a diplomatic row of a scale not seen for a long time . japan calls the chain of islands near the scene of the collision senkaku , whereas china calls it diaoyu .
the two countries claim the islets and the oil-rich surrounding area . on friday , the conservative opposition lashed out at the prosecutors ' decision , saying that they had caved in to chinese pressure unnecessarily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of the fishing boat was released on 13 .
sept. but the captain was detained for longer indeed , earlier this week , seiji maehara , the new japanese foreign minister , had made it crystal clear what japan ’ s position was : " the senkaku islands are an integral part of japan and there is no territorial conflict regarding these islands .
the japanese government will continue to be calm about the situation and will act according to japanese law . " as the dispute escalated , however , the two countries came under international pressure to resolve it through dialogue . china warns prosecutors not to take legal action after hearing the captain would be released , beijing once again repeated that any legal action taken against the captain would be " illegal and invalid " . liu jiangyong , an expert in international relations at qinghua university , accused tokyo of incompetence : " ever since coming to power , the democratic party of japan has been pro-american in foreign policy , and in controversial issues such as international law , bilateral problems between the two nations , and how they should be solved , they have no experience and they don ’ t know the rules and proceedings of international politics . " despite loud accusations and threats , in the end , some analysts predicted , the dispute would not come to much , considering the growing importance of sino-japanese trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute led to anti-japan protests in beijing and hong kong economic necessities outweigh spats china is now japan ’ s biggest trading partner .
christian geltinger , who knows both countries well having spent years in qingdao representing the german state of bavaria and now being based in tokyo had a " easy-going attitude . " " there will always be this kind of spat , " he said .
" but the economic necessity to work together is stronger .
japan has considerably relaxed the entry requirements for chinese travellers and there is a keen desire to exploit the chinese tourist potential in japan .
people already speak good chinese in the stores here and chinese credit cards are accepted .
the real exchange between china and japan has made great progress . " this is a view confirmed by hiroshi tsukamoto , the commissioner general of the japanese pavilion at expo 2010 in shanghai : " we think china is a country of great opportunity .
and shanghai expo is a very good occasion from a business point of view . " some 20,000 chinese visitors a day pop into the japanese pavilion , where they can see what the future bodes by playing with robots or checking out the latest high-tech gadgets . author : anne thomas editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , that demonstration was dwarfed by earlier marches through the city that attracted tens of thousands of protesters . the stuttgart 21 project aims to completely remodel the city 's train station , as well as transform the state of baden-wuerttemberg into a major hub of european rail transportation .
stuttgart would become part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . baden-wuerttemberg 's state government has said it is prepared to discuss the planning of the project , while stuttgart 21 opponents want to discuss the costs , traffic issues and alternatives to the underground through-station for high-speed trains . earlier attempts at organizing round table talks failed after supporters of the 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- project refused to halt demolition work to the part of the railway station .
opponents have ruled out returning to talks until demolition is halted and a referendum held .

the us wants more european troops in afghanistan , but this could prove a tall order . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg , speaking on the sidelines of an informal meeting with his european counterparts in the northern belgian city of ghent , said that germany intends to increase its efforts training the afghan security forces .
guttenberg said that as many as 1,600 soldiers could be conducting this role by the end of october .
however , the defense minister was also keen to stress that this would not involve committing any more troops to the publicly unpopular afghan mission than the government in berlin had previously promised .
" our mandate is very clearly formulated , and we will stick to it while it is valid , " guttenberg said .
" we have n't even reached the -lrb- upper limit for troop levels of -rrb- 5,000 yet - we 'll hit that level around at the end of october , when we have finished deploying the second training and protection battalion . "
germany 's current mandate for the afghan mission , which is reviewed and renewed each year , allows for an upper limit of 5,000 soldiers and a reserve of 350 ; it expires in february 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is to train afghan forces and let them take over increasing efforts towards training the afghan security forces is part of the overall isaf strategy of mission commander david petraeus .
the ultimate goal is to train and equip a self-sufficient local military and police force , allowing western forces to start withdrawing from the country .
earlier in the week , the us general asked for an extra 2,000 soldiers from washington 's nato partners to this end .
europe reluctant to boost levels nato sources report that european allies feel they can not meet petraeus ' requests .
politically , several countries are unwilling to commit more troops to a mission that 's unpopular among the electorate , and financially , most nato partners feel they do n't have the necessary resources .
" it 's not just germany that 's discussing ways to facilitate more professional and faster cooperation with nato partners on the ground , " defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said , suggesting it might be possible improve efficiency instead of boosting troop levels .
" all our european partners are discussing ways to achieve this , and some are already implementing them , therefore , i see great potential in this direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says germany will stick to its current mandate some european projects along these lines include improving military helicopters in the region , and the shared usage of cargo planes to save resources .
the cost of the military mission is beginning to hurt european countries , many of whom are battling to reduce their public expenditure and national debts .
" europe has more military personnel than the us , we have two million troops in europe , compared to america 's 1.4 million , " german free democrat alexander graf lambsdorff , a member of the european parliament , said .
" yet we spend 200 billion dollars on our armed forces , while the us spends 500 billion .
that means we are still light years behind the us in terms of equipment , training , and protecting our forces in the field . "
lambsdorff also mentioned the dangers of sending troops to the region without the necessary financial backing , saying this could lead to problems for the soldiers like missing or inferior equipment .
he said european nato members had no choice but to act within their limitations .

" we have n't even reached the -lrb- upper limit for troop levels of -rrb- 5,000 yet - we 'll hit that level around at the end of october , when we have finished deploying the second training and protection battalion . "

speaking at the conclusion of the two-day autumn plenary assembly of the german bishops ' conference in the central city of fulda , zollitsch said " the issue of the ... personal , spiritual and sacramental life of our clergy has long been pressing . "
the bishops ' conference was now " taking the initiative toward dialogue that involves itself as well as the diocese , " he said .
" that includes ways to talk about awkward subjects in the area of sexuality , the vow of celibacy or the receiving of the sacrament by divorcees , " he said .
zollitsch also addressed the recent austerity drive initiated by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which he labeled as socially unbalanced .
he said that the government should seek to raise taxes rather than cutting social services such as child benefit payments .
" it 's absolutely necessary that the government deals with this , even if tax increases wo n't be greeted with enthusiasm , " he said .
deal for abuse victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says compensation details will be discussed next week the meeting also confirmed that the german catholic church was ready to pay compensation to victims of clerical sexual abuse , following the disclosure of hundreds of cases that have rocked the church in several european countries and the united states over the last year .
zollitsch said the amount of compensation had yet to be agreed upon , but that " the number of victims who so far asked for financial compensation is very low .
that can change once it is known that there is a kind of financial recognition or assistance . "
" it is difficult to compensate for something like this , " he added .
" but we are ready to contribute financially , in the sense of paying for therapy and also as an admission . "
the german prelate said the details of any compensation deals would be discussed next week at a round table meeting on abuse set up by the government last march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.09.2010 eastern germany is western germany 's trillion euro bet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a paint job was needed in eastern germany german reunification , 20 years underway , has consumed billions of taxpayers ' euros in the more affluent western half of the country .
so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .

for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .

overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .

the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .

that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .

good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .

“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

speaking at the conclusion of the two-day autumn plenary assembly of the german bishops ' conference in the central city of fulda , zollitsch said " the issue of the ... personal , spiritual and sacramental life of our clergy has long been pressing . "
the bishops ' conference was now " taking the initiative toward dialogue that involves itself as well as the diocese , " he said .
" that includes ways to talk about awkward subjects in the area of sexuality , the vow of celibacy or the receiving of the sacrament by divorcees , " he said .
zollitsch also addressed the recent austerity drive initiated by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which he labeled as socially unbalanced .
he said that the government should seek to raise taxes rather than cutting social services such as child benefit payments .
" it 's absolutely necessary that the government deals with this , even if tax increases wo n't be greeted with enthusiasm , " he said .
deal for abuse victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says compensation details will be discussed next week the meeting also confirmed that the german catholic church was ready to pay compensation to victims of clerical sexual abuse , following the disclosure of hundreds of cases that have rocked the church in several european countries and the united states over the last year .
zollitsch said the amount of compensation had yet to be agreed upon , but that " the number of victims who so far asked for financial compensation is very low .
that can change once it is known that there is a kind of financial recognition or assistance . "
" it is difficult to compensate for something like this , " he added .
" but we are ready to contribute financially , in the sense of paying for therapy and also as an admission . "
the german prelate said the details of any compensation deals would be discussed next week at a round table meeting on abuse set up by the government last march .

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan . " one thing is clear , if civil society hadn ’ t pitched in people here would be really in bad shape , " says the retired college principal syeda basheer chandio . pakistani civil society mobilized famous television hosts have also been collecting donations in their shows . " the government is helping the people , we can ’ t say they ’ re not doing anything , " says shahzad , an engineer from hyderabad who has been in the flood-affected regions with his colleague yasir for weeks . " but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .
what can we do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects . " the international community will probably invest billions into pakistan ’ s reconstruction but it would do well to take time to find out how the money can be used most efficiently . author : thomas baerthlein -lrb- hyderabad -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 24.09.2010 scientists warn of possible peril from 2013 solar flare activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this photograph of the sun , taken december 19 , 1973 , by nasa 's skylab 4 , shows one of the most spectacular solar flares ever recorded researchers warn at a london conference that a large-scale solar flare could disrupt satellites in orbit and power stations on earth .
however , not all scientists are convinced of its wide destructive power . earlier this week , scientists attending the electric infrastructure security council conference in london warned that a massive solar flare may trigger global chaos by causing blackouts and wrecking satellite communications . solar flares are large explosions on the surface of the sun , powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy that has built up in the sun 's atmosphere .
they can last just a few seconds or up to an hour , and can occur in smaller intensities as often as several times per day .
the researchers say that this potential disaster could occur within three years , which is when astronomers forecast a peak in the sun 's magnetic energy cycle .
they say that the resulting solar storm could potentially cause geomagnetic mayhem on earth , knocking out electricity grids around the world .
" as that magnetic field gets tangled up it gets more and more energetic , and that leads to an eleven year cycle of activity , " explained chris davis , a scientist on the solar stormwatch project at the british royal observatory , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we 're on a low level of activity at the moment but sunspots are starting to appear again , and spots are the manifestation of this magnetic field poking through the surface of the sun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the expected effects of the 2013 solar flare is that the northern lights will be able to be seen at higher latitudes previous large solar ejection occured in 19th century astronomers say that the current cycle of solar flare activity started around 2001 and they expect it to reach a peak sometime in 2013 .
but what 's different about this peak is that it could be quite devastating .
the coronal mass ejection could release large amounts of matter , intense magnetic fields and other radiation into space .
typically , some scientists say , ejections of this size only occur approximately every 150 years – the last one was in 1859 .
" the world 's skies were bathed in a blood red aurora – the northern and the southern lights , " said stuart clark , a british astronomy journalist and author of " the sun kings " , which details the event and its impact on modern astronomy .
" and at the same time as these lights appeared in the sky , the nineteenth century equivalent of global communications and navigation just completely stopped working . "
in other words , clark explained , compasses spun uselessly and the telegraph – cutting-edge technology at the time – crashed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar flare in 1989 caused the disruption of power plants and transmission stations in quebec , canada solar flares have disrupted power transmission before today , given that the 21st century relies so heavily on other technology like communications and entertainment satellites , the world is more at risk from damage caused by high-energy particles and other disturbances , said avi schnurr , who organized the conference .
he is a former us department of defense analyst , and current executive director of the israel missile defense association , a lobbying organization .
in addition to affecting spacecraft , such magnetic storms can affect power transmission behavior on the earth , because they cause " transformer saturation , " which reduces or distorts voltage .
that could mean the disruption of power plants and transmission stations , which happened in the province of quebec in canada during a solar flare in 1989 . " the electric grids when they go down , they bring with them our capability to produce water and send water to homes , to produce food , communications , medical care .
all the things we depend on . "
schnurr said .
" and if it 's down for months or years , it 's very painful to think what that would mean . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an australian government scientist dismissed schnurr 's claims as ' overstated ' other scientists say threat is ' overstated ' but not all scientists are convinced of this high level of damage that a solar ejection would cause to the earth in 2013 .
in an interview published friday with the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc -rrb- , phil wilkinson , the assistant director of the australian bureau of meteorology 's ionospheric prediction service , said that the claims that this solar maximum would be the most violent in 100 years are " overstated . "
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- going far beyond what 's realistic and could be worrying or concerning for people who do n't really understand the underlying science behind it all , " he said .
" the real message should be that the coming solar maximum period could be equally as hazardous as any other solar maximum . "
he also said that the impact on power grids would be minimal .
" at worst , it 's a regional thing , not a global thing as these reports imply , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author stuart clark says it would be foolish of governments to ignore warnings about solar flares infrastructure could be protected by ' huge surge protectors ' however , schnurr also said that protecting infrastructure both on the ground and in space is a matter of politics and money .
" we do need to get it together for the governments involved to start protecting the electric grids , " he said .
" but it turns out there are fairly simple measures which are well understood now which can be taken .
there are the equivalents of huge surge protectors which need to be put on these different transformers . "
this " equivalent " is known as a residual current device , or rcd , which is used for domestic wiring systems .
these are trip switches installed on electricity transmission lines that break the connection when there 's a sudden voltage increase .
there would be a temporary disruption in power , but the transformers themselves would be protected .
rcds , schnurr explained , are roughly analogous to surge protectors used in ordinary homes to protect electronic devices from overloading .
he also said that the cost of installing such preventive measures is relatively inexpensive to governments – in the united kingdom , it would cost a few hundred million dollars .
but with so many governments slashing their budgets in the united states , europe and around the globe , it 's still not clear whether governments will actually spend money on an event of which the consequences are not predicted with 100 percent certainty .
after all , similar warnings were made over the y2k bug , the massive worldwide computer glitch , that seemed to be overblown .
still , stuart clark said that governments can not afford to ignore these warnings .
" the consequences if this does happen are just unbelievable , " he said .
" the loss of the power grid for years , loss of the ability to perform any kind of finance or electronic transfers or anything like that , if we do n't do anything to protect ourselves now . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 24.09.2010 scientists warn of possible peril from 2013 solar flare activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this photograph of the sun , taken december 19 , 1973 , by nasa 's skylab 4 , shows one of the most spectacular solar flares ever recorded researchers warn at a london conference that a large-scale solar flare could disrupt satellites in orbit and power stations on earth .
however , not all scientists are convinced of its wide destructive power . earlier this week , scientists attending the electric infrastructure security council conference in london warned that a massive solar flare may trigger global chaos by causing blackouts and wrecking satellite communications . solar flares are large explosions on the surface of the sun , powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy that has built up in the sun 's atmosphere .
they can last just a few seconds or up to an hour , and can occur in smaller intensities as often as several times per day .
the researchers say that this potential disaster could occur within three years , which is when astronomers forecast a peak in the sun 's magnetic energy cycle .
they say that the resulting solar storm could potentially cause geomagnetic mayhem on earth , knocking out electricity grids around the world .
" as that magnetic field gets tangled up it gets more and more energetic , and that leads to an eleven year cycle of activity , " explained chris davis , a scientist on the solar stormwatch project at the british royal observatory , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we 're on a low level of activity at the moment but sunspots are starting to appear again , and spots are the manifestation of this magnetic field poking through the surface of the sun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the expected effects of the 2013 solar flare is that the northern lights will be able to be seen at higher latitudes previous large solar ejection occured in 19th century astronomers say that the current cycle of solar flare activity started around 2001 and they expect it to reach a peak sometime in 2013 .
but what 's different about this peak is that it could be quite devastating .
the coronal mass ejection could release large amounts of matter , intense magnetic fields and other radiation into space .
typically , some scientists say , ejections of this size only occur approximately every 150 years – the last one was in 1859 .
" the world 's skies were bathed in a blood red aurora – the northern and the southern lights , " said stuart clark , a british astronomy journalist and author of " the sun kings " , which details the event and its impact on modern astronomy .
" and at the same time as these lights appeared in the sky , the nineteenth century equivalent of global communications and navigation just completely stopped working . "
in other words , clark explained , compasses spun uselessly and the telegraph – cutting-edge technology at the time – crashed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar flare in 1989 caused the disruption of power plants and transmission stations in quebec , canada solar flares have disrupted power transmission before today , given that the 21st century relies so heavily on other technology like communications and entertainment satellites , the world is more at risk from damage caused by high-energy particles and other disturbances , said avi schnurr , who organized the conference .
he is a former us department of defense analyst , and current executive director of the israel missile defense association , a lobbying organization .
in addition to affecting spacecraft , such magnetic storms can affect power transmission behavior on the earth , because they cause " transformer saturation , " which reduces or distorts voltage .
that could mean the disruption of power plants and transmission stations , which happened in the province of quebec in canada during a solar flare in 1989 . " the electric grids when they go down , they bring with them our capability to produce water and send water to homes , to produce food , communications , medical care .
all the things we depend on . "
schnurr said .
" and if it 's down for months or years , it 's very painful to think what that would mean . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an australian government scientist dismissed schnurr 's claims as ' overstated ' other scientists say threat is ' overstated ' but not all scientists are convinced of this high level of damage that a solar ejection would cause to the earth in 2013 .
in an interview published friday with the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc -rrb- , phil wilkinson , the assistant director of the australian bureau of meteorology 's ionospheric prediction service , said that the claims that this solar maximum would be the most violent in 100 years are " overstated . "
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- going far beyond what 's realistic and could be worrying or concerning for people who do n't really understand the underlying science behind it all , " he said .
" the real message should be that the coming solar maximum period could be equally as hazardous as any other solar maximum . "
he also said that the impact on power grids would be minimal .
" at worst , it 's a regional thing , not a global thing as these reports imply , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author stuart clark says it would be foolish of governments to ignore warnings about solar flares infrastructure could be protected by ' huge surge protectors ' however , schnurr also said that protecting infrastructure both on the ground and in space is a matter of politics and money .
" we do need to get it together for the governments involved to start protecting the electric grids , " he said .
" but it turns out there are fairly simple measures which are well understood now which can be taken .
there are the equivalents of huge surge protectors which need to be put on these different transformers . "
this " equivalent " is known as a residual current device , or rcd , which is used for domestic wiring systems .
these are trip switches installed on electricity transmission lines that break the connection when there 's a sudden voltage increase .
there would be a temporary disruption in power , but the transformers themselves would be protected .
rcds , schnurr explained , are roughly analogous to surge protectors used in ordinary homes to protect electronic devices from overloading .
he also said that the cost of installing such preventive measures is relatively inexpensive to governments – in the united kingdom , it would cost a few hundred million dollars .
but with so many governments slashing their budgets in the united states , europe and around the globe , it 's still not clear whether governments will actually spend money on an event of which the consequences are not predicted with 100 percent certainty .
after all , similar warnings were made over the y2k bug , the massive worldwide computer glitch , that seemed to be overblown .
still , stuart clark said that governments can not afford to ignore these warnings .
" the consequences if this does happen are just unbelievable , " he said .
" the loss of the power grid for years , loss of the ability to perform any kind of finance or electronic transfers or anything like that , if we do n't do anything to protect ourselves now . "

8 after two weeks of escalating tension between japan and china , japanese prosecutors have decided to release the chinese captain of a fishing boat involved in a collision near disputed islands in the east china sea . japan responded to china 's increasingly loud threats to react with " further action " by freeing the 41-year-old zhan qixiong , whom the japanese had accused of deliberately ramming two japanese coastguard vessels . the impact on the japanese people and the relationship between japan and china was cited as the main reason for the release . bildunterschrift : one of the disputed islands in the east china sea , claimed by china and japan the prosecutors said that the captain had not committed a " premeditated criminal act but had acted on the spur of the moment " . tense diplomatic row however , this supposedly spontaneous act took place in disputed territory and sparked a diplomatic row of a scale not seen for a long time . japan calls the chain of islands near the scene of the collision senkaku , whereas china calls it diaoyu .
the two countries claim the islets and the oil-rich surrounding area . on friday , the conservative opposition lashed out at the prosecutors ' decision , saying that they had caved in to chinese pressure unnecessarily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of the fishing boat was released on 13 .
sept. but the captain was detained for longer indeed , earlier this week , seiji maehara , the new japanese foreign minister , had made it crystal clear what japan ’ s position was : " the senkaku islands are an integral part of japan and there is no territorial conflict regarding these islands .
the japanese government will continue to be calm about the situation and will act according to japanese law . " as the dispute escalated , however , the two countries came under international pressure to resolve it through dialogue . china warns prosecutors not to take legal action after hearing the captain would be released , beijing once again repeated that any legal action taken against the captain would be " illegal and invalid " . liu jiangyong , an expert in international relations at qinghua university , accused tokyo of incompetence : " ever since coming to power , the democratic party of japan has been pro-american in foreign policy , and in controversial issues such as international law , bilateral problems between the two nations , and how they should be solved , they have no experience and they don ’ t know the rules and proceedings of international politics . " despite loud accusations and threats , in the end , some analysts predicted , the dispute would not come to much , considering the growing importance of sino-japanese trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute led to anti-japan protests in beijing and hong kong economic necessities outweigh spats china is now japan ’ s biggest trading partner .
christian geltinger , who knows both countries well having spent years in qingdao representing the german state of bavaria and now being based in tokyo had a " easy-going attitude . " " there will always be this kind of spat , " he said .
" but the economic necessity to work together is stronger .

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan . " one thing is clear , if civil society hadn ’ t pitched in people here would be really in bad shape , " says the retired college principal syeda basheer chandio . pakistani civil society mobilized famous television hosts have also been collecting donations in their shows . " the government is helping the people , we can ’ t say they ’ re not doing anything , " says shahzad , an engineer from hyderabad who has been in the flood-affected regions with his colleague yasir for weeks . " but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .
what can we do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects . " the international community will probably invest billions into pakistan ’ s reconstruction but it would do well to take time to find out how the money can be used most efficiently . author : thomas baerthlein -lrb- hyderabad -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 24.09.2010 scientists warn of possible peril from 2013 solar flare activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this photograph of the sun , taken december 19 , 1973 , by nasa 's skylab 4 , shows one of the most spectacular solar flares ever recorded researchers warn at a london conference that a large-scale solar flare could disrupt satellites in orbit and power stations on earth .
however , not all scientists are convinced of its wide destructive power . earlier this week , scientists attending the electric infrastructure security council conference in london warned that a massive solar flare may trigger global chaos by causing blackouts and wrecking satellite communications . solar flares are large explosions on the surface of the sun , powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy that has built up in the sun 's atmosphere .
they can last just a few seconds or up to an hour , and can occur in smaller intensities as often as several times per day .
the researchers say that this potential disaster could occur within three years , which is when astronomers forecast a peak in the sun 's magnetic energy cycle .
they say that the resulting solar storm could potentially cause geomagnetic mayhem on earth , knocking out electricity grids around the world .
" as that magnetic field gets tangled up it gets more and more energetic , and that leads to an eleven year cycle of activity , " explained chris davis , a scientist on the solar stormwatch project at the british royal observatory , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we 're on a low level of activity at the moment but sunspots are starting to appear again , and spots are the manifestation of this magnetic field poking through the surface of the sun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the expected effects of the 2013 solar flare is that the northern lights will be able to be seen at higher latitudes previous large solar ejection occured in 19th century astronomers say that the current cycle of solar flare activity started around 2001 and they expect it to reach a peak sometime in 2013 .
but what 's different about this peak is that it could be quite devastating .
the coronal mass ejection could release large amounts of matter , intense magnetic fields and other radiation into space .
typically , some scientists say , ejections of this size only occur approximately every 150 years – the last one was in 1859 .
" the world 's skies were bathed in a blood red aurora – the northern and the southern lights , " said stuart clark , a british astronomy journalist and author of " the sun kings " , which details the event and its impact on modern astronomy .
" and at the same time as these lights appeared in the sky , the nineteenth century equivalent of global communications and navigation just completely stopped working . "
in other words , clark explained , compasses spun uselessly and the telegraph – cutting-edge technology at the time – crashed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar flare in 1989 caused the disruption of power plants and transmission stations in quebec , canada solar flares have disrupted power transmission before today , given that the 21st century relies so heavily on other technology like communications and entertainment satellites , the world is more at risk from damage caused by high-energy particles and other disturbances , said avi schnurr , who organized the conference .
he is a former us department of defense analyst , and current executive director of the israel missile defense association , a lobbying organization .
in addition to affecting spacecraft , such magnetic storms can affect power transmission behavior on the earth , because they cause " transformer saturation , " which reduces or distorts voltage .
that could mean the disruption of power plants and transmission stations , which happened in the province of quebec in canada during a solar flare in 1989 . " the electric grids when they go down , they bring with them our capability to produce water and send water to homes , to produce food , communications , medical care .
all the things we depend on . "
schnurr said .
" and if it 's down for months or years , it 's very painful to think what that would mean . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an australian government scientist dismissed schnurr 's claims as ' overstated ' other scientists say threat is ' overstated ' but not all scientists are convinced of this high level of damage that a solar ejection would cause to the earth in 2013 .
in an interview published friday with the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc -rrb- , phil wilkinson , the assistant director of the australian bureau of meteorology 's ionospheric prediction service , said that the claims that this solar maximum would be the most violent in 100 years are " overstated . "
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- going far beyond what 's realistic and could be worrying or concerning for people who do n't really understand the underlying science behind it all , " he said .
" the real message should be that the coming solar maximum period could be equally as hazardous as any other solar maximum . "
he also said that the impact on power grids would be minimal .
" at worst , it 's a regional thing , not a global thing as these reports imply , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author stuart clark says it would be foolish of governments to ignore warnings about solar flares infrastructure could be protected by ' huge surge protectors ' however , schnurr also said that protecting infrastructure both on the ground and in space is a matter of politics and money .
" we do need to get it together for the governments involved to start protecting the electric grids , " he said .
" but it turns out there are fairly simple measures which are well understood now which can be taken .
there are the equivalents of huge surge protectors which need to be put on these different transformers . "
this " equivalent " is known as a residual current device , or rcd , which is used for domestic wiring systems .
these are trip switches installed on electricity transmission lines that break the connection when there 's a sudden voltage increase .
there would be a temporary disruption in power , but the transformers themselves would be protected .
rcds , schnurr explained , are roughly analogous to surge protectors used in ordinary homes to protect electronic devices from overloading .
he also said that the cost of installing such preventive measures is relatively inexpensive to governments – in the united kingdom , it would cost a few hundred million dollars .
but with so many governments slashing their budgets in the united states , europe and around the globe , it 's still not clear whether governments will actually spend money on an event of which the consequences are not predicted with 100 percent certainty .
after all , similar warnings were made over the y2k bug , the massive worldwide computer glitch , that seemed to be overblown .
still , stuart clark said that governments can not afford to ignore these warnings .
" the consequences if this does happen are just unbelievable , " he said .
" the loss of the power grid for years , loss of the ability to perform any kind of finance or electronic transfers or anything like that , if we do n't do anything to protect ourselves now . "

he is wearing a traditional bhutanese robe .
he has a low voice and he comes across as a modest , well-balanced man who is satisfied with life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutan is close to achieving the un millenium development goals he is the president of the center for bhutan studies .
since 1999 , his research group has been trying to measure the scale of happiness among the bhutanese : gross national happiness -lrb- gnh -rrb- .
but can happiness be measured ? " we do not measure what you call meta-feelings but positive emotional states like generosity and compassion , and the absence of excessive frequency of anger , frustration and jealousy are good indicators of whether people feel happy or not .
we can measure indirectly .
if you are a victim of very frequent anger and frustration , obviously it means that your mental state - for whatever reason - is not pro-happiness . " 72 indicators of happiness karma ura has developed 72 indicators to measure happiness , which he has divided into nine categories - physical well-being , education and good governance are only a few . bhutanese households are given questionnaires to fill out on a regular basis , which karma ura ’ s research group then evaluates . some example questions are : have you ever thought of committing suicide ?
or how often do you experience jealousy ? however , karma ura knows it is more difficult to measure gross national happiness than it is to measure gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
" our method of aggregating various indicators into one single composite gnh measure is not really perfect .
it is just an attempt , an exploration or a work in progress .
over the years , we will see a refinement of this method . " i must mention that happiness is not to be confused with momentary pleasure .
it is more lasting , more durable , more satisfying , a feature of your life .
let ’ s ask ourselves whether we can develop alternative indices of well-being so that we are not misguided into thinking that gdp and economics alone define what is well-being and happiness for us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to measure national happiness , questionaires are distributed to households rethinking values to make a better world does he think that violent conflicts , ecological disasters and economic crises are the result of pursuing the wrong values ? not necessarily , but the concept of gnh can certainly help contribute to a more balanced world . " the western world is rethinking what is a good economy , what is a good life , what is good politics , what is good governance .
there is a fresh enquiry going on around the world .
gnh can be part of the debate and the discourse .
we must harvest and tap into good ideas coming from everywhere – anything that offers a path forward has to be examined . " this week , bhutan ’ s prime minister jigmi thinley addressed the united nations general assembly and suggested adding happiness to the millennium development goals . he left the podium with a smile and received a strong ovation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 24.09.2010 eu defense ministers advocate military cooperation as austerity measure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased cooperation could lead to a european army european union defense ministers have taken a step towards agreeing on intensified military cooperation in the 27-nation bloc at a meeting in belgium .
the move could save billions from national defense budgets . european defense ministers meeting in belgium have discussed the need to step up military and defense cooperation in a bid to cut billions of euros from domestic defense budgets .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was among those who championed the idea of closer cooperation on defense at the meeting in the city of ghent , but acknowledged that any such plan would face significant obstacles .
" we should join our forces more , but we also have to see the hurdles , " guttenberg said .
" these are national hurdles .
in germany , for example , parliament has to agree to every foreign mission .
while that has been a very good thing , it can also be an obstacle in the european context . "
the proposal is that , in the future , eu countries could cut defense budgets in two ways : first , different member states could specialize in different aspects of defense , and second , the bloc could band together in the defense procurement process to secure better deals .
guttenberg has also pushed his own three-step model to help aid such defense cooperation .
the plan would first involve defining those domestic defense capabilities that were absolutely necessary for individual eu member states , then ascertaining the areas in which cooperation could bring savings , and , finally , allocating defense specialties to individual countries , which would then make their defense resources available to other eu members in the case of emergencies .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says eu members could specialize their defense capabilities christian schmidt , parliamentary secretary at the german defense ministry , said on the sidelines of the ministers ' meeting that the pressure on governments to cut costs had " led to the realization that we have a lot of common interests in europe . "
" there is a general consensus that in these current times we can not afford to carry out operations at the same capacity nor as efficiently . "
guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal grouping in the european parliament , went one step further , arguing for a common european army .
" we have now a diplomatic service , which is very important , but we also need the other instrument - a common european defense , a common european army , " he said .
" and certainly , at a time when every european country has to make savings , maybe it 's the right time to build up this common european army .
there are two million soldiers in europe , but only 300,000 in the us , and i think that the american army is more efficient that the european forces .
so that 's a good reason to start this . "
sino-american dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morin says defense cooperation would minimize the influence of the us on europe the french defense minister , herve morin , said that if europe failed to boost defense cooperation , it risked becoming a puppet of the united states and china .
" at the rate we 're going , we risk europe gradually becoming a protectorate - 50 years from now we 'll become a pawn in the balance between the new powers and we 'll be under a joint dominion of china and america , " morin told reporters .
" all the countries of the world are re-arming and the europeans , who already before the crisis had really weak budgets , have now carried out new reductions . "
the french defense minister said eu states should formulate a list of defense capabilities that should remain under the control of individual states and those that should be shared .
also on the agenda at the meeting was the ongoing conflict in afghanistan .
german defense minister guttenberg said germany intended to increase its efforts in training security forces in the country .
he said that as many as 1,600 soldiers could be performing this task by the end of october .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.09.2010 eastern germany is western germany 's trillion euro bet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a paint job was needed in eastern germany german reunification , 20 years underway , has consumed billions of taxpayers ' euros in the more affluent western half of the country .
so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.09.2010 us-vietnam nuclear deal has experts divided großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-vietnam deal can be interpreted as a move to counter chinese influence the united states and vietnam are close to a nuclear deal that would allow hanoi the right to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium .
while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .

" but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.09.2010 us-vietnam nuclear deal has experts divided großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-vietnam deal can be interpreted as a move to counter chinese influence the united states and vietnam are close to a nuclear deal that would allow hanoi the right to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium .
while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan . " one thing is clear , if civil society hadn ’ t pitched in people here would be really in bad shape , " says the retired college principal syeda basheer chandio . pakistani civil society mobilized famous television hosts have also been collecting donations in their shows . " the government is helping the people , we can ’ t say they ’ re not doing anything , " says shahzad , an engineer from hyderabad who has been in the flood-affected regions with his colleague yasir for weeks . " but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .
what can we do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects . " the international community will probably invest billions into pakistan ’ s reconstruction but it would do well to take time to find out how the money can be used most efficiently . author : thomas baerthlein -lrb- hyderabad -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her estranged husband juan carlos lecompte has filed for divorce , citing her infidelity .

now she has released a highly criticized book about it , as john laurenson reports in this postcard from paris . it was a photo that went around the world : ingrid betancourt , frail , pale and thin , her hair down to her waist , her eyes lowered in submission like a latter-day joan of arc .
the snapshot of the french-colombian politician taken by her captors in the middle of the jungle is a moving one , which redoubled the activity of her support groups , especially among politicians , journalists and actors in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farc rebels released this picture of betancourt in captivity betancourt was kidnapped in 2002 by the revolutionary armed forces -lrb- farc -rrb- of colombia while campaigning as a candidate for a political formation called green oxygen to become president of the country .
her memoir " even silence has an end " tells us what happened over the next six-and-a-half years .
there were mosquitoes and snakes , humiliations meted out by her guards .
she writes of her faith that buoyed her up and her wonderment at the beauty of the jungle .
but there was also her collapsing health , malaria and meager diet - the meals of flour and , if she was lucky , monkey meat .
towards the end of her ordeal , her fervent catholic faith abandoned her , causing the steep decline of hope and her gradual slipping towards death .
she describes how , on five occasions , she escaped - only to be stopped by the enormous and hostile jungle and captured again .
and she makes it clear she was sexually abused by her guards .
the book was handwritten , as if , perhaps , she were still denying herself the luxury of a computer in the world of celebrity , wealth and freedom she has returned to .
she told french media that she had intended to write in spanish but ultimately found the experience too painful , and turned to french , the language she was schooled in .
critical voices but reactions by betancourt 's fellow hostages have soured the book 's international release this week .
her presidential running-mate clara rojas has sharply criticized the book , saying it contains " lies and spite . "
rojas had a baby in 2006 while being held captive but , she says , she did not request to have the child in captivity as betancourt claims in her book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's john laurenson reviews betancourt 's moving account " how dare she insinuate something like that without evidence , " rojas said .
in fact , she says , betancourt suggested she should hand her son manuel over to the rebels and forget about him .
other former hostages who spent time in captivity alongside betancourt have also spoken out against her , calling her arrogant .
her estranged husband juan carlos lecompte has filed for divorce , citing her infidelity .
her recent request for millions of dollars in compensation from the colombian government , which she later withdrew , has brought her further disapproval .
nonetheless , " even silence has an end " shows that she is also capable of self-criticism .
" i was n't sensitive enough to understand their despair , " she writes of the other hostages who did not have her celebrity status .
" i saw myself as a symbol that could be useful for all of us .
i did not understand that everyone needs to have a face . "

by 2020 , all participating countries have agreed to switch over to the bachelor and master system . that means students can get a quicker start in the working world and also earn degrees that are more easily compared and evaluated internationally .
the switch to the bachelor and master system is especially important for foreign students interested in studying in germany , since the changes increase the likelihood that degrees earned abroad will be recognized at home . end of the diplom and magister prior to the bologna reform , german university students earned either a diplom -lrb- in scientific and technical areas -rrb- or a magister -lrb- in the humanities and social sciences -rrb- .
students required at least eight semesters - and typically longer - to complete one of the two degrees . well over 80 percent of the programs at german universities now lead to either a bachelor or master .
a bachelor 's degree is generally intended to be completed after six semesters , while a master takes an additional two years . on the other hand , future lawyers , doctors and pharmacists do not earn degrees according to the bologna reform and are still educated in preparation for a state examination conducted at the end of their studies .
however , the process in these fields will also eventually be replaced with some variation of the bachelor and master system . enrollment requirements to apply for an undergraduate degree in germany , applicants must often show they possess certain credentials , like having adequate german skills and good prior educational records .
additionally , some programs require or recommend an internship prior to enrollment , while some arts academies require qualifying tests .
undergraduate degree programs typically lead to a bachelor or qualify the student to take germany 's state examinations in law or in medicine . master 's degrees typically require a bachelor in the same or a closely related field , while phd programs generally seek students that have earned a master with academic distinction in the same field . author : claudia unseld , gaby reucher editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 24.09.2010 scientists warn of possible peril from 2013 solar flare activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this photograph of the sun , taken december 19 , 1973 , by nasa 's skylab 4 , shows one of the most spectacular solar flares ever recorded researchers warn at a london conference that a large-scale solar flare could disrupt satellites in orbit and power stations on earth .
however , not all scientists are convinced of its wide destructive power . earlier this week , scientists attending the electric infrastructure security council conference in london warned that a massive solar flare may trigger global chaos by causing blackouts and wrecking satellite communications . solar flares are large explosions on the surface of the sun , powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy that has built up in the sun 's atmosphere .
they can last just a few seconds or up to an hour , and can occur in smaller intensities as often as several times per day .
the researchers say that this potential disaster could occur within three years , which is when astronomers forecast a peak in the sun 's magnetic energy cycle .
they say that the resulting solar storm could potentially cause geomagnetic mayhem on earth , knocking out electricity grids around the world .
" as that magnetic field gets tangled up it gets more and more energetic , and that leads to an eleven year cycle of activity , " explained chris davis , a scientist on the solar stormwatch project at the british royal observatory , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we 're on a low level of activity at the moment but sunspots are starting to appear again , and spots are the manifestation of this magnetic field poking through the surface of the sun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the expected effects of the 2013 solar flare is that the northern lights will be able to be seen at higher latitudes previous large solar ejection occured in 19th century astronomers say that the current cycle of solar flare activity started around 2001 and they expect it to reach a peak sometime in 2013 .
but what 's different about this peak is that it could be quite devastating .
the coronal mass ejection could release large amounts of matter , intense magnetic fields and other radiation into space .
typically , some scientists say , ejections of this size only occur approximately every 150 years – the last one was in 1859 .
" the world 's skies were bathed in a blood red aurora – the northern and the southern lights , " said stuart clark , a british astronomy journalist and author of " the sun kings " , which details the event and its impact on modern astronomy .
" and at the same time as these lights appeared in the sky , the nineteenth century equivalent of global communications and navigation just completely stopped working . "
in other words , clark explained , compasses spun uselessly and the telegraph – cutting-edge technology at the time – crashed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar flare in 1989 caused the disruption of power plants and transmission stations in quebec , canada solar flares have disrupted power transmission before today , given that the 21st century relies so heavily on other technology like communications and entertainment satellites , the world is more at risk from damage caused by high-energy particles and other disturbances , said avi schnurr , who organized the conference .
he is a former us department of defense analyst , and current executive director of the israel missile defense association , a lobbying organization .
in addition to affecting spacecraft , such magnetic storms can affect power transmission behavior on the earth , because they cause " transformer saturation , " which reduces or distorts voltage .
that could mean the disruption of power plants and transmission stations , which happened in the province of quebec in canada during a solar flare in 1989 . " the electric grids when they go down , they bring with them our capability to produce water and send water to homes , to produce food , communications , medical care .
all the things we depend on . "
schnurr said .
" and if it 's down for months or years , it 's very painful to think what that would mean . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an australian government scientist dismissed schnurr 's claims as ' overstated ' other scientists say threat is ' overstated ' but not all scientists are convinced of this high level of damage that a solar ejection would cause to the earth in 2013 .
in an interview published friday with the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc -rrb- , phil wilkinson , the assistant director of the australian bureau of meteorology 's ionospheric prediction service , said that the claims that this solar maximum would be the most violent in 100 years are " overstated . "
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- going far beyond what 's realistic and could be worrying or concerning for people who do n't really understand the underlying science behind it all , " he said .
" the real message should be that the coming solar maximum period could be equally as hazardous as any other solar maximum . "
he also said that the impact on power grids would be minimal .
" at worst , it 's a regional thing , not a global thing as these reports imply , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author stuart clark says it would be foolish of governments to ignore warnings about solar flares infrastructure could be protected by ' huge surge protectors ' however , schnurr also said that protecting infrastructure both on the ground and in space is a matter of politics and money .
" we do need to get it together for the governments involved to start protecting the electric grids , " he said .
" but it turns out there are fairly simple measures which are well understood now which can be taken .
there are the equivalents of huge surge protectors which need to be put on these different transformers . "
this " equivalent " is known as a residual current device , or rcd , which is used for domestic wiring systems .
these are trip switches installed on electricity transmission lines that break the connection when there 's a sudden voltage increase .
there would be a temporary disruption in power , but the transformers themselves would be protected .
rcds , schnurr explained , are roughly analogous to surge protectors used in ordinary homes to protect electronic devices from overloading .
he also said that the cost of installing such preventive measures is relatively inexpensive to governments – in the united kingdom , it would cost a few hundred million dollars .
but with so many governments slashing their budgets in the united states , europe and around the globe , it 's still not clear whether governments will actually spend money on an event of which the consequences are not predicted with 100 percent certainty .
after all , similar warnings were made over the y2k bug , the massive worldwide computer glitch , that seemed to be overblown .
still , stuart clark said that governments can not afford to ignore these warnings .
" the consequences if this does happen are just unbelievable , " he said .
" the loss of the power grid for years , loss of the ability to perform any kind of finance or electronic transfers or anything like that , if we do n't do anything to protect ourselves now . "

that could mean the disruption of power plants and transmission stations , which happened in the province of quebec in canada during a solar flare in 1989 . " the electric grids when they go down , they bring with them our capability to produce water and send water to homes , to produce food , communications , medical care .
all the things we depend on . "
schnurr said .
" and if it 's down for months or years , it 's very painful to think what that would mean . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an australian government scientist dismissed schnurr 's claims as ' overstated ' other scientists say threat is ' overstated ' but not all scientists are convinced of this high level of damage that a solar ejection would cause to the earth in 2013 .
in an interview published friday with the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc -rrb- , phil wilkinson , the assistant director of the australian bureau of meteorology 's ionospheric prediction service , said that the claims that this solar maximum would be the most violent in 100 years are " overstated . "
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- going far beyond what 's realistic and could be worrying or concerning for people who do n't really understand the underlying science behind it all , " he said .
" the real message should be that the coming solar maximum period could be equally as hazardous as any other solar maximum . "
he also said that the impact on power grids would be minimal .
" at worst , it 's a regional thing , not a global thing as these reports imply , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author stuart clark says it would be foolish of governments to ignore warnings about solar flares infrastructure could be protected by ' huge surge protectors ' however , schnurr also said that protecting infrastructure both on the ground and in space is a matter of politics and money .
" we do need to get it together for the governments involved to start protecting the electric grids , " he said .
" but it turns out there are fairly simple measures which are well understood now which can be taken .
there are the equivalents of huge surge protectors which need to be put on these different transformers . "
this " equivalent " is known as a residual current device , or rcd , which is used for domestic wiring systems .
these are trip switches installed on electricity transmission lines that break the connection when there 's a sudden voltage increase .
there would be a temporary disruption in power , but the transformers themselves would be protected .
rcds , schnurr explained , are roughly analogous to surge protectors used in ordinary homes to protect electronic devices from overloading .
he also said that the cost of installing such preventive measures is relatively inexpensive to governments – in the united kingdom , it would cost a few hundred million dollars .
but with so many governments slashing their budgets in the united states , europe and around the globe , it 's still not clear whether governments will actually spend money on an event of which the consequences are not predicted with 100 percent certainty .
after all , similar warnings were made over the y2k bug , the massive worldwide computer glitch , that seemed to be overblown .
still , stuart clark said that governments can not afford to ignore these warnings .
" the consequences if this does happen are just unbelievable , " he said .
" the loss of the power grid for years , loss of the ability to perform any kind of finance or electronic transfers or anything like that , if we do n't do anything to protect ourselves now . "

but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .

but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .
although the bmz says there are no hard plans to talk about the fund , a representative of the quito administration told deutsche welle that the team would take the opportunity to talk germany through its doubts regarding the initiative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 24.09.2010 german satellite meets fiery end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 years of work up in smoke - but not for nothing after 10 years in orbit and 58277 trips around the earth , the georesearch satellite champ collected material that made for one of the most successful earth observation missions yet , say researchers . it was a quick end to a long life for champ , the challenging mini satellite payload .
after 3718 days of providing information to researchers on the ground , the satellite burnt up on september 19 , 2010 over the sea of okhotsk , somewhere between eastern siberia , the russian peninsular of kamchatka and japan .
it was " one of the most successful observation missions of the earth 's system , " said professor reinhard huettle , ceo of the potsdam-based german research center for geosciences , better known by its german acronym , gfz .
this was the center that first designed the champ project in 1995 .
since then the satellite has provided geoscientists with groundbreaking new insights .
the ' potsdam gravity potato ' the information provided by champ allowed researchers , for instance , to better capture the earth 's form – dips and bulges included .
this allowed researchers to develop an image of earth not as a perfect sphere but as a ' floating potato ' – the ' potsdam gravity potato ' .
bildunterschrift : the ' potato earth ' as seen by champ this was possible because champ was set on an irregular orbit around the earth : at times it was more attracted to the earth , at times less .
for the first time , researchers were able to trace the satellite 's path continuously and accurately , to within centimeters , and were able to reconstruct the shape of the earth second by second .
champ also offered researchers new insights into the earth 's magnetic field , allowing them to recognize that field strength decreases continuously , particularly in the southern atlantic ocean , which in turn leads to frequent disruptions in satellite operation .
what 's more , the satellite allowed for the creation of global maps of important mineral and ore deposits – pointing to iron ore in kursk , russia , and diamonds in west africa – as these deposits could be seen for the first time through analysis of the magnetization of the rock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth 's magnetic field come rain or shine measurements taken by the satellite have also been used in weather forecasting and climate research .
for the first time in 2006 , the british ' met office ' used the satellite 's data to create global weather forecasts .

after 3718 days of providing information to researchers on the ground , the satellite burnt up on september 19 , 2010 over the sea of okhotsk , somewhere between eastern siberia , the russian peninsular of kamchatka and japan .
it was " one of the most successful observation missions of the earth 's system , " said professor reinhard huettle , ceo of the potsdam-based german research center for geosciences , better known by its german acronym , gfz .
this was the center that first designed the champ project in 1995 .
since then the satellite has provided geoscientists with groundbreaking new insights .
the ' potsdam gravity potato ' the information provided by champ allowed researchers , for instance , to better capture the earth 's form – dips and bulges included .
this allowed researchers to develop an image of earth not as a perfect sphere but as a ' floating potato ' – the ' potsdam gravity potato ' .
bildunterschrift : the ' potato earth ' as seen by champ this was possible because champ was set on an irregular orbit around the earth : at times it was more attracted to the earth , at times less .
for the first time , researchers were able to trace the satellite 's path continuously and accurately , to within centimeters , and were able to reconstruct the shape of the earth second by second .
champ also offered researchers new insights into the earth 's magnetic field , allowing them to recognize that field strength decreases continuously , particularly in the southern atlantic ocean , which in turn leads to frequent disruptions in satellite operation .
what 's more , the satellite allowed for the creation of global maps of important mineral and ore deposits – pointing to iron ore in kursk , russia , and diamonds in west africa – as these deposits could be seen for the first time through analysis of the magnetization of the rock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth 's magnetic field come rain or shine measurements taken by the satellite have also been used in weather forecasting and climate research .
for the first time in 2006 , the british ' met office ' used the satellite 's data to create global weather forecasts .
champ data has also been used in centers in europe , japan and canada .
the satellite also proved unexpectedly useful in monitoring space weather , allowing meteorologists to predict storms in the ionosphere , an outer layer of the earth 's atmosphere , more quickly .
these storms can interfere with telecommunications , satellite navigation and radio-radar systems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.09.2010 us-vietnam nuclear deal has experts divided großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-vietnam deal can be interpreted as a move to counter chinese influence the united states and vietnam are close to a nuclear deal that would allow hanoi the right to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium .
while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 24.09.2010 scientists warn of possible peril from 2013 solar flare activity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this photograph of the sun , taken december 19 , 1973 , by nasa 's skylab 4 , shows one of the most spectacular solar flares ever recorded researchers warn at a london conference that a large-scale solar flare could disrupt satellites in orbit and power stations on earth .
however , not all scientists are convinced of its wide destructive power . earlier this week , scientists attending the electric infrastructure security council conference in london warned that a massive solar flare may trigger global chaos by causing blackouts and wrecking satellite communications . solar flares are large explosions on the surface of the sun , powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy that has built up in the sun 's atmosphere .
they can last just a few seconds or up to an hour , and can occur in smaller intensities as often as several times per day .
the researchers say that this potential disaster could occur within three years , which is when astronomers forecast a peak in the sun 's magnetic energy cycle .
they say that the resulting solar storm could potentially cause geomagnetic mayhem on earth , knocking out electricity grids around the world .
" as that magnetic field gets tangled up it gets more and more energetic , and that leads to an eleven year cycle of activity , " explained chris davis , a scientist on the solar stormwatch project at the british royal observatory , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we 're on a low level of activity at the moment but sunspots are starting to appear again , and spots are the manifestation of this magnetic field poking through the surface of the sun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the expected effects of the 2013 solar flare is that the northern lights will be able to be seen at higher latitudes previous large solar ejection occured in 19th century astronomers say that the current cycle of solar flare activity started around 2001 and they expect it to reach a peak sometime in 2013 .
but what 's different about this peak is that it could be quite devastating .
the coronal mass ejection could release large amounts of matter , intense magnetic fields and other radiation into space .
typically , some scientists say , ejections of this size only occur approximately every 150 years – the last one was in 1859 .
" the world 's skies were bathed in a blood red aurora – the northern and the southern lights , " said stuart clark , a british astronomy journalist and author of " the sun kings " , which details the event and its impact on modern astronomy .
" and at the same time as these lights appeared in the sky , the nineteenth century equivalent of global communications and navigation just completely stopped working . "
in other words , clark explained , compasses spun uselessly and the telegraph – cutting-edge technology at the time – crashed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar flare in 1989 caused the disruption of power plants and transmission stations in quebec , canada solar flares have disrupted power transmission before today , given that the 21st century relies so heavily on other technology like communications and entertainment satellites , the world is more at risk from damage caused by high-energy particles and other disturbances , said avi schnurr , who organized the conference .
he is a former us department of defense analyst , and current executive director of the israel missile defense association , a lobbying organization .
in addition to affecting spacecraft , such magnetic storms can affect power transmission behavior on the earth , because they cause " transformer saturation , " which reduces or distorts voltage .
that could mean the disruption of power plants and transmission stations , which happened in the province of quebec in canada during a solar flare in 1989 . " the electric grids when they go down , they bring with them our capability to produce water and send water to homes , to produce food , communications , medical care .
all the things we depend on . "
schnurr said .
" and if it 's down for months or years , it 's very painful to think what that would mean . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an australian government scientist dismissed schnurr 's claims as ' overstated ' other scientists say threat is ' overstated ' but not all scientists are convinced of this high level of damage that a solar ejection would cause to the earth in 2013 .
in an interview published friday with the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc -rrb- , phil wilkinson , the assistant director of the australian bureau of meteorology 's ionospheric prediction service , said that the claims that this solar maximum would be the most violent in 100 years are " overstated . "
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- going far beyond what 's realistic and could be worrying or concerning for people who do n't really understand the underlying science behind it all , " he said .
" the real message should be that the coming solar maximum period could be equally as hazardous as any other solar maximum . "
he also said that the impact on power grids would be minimal .
" at worst , it 's a regional thing , not a global thing as these reports imply , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author stuart clark says it would be foolish of governments to ignore warnings about solar flares infrastructure could be protected by ' huge surge protectors ' however , schnurr also said that protecting infrastructure both on the ground and in space is a matter of politics and money .
" we do need to get it together for the governments involved to start protecting the electric grids , " he said .
" but it turns out there are fairly simple measures which are well understood now which can be taken .
there are the equivalents of huge surge protectors which need to be put on these different transformers . "
this " equivalent " is known as a residual current device , or rcd , which is used for domestic wiring systems .
these are trip switches installed on electricity transmission lines that break the connection when there 's a sudden voltage increase .
there would be a temporary disruption in power , but the transformers themselves would be protected .
rcds , schnurr explained , are roughly analogous to surge protectors used in ordinary homes to protect electronic devices from overloading .
he also said that the cost of installing such preventive measures is relatively inexpensive to governments – in the united kingdom , it would cost a few hundred million dollars .
but with so many governments slashing their budgets in the united states , europe and around the globe , it 's still not clear whether governments will actually spend money on an event of which the consequences are not predicted with 100 percent certainty .
after all , similar warnings were made over the y2k bug , the massive worldwide computer glitch , that seemed to be overblown .
still , stuart clark said that governments can not afford to ignore these warnings .
" the consequences if this does happen are just unbelievable , " he said .
" the loss of the power grid for years , loss of the ability to perform any kind of finance or electronic transfers or anything like that , if we do n't do anything to protect ourselves now . "

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .

" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .

however , that demonstration was dwarfed by earlier marches through the city that attracted tens of thousands of protesters . the stuttgart 21 project aims to completely remodel the city 's train station , as well as transform the state of baden-wuerttemberg into a major hub of european rail transportation .
stuttgart would become part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . baden-wuerttemberg 's state government has said it is prepared to discuss the planning of the project , while stuttgart 21 opponents want to discuss the costs , traffic issues and alternatives to the underground through-station for high-speed trains . earlier attempts at organizing round table talks failed after supporters of the 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- project refused to halt demolition work to the part of the railway station .

speaking at the conclusion of the two-day autumn plenary assembly of the german bishops ' conference in the central city of fulda , zollitsch said " the issue of the ... personal , spiritual and sacramental life of our clergy has long been pressing . "
the bishops ' conference was now " taking the initiative toward dialogue that involves itself as well as the diocese , " he said .
" that includes ways to talk about awkward subjects in the area of sexuality , the vow of celibacy or the receiving of the sacrament by divorcees , " he said .
zollitsch also addressed the recent austerity drive initiated by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which he labeled as socially unbalanced .
he said that the government should seek to raise taxes rather than cutting social services such as child benefit payments .
" it 's absolutely necessary that the government deals with this , even if tax increases wo n't be greeted with enthusiasm , " he said .

zollitsch said the amount of compensation had yet to be agreed upon , but that " the number of victims who so far asked for financial compensation is very low .
that can change once it is known that there is a kind of financial recognition or assistance . "
" it is difficult to compensate for something like this , " he added .
" but we are ready to contribute financially , in the sense of paying for therapy and also as an admission . "
the german prelate said the details of any compensation deals would be discussed next week at a round table meeting on abuse set up by the government last march .

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan . " one thing is clear , if civil society hadn ’ t pitched in people here would be really in bad shape , " says the retired college principal syeda basheer chandio . pakistani civil society mobilized famous television hosts have also been collecting donations in their shows . " the government is helping the people , we can ’ t say they ’ re not doing anything , " says shahzad , an engineer from hyderabad who has been in the flood-affected regions with his colleague yasir for weeks . " but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .
what can we do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects . " the international community will probably invest billions into pakistan ’ s reconstruction but it would do well to take time to find out how the money can be used most efficiently . author : thomas baerthlein -lrb- hyderabad -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.09.2010 us-vietnam nuclear deal has experts divided großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-vietnam deal can be interpreted as a move to counter chinese influence the united states and vietnam are close to a nuclear deal that would allow hanoi the right to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium .
while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

the us wants more european troops in afghanistan , but this could prove a tall order . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg , speaking on the sidelines of an informal meeting with his european counterparts in the northern belgian city of ghent , said that germany intends to increase its efforts training the afghan security forces .
guttenberg said that as many as 1,600 soldiers could be conducting this role by the end of october .
however , the defense minister was also keen to stress that this would not involve committing any more troops to the publicly unpopular afghan mission than the government in berlin had previously promised .
" our mandate is very clearly formulated , and we will stick to it while it is valid , " guttenberg said .
" we have n't even reached the -lrb- upper limit for troop levels of -rrb- 5,000 yet - we 'll hit that level around at the end of october , when we have finished deploying the second training and protection battalion . "
germany 's current mandate for the afghan mission , which is reviewed and renewed each year , allows for an upper limit of 5,000 soldiers and a reserve of 350 ; it expires in february 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is to train afghan forces and let them take over increasing efforts towards training the afghan security forces is part of the overall isaf strategy of mission commander david petraeus .
the ultimate goal is to train and equip a self-sufficient local military and police force , allowing western forces to start withdrawing from the country .
earlier in the week , the us general asked for an extra 2,000 soldiers from washington 's nato partners to this end .
europe reluctant to boost levels nato sources report that european allies feel they can not meet petraeus ' requests .
politically , several countries are unwilling to commit more troops to a mission that 's unpopular among the electorate , and financially , most nato partners feel they do n't have the necessary resources .
" it 's not just germany that 's discussing ways to facilitate more professional and faster cooperation with nato partners on the ground , " defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said , suggesting it might be possible improve efficiency instead of boosting troop levels .
" all our european partners are discussing ways to achieve this , and some are already implementing them , therefore , i see great potential in this direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says germany will stick to its current mandate some european projects along these lines include improving military helicopters in the region , and the shared usage of cargo planes to save resources .
the cost of the military mission is beginning to hurt european countries , many of whom are battling to reduce their public expenditure and national debts .
" europe has more military personnel than the us , we have two million troops in europe , compared to america 's 1.4 million , " german free democrat alexander graf lambsdorff , a member of the european parliament , said .
" yet we spend 200 billion dollars on our armed forces , while the us spends 500 billion .
that means we are still light years behind the us in terms of equipment , training , and protecting our forces in the field . "
lambsdorff also mentioned the dangers of sending troops to the region without the necessary financial backing , saying this could lead to problems for the soldiers like missing or inferior equipment .
he said european nato members had no choice but to act within their limitations .
the eu defense minister meeting in ghent was not expected to yield any fixed resolutions , the informal talks serve as an exchange of experience and ideas .

the us wants more european troops in afghanistan , but this could prove a tall order . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg , speaking on the sidelines of an informal meeting with his european counterparts in the northern belgian city of ghent , said that germany intends to increase its efforts training the afghan security forces .
guttenberg said that as many as 1,600 soldiers could be conducting this role by the end of october .
however , the defense minister was also keen to stress that this would not involve committing any more troops to the publicly unpopular afghan mission than the government in berlin had previously promised .
" our mandate is very clearly formulated , and we will stick to it while it is valid , " guttenberg said .
" we have n't even reached the -lrb- upper limit for troop levels of -rrb- 5,000 yet - we 'll hit that level around at the end of october , when we have finished deploying the second training and protection battalion . "
germany 's current mandate for the afghan mission , which is reviewed and renewed each year , allows for an upper limit of 5,000 soldiers and a reserve of 350 ; it expires in february 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is to train afghan forces and let them take over increasing efforts towards training the afghan security forces is part of the overall isaf strategy of mission commander david petraeus .
the ultimate goal is to train and equip a self-sufficient local military and police force , allowing western forces to start withdrawing from the country .
earlier in the week , the us general asked for an extra 2,000 soldiers from washington 's nato partners to this end .
europe reluctant to boost levels nato sources report that european allies feel they can not meet petraeus ' requests .
politically , several countries are unwilling to commit more troops to a mission that 's unpopular among the electorate , and financially , most nato partners feel they do n't have the necessary resources .
" it 's not just germany that 's discussing ways to facilitate more professional and faster cooperation with nato partners on the ground , " defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said , suggesting it might be possible improve efficiency instead of boosting troop levels .
" all our european partners are discussing ways to achieve this , and some are already implementing them , therefore , i see great potential in this direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says germany will stick to its current mandate some european projects along these lines include improving military helicopters in the region , and the shared usage of cargo planes to save resources .
the cost of the military mission is beginning to hurt european countries , many of whom are battling to reduce their public expenditure and national debts .
" europe has more military personnel than the us , we have two million troops in europe , compared to america 's 1.4 million , " german free democrat alexander graf lambsdorff , a member of the european parliament , said .
" yet we spend 200 billion dollars on our armed forces , while the us spends 500 billion .
that means we are still light years behind the us in terms of equipment , training , and protecting our forces in the field . "
lambsdorff also mentioned the dangers of sending troops to the region without the necessary financial backing , saying this could lead to problems for the soldiers like missing or inferior equipment .
he said european nato members had no choice but to act within their limitations .
the eu defense minister meeting in ghent was not expected to yield any fixed resolutions , the informal talks serve as an exchange of experience and ideas .

there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .
what can we do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects . " the international community will probably invest billions into pakistan ’ s reconstruction but it would do well to take time to find out how the money can be used most efficiently . author : thomas baerthlein -lrb- hyderabad -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , not all scientists are convinced of its wide destructive power . earlier this week , scientists attending the electric infrastructure security council conference in london warned that a massive solar flare may trigger global chaos by causing blackouts and wrecking satellite communications . solar flares are large explosions on the surface of the sun , powered by the sudden release of magnetic energy that has built up in the sun 's atmosphere .
they can last just a few seconds or up to an hour , and can occur in smaller intensities as often as several times per day .
the researchers say that this potential disaster could occur within three years , which is when astronomers forecast a peak in the sun 's magnetic energy cycle .
they say that the resulting solar storm could potentially cause geomagnetic mayhem on earth , knocking out electricity grids around the world .
" as that magnetic field gets tangled up it gets more and more energetic , and that leads to an eleven year cycle of activity , " explained chris davis , a scientist on the solar stormwatch project at the british royal observatory , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we 're on a low level of activity at the moment but sunspots are starting to appear again , and spots are the manifestation of this magnetic field poking through the surface of the sun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the expected effects of the 2013 solar flare is that the northern lights will be able to be seen at higher latitudes previous large solar ejection occured in 19th century astronomers say that the current cycle of solar flare activity started around 2001 and they expect it to reach a peak sometime in 2013 .
but what 's different about this peak is that it could be quite devastating .
the coronal mass ejection could release large amounts of matter , intense magnetic fields and other radiation into space .
typically , some scientists say , ejections of this size only occur approximately every 150 years – the last one was in 1859 .
" the world 's skies were bathed in a blood red aurora – the northern and the southern lights , " said stuart clark , a british astronomy journalist and author of " the sun kings " , which details the event and its impact on modern astronomy .
" and at the same time as these lights appeared in the sky , the nineteenth century equivalent of global communications and navigation just completely stopped working . "
in other words , clark explained , compasses spun uselessly and the telegraph – cutting-edge technology at the time – crashed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a solar flare in 1989 caused the disruption of power plants and transmission stations in quebec , canada solar flares have disrupted power transmission before today , given that the 21st century relies so heavily on other technology like communications and entertainment satellites , the world is more at risk from damage caused by high-energy particles and other disturbances , said avi schnurr , who organized the conference .
he is a former us department of defense analyst , and current executive director of the israel missile defense association , a lobbying organization .
in addition to affecting spacecraft , such magnetic storms can affect power transmission behavior on the earth , because they cause " transformer saturation , " which reduces or distorts voltage .
that could mean the disruption of power plants and transmission stations , which happened in the province of quebec in canada during a solar flare in 1989 . " the electric grids when they go down , they bring with them our capability to produce water and send water to homes , to produce food , communications , medical care .
all the things we depend on . "
schnurr said .
" and if it 's down for months or years , it 's very painful to think what that would mean . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an australian government scientist dismissed schnurr 's claims as ' overstated ' other scientists say threat is ' overstated ' but not all scientists are convinced of this high level of damage that a solar ejection would cause to the earth in 2013 .
in an interview published friday with the australian broadcasting corporation -lrb- abc -rrb- , phil wilkinson , the assistant director of the australian bureau of meteorology 's ionospheric prediction service , said that the claims that this solar maximum would be the most violent in 100 years are " overstated . "
" -lsb- it 's -rsb- going far beyond what 's realistic and could be worrying or concerning for people who do n't really understand the underlying science behind it all , " he said .
" the real message should be that the coming solar maximum period could be equally as hazardous as any other solar maximum . "
he also said that the impact on power grids would be minimal .
" at worst , it 's a regional thing , not a global thing as these reports imply , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author stuart clark says it would be foolish of governments to ignore warnings about solar flares infrastructure could be protected by ' huge surge protectors ' however , schnurr also said that protecting infrastructure both on the ground and in space is a matter of politics and money .
" we do need to get it together for the governments involved to start protecting the electric grids , " he said .
" but it turns out there are fairly simple measures which are well understood now which can be taken .
there are the equivalents of huge surge protectors which need to be put on these different transformers . "
this " equivalent " is known as a residual current device , or rcd , which is used for domestic wiring systems .
these are trip switches installed on electricity transmission lines that break the connection when there 's a sudden voltage increase .
there would be a temporary disruption in power , but the transformers themselves would be protected .
rcds , schnurr explained , are roughly analogous to surge protectors used in ordinary homes to protect electronic devices from overloading .
he also said that the cost of installing such preventive measures is relatively inexpensive to governments – in the united kingdom , it would cost a few hundred million dollars .
but with so many governments slashing their budgets in the united states , europe and around the globe , it 's still not clear whether governments will actually spend money on an event of which the consequences are not predicted with 100 percent certainty .
after all , similar warnings were made over the y2k bug , the massive worldwide computer glitch , that seemed to be overblown .
still , stuart clark said that governments can not afford to ignore these warnings .
" the consequences if this does happen are just unbelievable , " he said .
" the loss of the power grid for years , loss of the ability to perform any kind of finance or electronic transfers or anything like that , if we do n't do anything to protect ourselves now . "

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy secretary chris huhne said the uk was in a unique position to harness wind energy potential world wind leader ?
over the next decade , around 10,000 turbines are expected to become operational around britain 's coasts .
" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .
we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .
critics have questioned the costs and efficiency of the government 's wind energy plans , given their dependency on the variable powers of the wind .

however , that demonstration was dwarfed by earlier marches through the city that attracted tens of thousands of protesters . the stuttgart 21 project aims to completely remodel the city 's train station , as well as transform the state of baden-wuerttemberg into a major hub of european rail transportation .
stuttgart would become part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . baden-wuerttemberg 's state government has said it is prepared to discuss the planning of the project , while stuttgart 21 opponents want to discuss the costs , traffic issues and alternatives to the underground through-station for high-speed trains . earlier attempts at organizing round table talks failed after supporters of the 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- project refused to halt demolition work to the part of the railway station .
opponents have ruled out returning to talks until demolition is halted and a referendum held .

8 after two weeks of escalating tension between japan and china , japanese prosecutors have decided to release the chinese captain of a fishing boat involved in a collision near disputed islands in the east china sea . japan responded to china 's increasingly loud threats to react with " further action " by freeing the 41-year-old zhan qixiong , whom the japanese had accused of deliberately ramming two japanese coastguard vessels . the impact on the japanese people and the relationship between japan and china was cited as the main reason for the release . bildunterschrift : one of the disputed islands in the east china sea , claimed by china and japan the prosecutors said that the captain had not committed a " premeditated criminal act but had acted on the spur of the moment " . tense diplomatic row however , this supposedly spontaneous act took place in disputed territory and sparked a diplomatic row of a scale not seen for a long time . japan calls the chain of islands near the scene of the collision senkaku , whereas china calls it diaoyu .
the two countries claim the islets and the oil-rich surrounding area . on friday , the conservative opposition lashed out at the prosecutors ' decision , saying that they had caved in to chinese pressure unnecessarily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of the fishing boat was released on 13 .
sept. but the captain was detained for longer indeed , earlier this week , seiji maehara , the new japanese foreign minister , had made it crystal clear what japan ’ s position was : " the senkaku islands are an integral part of japan and there is no territorial conflict regarding these islands .
the japanese government will continue to be calm about the situation and will act according to japanese law . " as the dispute escalated , however , the two countries came under international pressure to resolve it through dialogue . china warns prosecutors not to take legal action after hearing the captain would be released , beijing once again repeated that any legal action taken against the captain would be " illegal and invalid " . liu jiangyong , an expert in international relations at qinghua university , accused tokyo of incompetence : " ever since coming to power , the democratic party of japan has been pro-american in foreign policy , and in controversial issues such as international law , bilateral problems between the two nations , and how they should be solved , they have no experience and they don ’ t know the rules and proceedings of international politics . " despite loud accusations and threats , in the end , some analysts predicted , the dispute would not come to much , considering the growing importance of sino-japanese trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute led to anti-japan protests in beijing and hong kong economic necessities outweigh spats china is now japan ’ s biggest trading partner .
christian geltinger , who knows both countries well having spent years in qingdao representing the german state of bavaria and now being based in tokyo had a " easy-going attitude . " " there will always be this kind of spat , " he said .
" but the economic necessity to work together is stronger .
japan has considerably relaxed the entry requirements for chinese travellers and there is a keen desire to exploit the chinese tourist potential in japan .
people already speak good chinese in the stores here and chinese credit cards are accepted .
the real exchange between china and japan has made great progress . " this is a view confirmed by hiroshi tsukamoto , the commissioner general of the japanese pavilion at expo 2010 in shanghai : " we think china is a country of great opportunity .
and shanghai expo is a very good occasion from a business point of view . " some 20,000 chinese visitors a day pop into the japanese pavilion , where they can see what the future bodes by playing with robots or checking out the latest high-tech gadgets . author : anne thomas editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "

but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .
although the bmz says there are no hard plans to talk about the fund , a representative of the quito administration told deutsche welle that the team would take the opportunity to talk germany through its doubts regarding the initiative .

this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .

friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .

8 after two weeks of escalating tension between japan and china , japanese prosecutors have decided to release the chinese captain of a fishing boat involved in a collision near disputed islands in the east china sea . japan responded to china 's increasingly loud threats to react with " further action " by freeing the 41-year-old zhan qixiong , whom the japanese had accused of deliberately ramming two japanese coastguard vessels . the impact on the japanese people and the relationship between japan and china was cited as the main reason for the release . bildunterschrift : one of the disputed islands in the east china sea , claimed by china and japan the prosecutors said that the captain had not committed a " premeditated criminal act but had acted on the spur of the moment " . tense diplomatic row however , this supposedly spontaneous act took place in disputed territory and sparked a diplomatic row of a scale not seen for a long time . japan calls the chain of islands near the scene of the collision senkaku , whereas china calls it diaoyu .
the two countries claim the islets and the oil-rich surrounding area . on friday , the conservative opposition lashed out at the prosecutors ' decision , saying that they had caved in to chinese pressure unnecessarily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of the fishing boat was released on 13 .
sept. but the captain was detained for longer indeed , earlier this week , seiji maehara , the new japanese foreign minister , had made it crystal clear what japan ’ s position was : " the senkaku islands are an integral part of japan and there is no territorial conflict regarding these islands .
the japanese government will continue to be calm about the situation and will act according to japanese law . " as the dispute escalated , however , the two countries came under international pressure to resolve it through dialogue . china warns prosecutors not to take legal action after hearing the captain would be released , beijing once again repeated that any legal action taken against the captain would be " illegal and invalid " . liu jiangyong , an expert in international relations at qinghua university , accused tokyo of incompetence : " ever since coming to power , the democratic party of japan has been pro-american in foreign policy , and in controversial issues such as international law , bilateral problems between the two nations , and how they should be solved , they have no experience and they don ’ t know the rules and proceedings of international politics . " despite loud accusations and threats , in the end , some analysts predicted , the dispute would not come to much , considering the growing importance of sino-japanese trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute led to anti-japan protests in beijing and hong kong economic necessities outweigh spats china is now japan ’ s biggest trading partner .
christian geltinger , who knows both countries well having spent years in qingdao representing the german state of bavaria and now being based in tokyo had a " easy-going attitude . " " there will always be this kind of spat , " he said .
" but the economic necessity to work together is stronger .
japan has considerably relaxed the entry requirements for chinese travellers and there is a keen desire to exploit the chinese tourist potential in japan .
people already speak good chinese in the stores here and chinese credit cards are accepted .
the real exchange between china and japan has made great progress . " this is a view confirmed by hiroshi tsukamoto , the commissioner general of the japanese pavilion at expo 2010 in shanghai : " we think china is a country of great opportunity .
and shanghai expo is a very good occasion from a business point of view . " some 20,000 chinese visitors a day pop into the japanese pavilion , where they can see what the future bodes by playing with robots or checking out the latest high-tech gadgets . author : anne thomas editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it ’ s not only the buildings that look different - the people have changed as well . it occurred to me recently that berlin has acquired some manners .
whereas once upon a time , not all that many years ago , it had a reputation for extreme rudeness , the german capital now manages to elicit accolades of " cool , " " creative , " " open " and most surprisingly , " friendly . "
when i first moved to the city 's former east in 1995 , it was anything but .
such shops as there were did not dispense niceties with their goods ; a smile cost extra and daring to cross the threshold with anything but the correct change in one 's pocket was a crime sometimes severe enough to mean returning home empty-handed .
in restaurants and on public transport the picture was similar .
i recall being served a meal i had not ordered and then being told it was my fault and i should just eat it anyway .
on a bus i was once refused the right to travel because although i had the correct fare , it was comprised of too many small coins for the driver 's taste .
in short , the customer was certainly not the proverbial king .
and then there were the neighbors .
" stop that noise ! " " what noise ? "
my first experience of nachbarn from hell was in a flat in berlin mitte .

talk about a heavy withdrawal . want protection from paper currency devaluations ?
or how about an unforgettable , quick gift ?
consumers in madrid can now use a unique automated teller machine to fetch gold bars of up to 10 grams and coins with custom designs in exchange for cash .
the atm , known as " gold to go , " is the brainchild of thomas geissler .
the german entrepreneur and ceo of ex oriente lux in reutlingen first tested his cash-for-gold vending machine in germany before taking it to consumers with deep pockets and traditional ties to gold in abu dhabi in may .
first atm in the emirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gold atm dispenses bars and coins the first gold atm , located in one of the city 's top hotels , the emirates palace hotel , will be followed over the coming weeks with several more machines in top sites in the united arab emirates .
now gold enthusiasts in europe are on geissler 's radar , too .
spain is among the first of several targeted markets in europe , including austria , germany and switzerland .
in madrid , the gold dispenser is located in the five-star westin palace hotel , a favorite stomping ground for the rich and famous .
soaring demand for gold at first glance , some people could mistake the six-foot tall , gold-leaf-finished machine as some tacky casino attraction .
but the machine is actually packed with some high-tech , including a computer that updates gold prices every 10 minutes , a video surveillance camera and an id scanner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 24.09.2010 berlin lightens up as foreign smiles trump the grumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in just two decades berlin has undergone a major facelift .
but it ’ s not only the buildings that look different - the people have changed as well . it occurred to me recently that berlin has acquired some manners .
whereas once upon a time , not all that many years ago , it had a reputation for extreme rudeness , the german capital now manages to elicit accolades of " cool , " " creative , " " open " and most surprisingly , " friendly . "
when i first moved to the city 's former east in 1995 , it was anything but .
such shops as there were did not dispense niceties with their goods ; a smile cost extra and daring to cross the threshold with anything but the correct change in one 's pocket was a crime sometimes severe enough to mean returning home empty-handed .
in restaurants and on public transport the picture was similar .
i recall being served a meal i had not ordered and then being told it was my fault and i should just eat it anyway .
on a bus i was once refused the right to travel because although i had the correct fare , it was comprised of too many small coins for the driver 's taste .
in short , the customer was certainly not the proverbial king .
and then there were the neighbors .
" stop that noise ! " " what noise ? "
my first experience of nachbarn from hell was in a flat in berlin mitte .
i lived above a couple who kept to themselves - and kept a broomstick close at hand .
whenever the sounds of my quiet , unintrusive day-to-day life became too much for them , they would pound it on their ceiling -lrb- my floor . -rrb-
when i saw them on the stairs they would offer me a " guten tag " begrudging enough to make me consider moving out .
in the end they left before i did , but i have lived above others of their ilk since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more smiling faces in berlin these days ...
i 'm sure such unfathomably grumpy types are not restricted to the bit of berlin that languished behind the wall for so many years , but the fact that they exist here at all stands in stark contrast to the much-told tale of gdr camaraderie .
ask most former citizens of east germany what they liked about it , and they will tell you that necessity drove them into one another 's hearts and homes , and that thus an unbeatable sense of community was born .
or perhaps not .
the fact that during the four decades of its existence more than half a million citizens of the gdr signed up to spy on their friends , neighbors and relatives is a trifling detail that often gets lost on those animated trips down memory lane .
but even if the community spirit was stronger than the rotkaeppchen sparkling wine that was its likely genesis , it did n't make for a friendly city .
illusory good cheer i was talking about this issue with a friend of mine , who was born and grew up in east berlin , the other day .
when i challenged her belief that the capital of old was more friendly than the city in which we both live today , she back-tracked a little to concede that what had passed then for cheerfulness was perhaps just an illusion , born of the same necessity that led to the much-lauded sense of community .
if i am surrounded by the tristesse of gray streets and buildings , she went on , am i really going to be open or well-disposed to others ?
she answered her own question with a succinct " no . "
it would be facile to suggest that a coat of paint is enough to change the fabric of a city , but there is absolutely no doubt that berlin feels more chirpy now than it did when i first got here .
in terms of the service sector , this has much to do with management training and the competitive realities of a consumer society , but they can not explain the new vibe on the street .
there , demographics are at play .
bildunterschrift : ... and grey facades are starting to be replaced by color the past few years have seen an increased influx of both germans from other parts of the country and foreigners who come to berlin because they want to be here and because they want to help shape the place in which they live .
that is not to say that the original east berliners have packed up and left , as many have not .
but they have mixed and mingled to create the " friendly " city that new visitors rave about .
although i personally would n't go so far as to say the modern capital is all about smiles , it has certainly learnt to turn up the corners of its mouth .
at my local supermarket , the cashiers have clearly been taught to ask customers if they have had a successful shopping trip .
the words sound a little odd coming from some of their pursed lips , but i do n't mind because it makes a world of difference .

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy secretary chris huhne said the uk was in a unique position to harness wind energy potential world wind leader ?
over the next decade , around 10,000 turbines are expected to become operational around britain 's coasts .
" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .
we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .
critics have questioned the costs and efficiency of the government 's wind energy plans , given their dependency on the variable powers of the wind .

this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .
prediction : hannover 2-1 last week 's result : 4 points mainz – cologne 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction 0-0 -rrb- hannover – bremen 4-1 -lrb- dw prediction 2-4 -rrb- hoffenheim – bayern 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- leverkusen – frankfurt 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- dortmund – kaiserslautern 5-0 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- hamburg – wolfsburg 1-3 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- moenchengladbach – st. pauli 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 2-0 -rrb- freiburg – schalke 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- nuremberg – stuttgart 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 19 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after 3718 days of providing information to researchers on the ground , the satellite burnt up on september 19 , 2010 over the sea of okhotsk , somewhere between eastern siberia , the russian peninsular of kamchatka and japan .
it was " one of the most successful observation missions of the earth 's system , " said professor reinhard huettle , ceo of the potsdam-based german research center for geosciences , better known by its german acronym , gfz .
this was the center that first designed the champ project in 1995 .
since then the satellite has provided geoscientists with groundbreaking new insights .
the ' potsdam gravity potato ' the information provided by champ allowed researchers , for instance , to better capture the earth 's form – dips and bulges included .
this allowed researchers to develop an image of earth not as a perfect sphere but as a ' floating potato ' – the ' potsdam gravity potato ' .
bildunterschrift : the ' potato earth ' as seen by champ this was possible because champ was set on an irregular orbit around the earth : at times it was more attracted to the earth , at times less .
for the first time , researchers were able to trace the satellite 's path continuously and accurately , to within centimeters , and were able to reconstruct the shape of the earth second by second .
champ also offered researchers new insights into the earth 's magnetic field , allowing them to recognize that field strength decreases continuously , particularly in the southern atlantic ocean , which in turn leads to frequent disruptions in satellite operation .
what 's more , the satellite allowed for the creation of global maps of important mineral and ore deposits – pointing to iron ore in kursk , russia , and diamonds in west africa – as these deposits could be seen for the first time through analysis of the magnetization of the rock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth 's magnetic field come rain or shine measurements taken by the satellite have also been used in weather forecasting and climate research .
for the first time in 2006 , the british ' met office ' used the satellite 's data to create global weather forecasts .
champ data has also been used in centers in europe , japan and canada .
the satellite also proved unexpectedly useful in monitoring space weather , allowing meteorologists to predict storms in the ionosphere , an outer layer of the earth 's atmosphere , more quickly .
these storms can interfere with telecommunications , satellite navigation and radio-radar systems .
15 years of work the champ project began in 1995 when the german education and research ministry developed a satellite mission as a flagship project for the east german space industry , to try to promote existing knowledge of the field within east germany .
five years on , when the 522kg -lrb- 1150lb -rrb- champ satellite was launched , it was originally thought it would stay in orbit for five years at most .
but the satellite 's design allowed it such a stable flight , even at a low flight path , that the mission time could be more than doubled .

this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.09.2010 us-vietnam nuclear deal has experts divided großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-vietnam deal can be interpreted as a move to counter chinese influence the united states and vietnam are close to a nuclear deal that would allow hanoi the right to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium .
while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

now she has released a highly criticized book about it , as john laurenson reports in this postcard from paris . it was a photo that went around the world : ingrid betancourt , frail , pale and thin , her hair down to her waist , her eyes lowered in submission like a latter-day joan of arc .
the snapshot of the french-colombian politician taken by her captors in the middle of the jungle is a moving one , which redoubled the activity of her support groups , especially among politicians , journalists and actors in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farc rebels released this picture of betancourt in captivity betancourt was kidnapped in 2002 by the revolutionary armed forces -lrb- farc -rrb- of colombia while campaigning as a candidate for a political formation called green oxygen to become president of the country .
her memoir " even silence has an end " tells us what happened over the next six-and-a-half years .
there were mosquitoes and snakes , humiliations meted out by her guards .
she writes of her faith that buoyed her up and her wonderment at the beauty of the jungle .
but there was also her collapsing health , malaria and meager diet - the meals of flour and , if she was lucky , monkey meat .
towards the end of her ordeal , her fervent catholic faith abandoned her , causing the steep decline of hope and her gradual slipping towards death .
she describes how , on five occasions , she escaped - only to be stopped by the enormous and hostile jungle and captured again .
and she makes it clear she was sexually abused by her guards .
the book was handwritten , as if , perhaps , she were still denying herself the luxury of a computer in the world of celebrity , wealth and freedom she has returned to .
she told french media that she had intended to write in spanish but ultimately found the experience too painful , and turned to french , the language she was schooled in .
critical voices but reactions by betancourt 's fellow hostages have soured the book 's international release this week .
her presidential running-mate clara rojas has sharply criticized the book , saying it contains " lies and spite . "
rojas had a baby in 2006 while being held captive but , she says , she did not request to have the child in captivity as betancourt claims in her book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's john laurenson reviews betancourt 's moving account " how dare she insinuate something like that without evidence , " rojas said .
in fact , she says , betancourt suggested she should hand her son manuel over to the rebels and forget about him .
other former hostages who spent time in captivity alongside betancourt have also spoken out against her , calling her arrogant .
her estranged husband juan carlos lecompte has filed for divorce , citing her infidelity .
her recent request for millions of dollars in compensation from the colombian government , which she later withdrew , has brought her further disapproval .
nonetheless , " even silence has an end " shows that she is also capable of self-criticism .
" i was n't sensitive enough to understand their despair , " she writes of the other hostages who did not have her celebrity status .
" i saw myself as a symbol that could be useful for all of us .
i did not understand that everyone needs to have a face . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farc rebels released this picture of betancourt in captivity betancourt was kidnapped in 2002 by the revolutionary armed forces -lrb- farc -rrb- of colombia while campaigning as a candidate for a political formation called green oxygen to become president of the country .
her memoir " even silence has an end " tells us what happened over the next six-and-a-half years .
there were mosquitoes and snakes , humiliations meted out by her guards .
she writes of her faith that buoyed her up and her wonderment at the beauty of the jungle .
but there was also her collapsing health , malaria and meager diet - the meals of flour and , if she was lucky , monkey meat .
towards the end of her ordeal , her fervent catholic faith abandoned her , causing the steep decline of hope and her gradual slipping towards death .
she describes how , on five occasions , she escaped - only to be stopped by the enormous and hostile jungle and captured again .
and she makes it clear she was sexually abused by her guards .
the book was handwritten , as if , perhaps , she were still denying herself the luxury of a computer in the world of celebrity , wealth and freedom she has returned to .
she told french media that she had intended to write in spanish but ultimately found the experience too painful , and turned to french , the language she was schooled in .
critical voices but reactions by betancourt 's fellow hostages have soured the book 's international release this week .
her presidential running-mate clara rojas has sharply criticized the book , saying it contains " lies and spite . "
rojas had a baby in 2006 while being held captive but , she says , she did not request to have the child in captivity as betancourt claims in her book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's john laurenson reviews betancourt 's moving account " how dare she insinuate something like that without evidence , " rojas said .
in fact , she says , betancourt suggested she should hand her son manuel over to the rebels and forget about him .
other former hostages who spent time in captivity alongside betancourt have also spoken out against her , calling her arrogant .
her estranged husband juan carlos lecompte has filed for divorce , citing her infidelity .
her recent request for millions of dollars in compensation from the colombian government , which she later withdrew , has brought her further disapproval .
nonetheless , " even silence has an end " shows that she is also capable of self-criticism .
" i was n't sensitive enough to understand their despair , " she writes of the other hostages who did not have her celebrity status .
" i saw myself as a symbol that could be useful for all of us .
i did not understand that everyone needs to have a face . "

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan . " one thing is clear , if civil society hadn ’ t pitched in people here would be really in bad shape , " says the retired college principal syeda basheer chandio . pakistani civil society mobilized famous television hosts have also been collecting donations in their shows . " the government is helping the people , we can ’ t say they ’ re not doing anything , " says shahzad , an engineer from hyderabad who has been in the flood-affected regions with his colleague yasir for weeks . " but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .
what can we do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects .

speaking at the conclusion of the two-day autumn plenary assembly of the german bishops ' conference in the central city of fulda , zollitsch said " the issue of the ... personal , spiritual and sacramental life of our clergy has long been pressing . "
the bishops ' conference was now " taking the initiative toward dialogue that involves itself as well as the diocese , " he said .
" that includes ways to talk about awkward subjects in the area of sexuality , the vow of celibacy or the receiving of the sacrament by divorcees , " he said .
zollitsch also addressed the recent austerity drive initiated by the government of chancellor angela merkel , which he labeled as socially unbalanced .
he said that the government should seek to raise taxes rather than cutting social services such as child benefit payments .
" it 's absolutely necessary that the government deals with this , even if tax increases wo n't be greeted with enthusiasm , " he said .
deal for abuse victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch says compensation details will be discussed next week the meeting also confirmed that the german catholic church was ready to pay compensation to victims of clerical sexual abuse , following the disclosure of hundreds of cases that have rocked the church in several european countries and the united states over the last year .
zollitsch said the amount of compensation had yet to be agreed upon , but that " the number of victims who so far asked for financial compensation is very low .
that can change once it is known that there is a kind of financial recognition or assistance . "
" it is difficult to compensate for something like this , " he added .
" but we are ready to contribute financially , in the sense of paying for therapy and also as an admission . "
the german prelate said the details of any compensation deals would be discussed next week at a round table meeting on abuse set up by the government last march .

the switch to the bachelor and master system is especially important for foreign students interested in studying in germany , since the changes increase the likelihood that degrees earned abroad will be recognized at home . end of the diplom and magister prior to the bologna reform , german university students earned either a diplom -lrb- in scientific and technical areas -rrb- or a magister -lrb- in the humanities and social sciences -rrb- .
students required at least eight semesters - and typically longer - to complete one of the two degrees . well over 80 percent of the programs at german universities now lead to either a bachelor or master .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.09.2010 dw pundits approach bundesliga round six with cautious optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does that look like another goal rush for dortmund to you ?
this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .
prediction : hannover 2-1 last week 's result : 4 points mainz – cologne 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction 0-0 -rrb- hannover – bremen 4-1 -lrb- dw prediction 2-4 -rrb- hoffenheim – bayern 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- leverkusen – frankfurt 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- dortmund – kaiserslautern 5-0 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- hamburg – wolfsburg 1-3 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- moenchengladbach – st. pauli 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 2-0 -rrb- freiburg – schalke 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- nuremberg – stuttgart 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 19 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it ’ s not only the buildings that look different - the people have changed as well . it occurred to me recently that berlin has acquired some manners .
whereas once upon a time , not all that many years ago , it had a reputation for extreme rudeness , the german capital now manages to elicit accolades of " cool , " " creative , " " open " and most surprisingly , " friendly . "
when i first moved to the city 's former east in 1995 , it was anything but .
such shops as there were did not dispense niceties with their goods ; a smile cost extra and daring to cross the threshold with anything but the correct change in one 's pocket was a crime sometimes severe enough to mean returning home empty-handed .
in restaurants and on public transport the picture was similar .
i recall being served a meal i had not ordered and then being told it was my fault and i should just eat it anyway .
on a bus i was once refused the right to travel because although i had the correct fare , it was comprised of too many small coins for the driver 's taste .
in short , the customer was certainly not the proverbial king .
and then there were the neighbors .
" stop that noise ! " " what noise ? "
my first experience of nachbarn from hell was in a flat in berlin mitte .

whenever the sounds of my quiet , unintrusive day-to-day life became too much for them , they would pound it on their ceiling -lrb- my floor . -rrb-

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more smiling faces in berlin these days ...
i 'm sure such unfathomably grumpy types are not restricted to the bit of berlin that languished behind the wall for so many years , but the fact that they exist here at all stands in stark contrast to the much-told tale of gdr camaraderie .
ask most former citizens of east germany what they liked about it , and they will tell you that necessity drove them into one another 's hearts and homes , and that thus an unbeatable sense of community was born .
or perhaps not .
the fact that during the four decades of its existence more than half a million citizens of the gdr signed up to spy on their friends , neighbors and relatives is a trifling detail that often gets lost on those animated trips down memory lane .
but even if the community spirit was stronger than the rotkaeppchen sparkling wine that was its likely genesis , it did n't make for a friendly city .
illusory good cheer i was talking about this issue with a friend of mine , who was born and grew up in east berlin , the other day .
when i challenged her belief that the capital of old was more friendly than the city in which we both live today , she back-tracked a little to concede that what had passed then for cheerfulness was perhaps just an illusion , born of the same necessity that led to the much-lauded sense of community .
if i am surrounded by the tristesse of gray streets and buildings , she went on , am i really going to be open or well-disposed to others ?
she answered her own question with a succinct " no . "
it would be facile to suggest that a coat of paint is enough to change the fabric of a city , but there is absolutely no doubt that berlin feels more chirpy now than it did when i first got here .
in terms of the service sector , this has much to do with management training and the competitive realities of a consumer society , but they can not explain the new vibe on the street .
there , demographics are at play .
bildunterschrift : ... and grey facades are starting to be replaced by color the past few years have seen an increased influx of both germans from other parts of the country and foreigners who come to berlin because they want to be here and because they want to help shape the place in which they live .
that is not to say that the original east berliners have packed up and left , as many have not .
but they have mixed and mingled to create the " friendly " city that new visitors rave about .
although i personally would n't go so far as to say the modern capital is all about smiles , it has certainly learnt to turn up the corners of its mouth .
at my local supermarket , the cashiers have clearly been taught to ask customers if they have had a successful shopping trip .
the words sound a little odd coming from some of their pursed lips , but i do n't mind because it makes a world of difference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.09.2010 dw pundits approach bundesliga round six with cautious optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does that look like another goal rush for dortmund to you ?
this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .

this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 24.09.2010 postcard from europe : betancourt book sparks controversy in france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took betancourt 18 months to write about her captivity former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt spent years as a prisoner in the country 's jungle .
now she has released a highly criticized book about it , as john laurenson reports in this postcard from paris . it was a photo that went around the world : ingrid betancourt , frail , pale and thin , her hair down to her waist , her eyes lowered in submission like a latter-day joan of arc .
the snapshot of the french-colombian politician taken by her captors in the middle of the jungle is a moving one , which redoubled the activity of her support groups , especially among politicians , journalists and actors in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farc rebels released this picture of betancourt in captivity betancourt was kidnapped in 2002 by the revolutionary armed forces -lrb- farc -rrb- of colombia while campaigning as a candidate for a political formation called green oxygen to become president of the country .
her memoir " even silence has an end " tells us what happened over the next six-and-a-half years .
there were mosquitoes and snakes , humiliations meted out by her guards .
she writes of her faith that buoyed her up and her wonderment at the beauty of the jungle .
but there was also her collapsing health , malaria and meager diet - the meals of flour and , if she was lucky , monkey meat .
towards the end of her ordeal , her fervent catholic faith abandoned her , causing the steep decline of hope and her gradual slipping towards death .
she describes how , on five occasions , she escaped - only to be stopped by the enormous and hostile jungle and captured again .
and she makes it clear she was sexually abused by her guards .
the book was handwritten , as if , perhaps , she were still denying herself the luxury of a computer in the world of celebrity , wealth and freedom she has returned to .
she told french media that she had intended to write in spanish but ultimately found the experience too painful , and turned to french , the language she was schooled in .
critical voices but reactions by betancourt 's fellow hostages have soured the book 's international release this week .
her presidential running-mate clara rojas has sharply criticized the book , saying it contains " lies and spite . "
rojas had a baby in 2006 while being held captive but , she says , she did not request to have the child in captivity as betancourt claims in her book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's john laurenson reviews betancourt 's moving account " how dare she insinuate something like that without evidence , " rojas said .
in fact , she says , betancourt suggested she should hand her son manuel over to the rebels and forget about him .
other former hostages who spent time in captivity alongside betancourt have also spoken out against her , calling her arrogant .
her estranged husband juan carlos lecompte has filed for divorce , citing her infidelity .
her recent request for millions of dollars in compensation from the colombian government , which she later withdrew , has brought her further disapproval .
nonetheless , " even silence has an end " shows that she is also capable of self-criticism .
" i was n't sensitive enough to understand their despair , " she writes of the other hostages who did not have her celebrity status .
" i saw myself as a symbol that could be useful for all of us .
i did not understand that everyone needs to have a face . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 24.09.2010 berlin lightens up as foreign smiles trump the grumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in just two decades berlin has undergone a major facelift .
but it ’ s not only the buildings that look different - the people have changed as well . it occurred to me recently that berlin has acquired some manners .
whereas once upon a time , not all that many years ago , it had a reputation for extreme rudeness , the german capital now manages to elicit accolades of " cool , " " creative , " " open " and most surprisingly , " friendly . "
when i first moved to the city 's former east in 1995 , it was anything but .
such shops as there were did not dispense niceties with their goods ; a smile cost extra and daring to cross the threshold with anything but the correct change in one 's pocket was a crime sometimes severe enough to mean returning home empty-handed .
in restaurants and on public transport the picture was similar .
i recall being served a meal i had not ordered and then being told it was my fault and i should just eat it anyway .
on a bus i was once refused the right to travel because although i had the correct fare , it was comprised of too many small coins for the driver 's taste .
in short , the customer was certainly not the proverbial king .
and then there were the neighbors .
" stop that noise ! " " what noise ? "
my first experience of nachbarn from hell was in a flat in berlin mitte .
i lived above a couple who kept to themselves - and kept a broomstick close at hand .
whenever the sounds of my quiet , unintrusive day-to-day life became too much for them , they would pound it on their ceiling -lrb- my floor . -rrb-
when i saw them on the stairs they would offer me a " guten tag " begrudging enough to make me consider moving out .
in the end they left before i did , but i have lived above others of their ilk since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more smiling faces in berlin these days ...
i 'm sure such unfathomably grumpy types are not restricted to the bit of berlin that languished behind the wall for so many years , but the fact that they exist here at all stands in stark contrast to the much-told tale of gdr camaraderie .
ask most former citizens of east germany what they liked about it , and they will tell you that necessity drove them into one another 's hearts and homes , and that thus an unbeatable sense of community was born .
or perhaps not .
the fact that during the four decades of its existence more than half a million citizens of the gdr signed up to spy on their friends , neighbors and relatives is a trifling detail that often gets lost on those animated trips down memory lane .
but even if the community spirit was stronger than the rotkaeppchen sparkling wine that was its likely genesis , it did n't make for a friendly city .
illusory good cheer i was talking about this issue with a friend of mine , who was born and grew up in east berlin , the other day .
when i challenged her belief that the capital of old was more friendly than the city in which we both live today , she back-tracked a little to concede that what had passed then for cheerfulness was perhaps just an illusion , born of the same necessity that led to the much-lauded sense of community .
if i am surrounded by the tristesse of gray streets and buildings , she went on , am i really going to be open or well-disposed to others ?
she answered her own question with a succinct " no . "
it would be facile to suggest that a coat of paint is enough to change the fabric of a city , but there is absolutely no doubt that berlin feels more chirpy now than it did when i first got here .
in terms of the service sector , this has much to do with management training and the competitive realities of a consumer society , but they can not explain the new vibe on the street .
there , demographics are at play .
bildunterschrift : ... and grey facades are starting to be replaced by color the past few years have seen an increased influx of both germans from other parts of the country and foreigners who come to berlin because they want to be here and because they want to help shape the place in which they live .
that is not to say that the original east berliners have packed up and left , as many have not .
but they have mixed and mingled to create the " friendly " city that new visitors rave about .

the fact that during the four decades of its existence more than half a million citizens of the gdr signed up to spy on their friends , neighbors and relatives is a trifling detail that often gets lost on those animated trips down memory lane .

the us wants more european troops in afghanistan , but this could prove a tall order . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg , speaking on the sidelines of an informal meeting with his european counterparts in the northern belgian city of ghent , said that germany intends to increase its efforts training the afghan security forces .
guttenberg said that as many as 1,600 soldiers could be conducting this role by the end of october .
however , the defense minister was also keen to stress that this would not involve committing any more troops to the publicly unpopular afghan mission than the government in berlin had previously promised .
" our mandate is very clearly formulated , and we will stick to it while it is valid , " guttenberg said .
" we have n't even reached the -lrb- upper limit for troop levels of -rrb- 5,000 yet - we 'll hit that level around at the end of october , when we have finished deploying the second training and protection battalion . "
germany 's current mandate for the afghan mission , which is reviewed and renewed each year , allows for an upper limit of 5,000 soldiers and a reserve of 350 ; it expires in february 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is to train afghan forces and let them take over increasing efforts towards training the afghan security forces is part of the overall isaf strategy of mission commander david petraeus .
the ultimate goal is to train and equip a self-sufficient local military and police force , allowing western forces to start withdrawing from the country .
earlier in the week , the us general asked for an extra 2,000 soldiers from washington 's nato partners to this end .
europe reluctant to boost levels nato sources report that european allies feel they can not meet petraeus ' requests .
politically , several countries are unwilling to commit more troops to a mission that 's unpopular among the electorate , and financially , most nato partners feel they do n't have the necessary resources .
" it 's not just germany that 's discussing ways to facilitate more professional and faster cooperation with nato partners on the ground , " defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said , suggesting it might be possible improve efficiency instead of boosting troop levels .
" all our european partners are discussing ways to achieve this , and some are already implementing them , therefore , i see great potential in this direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says germany will stick to its current mandate some european projects along these lines include improving military helicopters in the region , and the shared usage of cargo planes to save resources .
the cost of the military mission is beginning to hurt european countries , many of whom are battling to reduce their public expenditure and national debts .
" europe has more military personnel than the us , we have two million troops in europe , compared to america 's 1.4 million , " german free democrat alexander graf lambsdorff , a member of the european parliament , said .
" yet we spend 200 billion dollars on our armed forces , while the us spends 500 billion .
that means we are still light years behind the us in terms of equipment , training , and protecting our forces in the field . "
lambsdorff also mentioned the dangers of sending troops to the region without the necessary financial backing , saying this could lead to problems for the soldiers like missing or inferior equipment .
he said european nato members had no choice but to act within their limitations .
the eu defense minister meeting in ghent was not expected to yield any fixed resolutions , the informal talks serve as an exchange of experience and ideas .

" we have n't even reached the -lrb- upper limit for troop levels of -rrb- 5,000 yet - we 'll hit that level around at the end of october , when we have finished deploying the second training and protection battalion . "
germany 's current mandate for the afghan mission , which is reviewed and renewed each year , allows for an upper limit of 5,000 soldiers and a reserve of 350 ; it expires in february 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is to train afghan forces and let them take over increasing efforts towards training the afghan security forces is part of the overall isaf strategy of mission commander david petraeus .
the ultimate goal is to train and equip a self-sufficient local military and police force , allowing western forces to start withdrawing from the country .
earlier in the week , the us general asked for an extra 2,000 soldiers from washington 's nato partners to this end .
europe reluctant to boost levels nato sources report that european allies feel they can not meet petraeus ' requests .
politically , several countries are unwilling to commit more troops to a mission that 's unpopular among the electorate , and financially , most nato partners feel they do n't have the necessary resources .
" it 's not just germany that 's discussing ways to facilitate more professional and faster cooperation with nato partners on the ground , " defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said , suggesting it might be possible improve efficiency instead of boosting troop levels .
" all our european partners are discussing ways to achieve this , and some are already implementing them , therefore , i see great potential in this direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says germany will stick to its current mandate some european projects along these lines include improving military helicopters in the region , and the shared usage of cargo planes to save resources .
the cost of the military mission is beginning to hurt european countries , many of whom are battling to reduce their public expenditure and national debts .
" europe has more military personnel than the us , we have two million troops in europe , compared to america 's 1.4 million , " german free democrat alexander graf lambsdorff , a member of the european parliament , said .
" yet we spend 200 billion dollars on our armed forces , while the us spends 500 billion .
that means we are still light years behind the us in terms of equipment , training , and protecting our forces in the field . "
lambsdorff also mentioned the dangers of sending troops to the region without the necessary financial backing , saying this could lead to problems for the soldiers like missing or inferior equipment .
he said european nato members had no choice but to act within their limitations .
the eu defense minister meeting in ghent was not expected to yield any fixed resolutions , the informal talks serve as an exchange of experience and ideas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.09.2010 germany voices reservations about ecuador 's oil fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sight the yasuni itt fund wants to prevent when ecuador first mooted the idea of foregoing massive oil reserves under the yasuni national park in exchange for donations worth half its value , berlin was on board .
but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .
although the bmz says there are no hard plans to talk about the fund , a representative of the quito administration told deutsche welle that the team would take the opportunity to talk germany through its doubts regarding the initiative .

but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 24.09.2010 berlin lightens up as foreign smiles trump the grumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in just two decades berlin has undergone a major facelift .
but it ’ s not only the buildings that look different - the people have changed as well . it occurred to me recently that berlin has acquired some manners .
whereas once upon a time , not all that many years ago , it had a reputation for extreme rudeness , the german capital now manages to elicit accolades of " cool , " " creative , " " open " and most surprisingly , " friendly . "
when i first moved to the city 's former east in 1995 , it was anything but .
such shops as there were did not dispense niceties with their goods ; a smile cost extra and daring to cross the threshold with anything but the correct change in one 's pocket was a crime sometimes severe enough to mean returning home empty-handed .
in restaurants and on public transport the picture was similar .
i recall being served a meal i had not ordered and then being told it was my fault and i should just eat it anyway .
on a bus i was once refused the right to travel because although i had the correct fare , it was comprised of too many small coins for the driver 's taste .
in short , the customer was certainly not the proverbial king .
and then there were the neighbors .
" stop that noise ! " " what noise ? "
my first experience of nachbarn from hell was in a flat in berlin mitte .
i lived above a couple who kept to themselves - and kept a broomstick close at hand .
whenever the sounds of my quiet , unintrusive day-to-day life became too much for them , they would pound it on their ceiling -lrb- my floor . -rrb-
when i saw them on the stairs they would offer me a " guten tag " begrudging enough to make me consider moving out .
in the end they left before i did , but i have lived above others of their ilk since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more smiling faces in berlin these days ...
i 'm sure such unfathomably grumpy types are not restricted to the bit of berlin that languished behind the wall for so many years , but the fact that they exist here at all stands in stark contrast to the much-told tale of gdr camaraderie .
ask most former citizens of east germany what they liked about it , and they will tell you that necessity drove them into one another 's hearts and homes , and that thus an unbeatable sense of community was born .
or perhaps not .
the fact that during the four decades of its existence more than half a million citizens of the gdr signed up to spy on their friends , neighbors and relatives is a trifling detail that often gets lost on those animated trips down memory lane .
but even if the community spirit was stronger than the rotkaeppchen sparkling wine that was its likely genesis , it did n't make for a friendly city .
illusory good cheer i was talking about this issue with a friend of mine , who was born and grew up in east berlin , the other day .
when i challenged her belief that the capital of old was more friendly than the city in which we both live today , she back-tracked a little to concede that what had passed then for cheerfulness was perhaps just an illusion , born of the same necessity that led to the much-lauded sense of community .
if i am surrounded by the tristesse of gray streets and buildings , she went on , am i really going to be open or well-disposed to others ?
she answered her own question with a succinct " no . "
it would be facile to suggest that a coat of paint is enough to change the fabric of a city , but there is absolutely no doubt that berlin feels more chirpy now than it did when i first got here .
in terms of the service sector , this has much to do with management training and the competitive realities of a consumer society , but they can not explain the new vibe on the street .
there , demographics are at play .
bildunterschrift : ... and grey facades are starting to be replaced by color the past few years have seen an increased influx of both germans from other parts of the country and foreigners who come to berlin because they want to be here and because they want to help shape the place in which they live .
that is not to say that the original east berliners have packed up and left , as many have not .
but they have mixed and mingled to create the " friendly " city that new visitors rave about .
although i personally would n't go so far as to say the modern capital is all about smiles , it has certainly learnt to turn up the corners of its mouth .
at my local supermarket , the cashiers have clearly been taught to ask customers if they have had a successful shopping trip .
the words sound a little odd coming from some of their pursed lips , but i do n't mind because it makes a world of difference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.09.2010 germany voices reservations about ecuador 's oil fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sight the yasuni itt fund wants to prevent when ecuador first mooted the idea of foregoing massive oil reserves under the yasuni national park in exchange for donations worth half its value , berlin was on board .
but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .
although the bmz says there are no hard plans to talk about the fund , a representative of the quito administration told deutsche welle that the team would take the opportunity to talk germany through its doubts regarding the initiative .

but it ’ s not only the buildings that look different - the people have changed as well . it occurred to me recently that berlin has acquired some manners .
whereas once upon a time , not all that many years ago , it had a reputation for extreme rudeness , the german capital now manages to elicit accolades of " cool , " " creative , " " open " and most surprisingly , " friendly . "
when i first moved to the city 's former east in 1995 , it was anything but .
such shops as there were did not dispense niceties with their goods ; a smile cost extra and daring to cross the threshold with anything but the correct change in one 's pocket was a crime sometimes severe enough to mean returning home empty-handed .
in restaurants and on public transport the picture was similar .
i recall being served a meal i had not ordered and then being told it was my fault and i should just eat it anyway .
on a bus i was once refused the right to travel because although i had the correct fare , it was comprised of too many small coins for the driver 's taste .
in short , the customer was certainly not the proverbial king .
and then there were the neighbors .
" stop that noise ! " " what noise ? "
my first experience of nachbarn from hell was in a flat in berlin mitte .
i lived above a couple who kept to themselves - and kept a broomstick close at hand .
whenever the sounds of my quiet , unintrusive day-to-day life became too much for them , they would pound it on their ceiling -lrb- my floor . -rrb-
when i saw them on the stairs they would offer me a " guten tag " begrudging enough to make me consider moving out .
in the end they left before i did , but i have lived above others of their ilk since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more smiling faces in berlin these days ...
i 'm sure such unfathomably grumpy types are not restricted to the bit of berlin that languished behind the wall for so many years , but the fact that they exist here at all stands in stark contrast to the much-told tale of gdr camaraderie .
ask most former citizens of east germany what they liked about it , and they will tell you that necessity drove them into one another 's hearts and homes , and that thus an unbeatable sense of community was born .
or perhaps not .
the fact that during the four decades of its existence more than half a million citizens of the gdr signed up to spy on their friends , neighbors and relatives is a trifling detail that often gets lost on those animated trips down memory lane .
but even if the community spirit was stronger than the rotkaeppchen sparkling wine that was its likely genesis , it did n't make for a friendly city .
illusory good cheer i was talking about this issue with a friend of mine , who was born and grew up in east berlin , the other day .
when i challenged her belief that the capital of old was more friendly than the city in which we both live today , she back-tracked a little to concede that what had passed then for cheerfulness was perhaps just an illusion , born of the same necessity that led to the much-lauded sense of community .
if i am surrounded by the tristesse of gray streets and buildings , she went on , am i really going to be open or well-disposed to others ?
she answered her own question with a succinct " no . "
it would be facile to suggest that a coat of paint is enough to change the fabric of a city , but there is absolutely no doubt that berlin feels more chirpy now than it did when i first got here .
in terms of the service sector , this has much to do with management training and the competitive realities of a consumer society , but they can not explain the new vibe on the street .
there , demographics are at play .
bildunterschrift : ... and grey facades are starting to be replaced by color the past few years have seen an increased influx of both germans from other parts of the country and foreigners who come to berlin because they want to be here and because they want to help shape the place in which they live .
that is not to say that the original east berliners have packed up and left , as many have not .
but they have mixed and mingled to create the " friendly " city that new visitors rave about .
although i personally would n't go so far as to say the modern capital is all about smiles , it has certainly learnt to turn up the corners of its mouth .
at my local supermarket , the cashiers have clearly been taught to ask customers if they have had a successful shopping trip .
the words sound a little odd coming from some of their pursed lips , but i do n't mind because it makes a world of difference .

after 3718 days of providing information to researchers on the ground , the satellite burnt up on september 19 , 2010 over the sea of okhotsk , somewhere between eastern siberia , the russian peninsular of kamchatka and japan .
it was " one of the most successful observation missions of the earth 's system , " said professor reinhard huettle , ceo of the potsdam-based german research center for geosciences , better known by its german acronym , gfz .
this was the center that first designed the champ project in 1995 .
since then the satellite has provided geoscientists with groundbreaking new insights .
the ' potsdam gravity potato ' the information provided by champ allowed researchers , for instance , to better capture the earth 's form – dips and bulges included .
this allowed researchers to develop an image of earth not as a perfect sphere but as a ' floating potato ' – the ' potsdam gravity potato ' .
bildunterschrift : the ' potato earth ' as seen by champ this was possible because champ was set on an irregular orbit around the earth : at times it was more attracted to the earth , at times less .
for the first time , researchers were able to trace the satellite 's path continuously and accurately , to within centimeters , and were able to reconstruct the shape of the earth second by second .
champ also offered researchers new insights into the earth 's magnetic field , allowing them to recognize that field strength decreases continuously , particularly in the southern atlantic ocean , which in turn leads to frequent disruptions in satellite operation .
what 's more , the satellite allowed for the creation of global maps of important mineral and ore deposits – pointing to iron ore in kursk , russia , and diamonds in west africa – as these deposits could be seen for the first time through analysis of the magnetization of the rock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth 's magnetic field come rain or shine measurements taken by the satellite have also been used in weather forecasting and climate research .
for the first time in 2006 , the british ' met office ' used the satellite 's data to create global weather forecasts .
champ data has also been used in centers in europe , japan and canada .
the satellite also proved unexpectedly useful in monitoring space weather , allowing meteorologists to predict storms in the ionosphere , an outer layer of the earth 's atmosphere , more quickly .
these storms can interfere with telecommunications , satellite navigation and radio-radar systems .
15 years of work the champ project began in 1995 when the german education and research ministry developed a satellite mission as a flagship project for the east german space industry , to try to promote existing knowledge of the field within east germany .
five years on , when the 522kg -lrb- 1150lb -rrb- champ satellite was launched , it was originally thought it would stay in orbit for five years at most .
but the satellite 's design allowed it such a stable flight , even at a low flight path , that the mission time could be more than doubled .

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .

over the next decade , around 10,000 turbines are expected to become operational around britain 's coasts .
" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .
we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .
critics have questioned the costs and efficiency of the government 's wind energy plans , given their dependency on the variable powers of the wind .

this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .
prediction : hannover 2-1 last week 's result : 4 points mainz – cologne 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction 0-0 -rrb- hannover – bremen 4-1 -lrb- dw prediction 2-4 -rrb- hoffenheim – bayern 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- leverkusen – frankfurt 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- dortmund – kaiserslautern 5-0 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- hamburg – wolfsburg 1-3 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- moenchengladbach – st. pauli 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 2-0 -rrb- freiburg – schalke 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- nuremberg – stuttgart 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 19 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .
prediction : hannover 2-1 last week 's result : 4 points mainz – cologne 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction 0-0 -rrb- hannover – bremen 4-1 -lrb- dw prediction 2-4 -rrb- hoffenheim – bayern 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- leverkusen – frankfurt 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- dortmund – kaiserslautern 5-0 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- hamburg – wolfsburg 1-3 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- moenchengladbach – st. pauli 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 2-0 -rrb- freiburg – schalke 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- nuremberg – stuttgart 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 19 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now she has released a highly criticized book about it , as john laurenson reports in this postcard from paris . it was a photo that went around the world : ingrid betancourt , frail , pale and thin , her hair down to her waist , her eyes lowered in submission like a latter-day joan of arc .
the snapshot of the french-colombian politician taken by her captors in the middle of the jungle is a moving one , which redoubled the activity of her support groups , especially among politicians , journalists and actors in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farc rebels released this picture of betancourt in captivity betancourt was kidnapped in 2002 by the revolutionary armed forces -lrb- farc -rrb- of colombia while campaigning as a candidate for a political formation called green oxygen to become president of the country .
her memoir " even silence has an end " tells us what happened over the next six-and-a-half years .
there were mosquitoes and snakes , humiliations meted out by her guards .
she writes of her faith that buoyed her up and her wonderment at the beauty of the jungle .
but there was also her collapsing health , malaria and meager diet - the meals of flour and , if she was lucky , monkey meat .
towards the end of her ordeal , her fervent catholic faith abandoned her , causing the steep decline of hope and her gradual slipping towards death .
she describes how , on five occasions , she escaped - only to be stopped by the enormous and hostile jungle and captured again .
and she makes it clear she was sexually abused by her guards .
the book was handwritten , as if , perhaps , she were still denying herself the luxury of a computer in the world of celebrity , wealth and freedom she has returned to .
she told french media that she had intended to write in spanish but ultimately found the experience too painful , and turned to french , the language she was schooled in .
critical voices but reactions by betancourt 's fellow hostages have soured the book 's international release this week .
her presidential running-mate clara rojas has sharply criticized the book , saying it contains " lies and spite . "
rojas had a baby in 2006 while being held captive but , she says , she did not request to have the child in captivity as betancourt claims in her book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's john laurenson reviews betancourt 's moving account " how dare she insinuate something like that without evidence , " rojas said .
in fact , she says , betancourt suggested she should hand her son manuel over to the rebels and forget about him .
other former hostages who spent time in captivity alongside betancourt have also spoken out against her , calling her arrogant .
her estranged husband juan carlos lecompte has filed for divorce , citing her infidelity .
her recent request for millions of dollars in compensation from the colombian government , which she later withdrew , has brought her further disapproval .
nonetheless , " even silence has an end " shows that she is also capable of self-criticism .
" i was n't sensitive enough to understand their despair , " she writes of the other hostages who did not have her celebrity status .
" i saw myself as a symbol that could be useful for all of us .
i did not understand that everyone needs to have a face . "

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy secretary chris huhne said the uk was in a unique position to harness wind energy potential world wind leader ?
over the next decade , around 10,000 turbines are expected to become operational around britain 's coasts .
" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .
we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .
critics have questioned the costs and efficiency of the government 's wind energy plans , given their dependency on the variable powers of the wind .

but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .

" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other parts of the yasuni park have already fallen victim to oil exploitation the government has set a deadline of the end of 2011 for the collection of the first installment of funds .
if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "

however , that demonstration was dwarfed by earlier marches through the city that attracted tens of thousands of protesters . the stuttgart 21 project aims to completely remodel the city 's train station , as well as transform the state of baden-wuerttemberg into a major hub of european rail transportation .
stuttgart would become part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . baden-wuerttemberg 's state government has said it is prepared to discuss the planning of the project , while stuttgart 21 opponents want to discuss the costs , traffic issues and alternatives to the underground through-station for high-speed trains . earlier attempts at organizing round table talks failed after supporters of the 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- project refused to halt demolition work to the part of the railway station .
opponents have ruled out returning to talks until demolition is halted and a referendum held .

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy secretary chris huhne said the uk was in a unique position to harness wind energy potential world wind leader ?
over the next decade , around 10,000 turbines are expected to become operational around britain 's coasts .
" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .
we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .
critics have questioned the costs and efficiency of the government 's wind energy plans , given their dependency on the variable powers of the wind .

after 3718 days of providing information to researchers on the ground , the satellite burnt up on september 19 , 2010 over the sea of okhotsk , somewhere between eastern siberia , the russian peninsular of kamchatka and japan .
it was " one of the most successful observation missions of the earth 's system , " said professor reinhard huettle , ceo of the potsdam-based german research center for geosciences , better known by its german acronym , gfz .
this was the center that first designed the champ project in 1995 .
since then the satellite has provided geoscientists with groundbreaking new insights .
the ' potsdam gravity potato ' the information provided by champ allowed researchers , for instance , to better capture the earth 's form – dips and bulges included .
this allowed researchers to develop an image of earth not as a perfect sphere but as a ' floating potato ' – the ' potsdam gravity potato ' .
bildunterschrift : the ' potato earth ' as seen by champ this was possible because champ was set on an irregular orbit around the earth : at times it was more attracted to the earth , at times less .
for the first time , researchers were able to trace the satellite 's path continuously and accurately , to within centimeters , and were able to reconstruct the shape of the earth second by second .
champ also offered researchers new insights into the earth 's magnetic field , allowing them to recognize that field strength decreases continuously , particularly in the southern atlantic ocean , which in turn leads to frequent disruptions in satellite operation .
what 's more , the satellite allowed for the creation of global maps of important mineral and ore deposits – pointing to iron ore in kursk , russia , and diamonds in west africa – as these deposits could be seen for the first time through analysis of the magnetization of the rock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth 's magnetic field come rain or shine measurements taken by the satellite have also been used in weather forecasting and climate research .
for the first time in 2006 , the british ' met office ' used the satellite 's data to create global weather forecasts .
champ data has also been used in centers in europe , japan and canada .
the satellite also proved unexpectedly useful in monitoring space weather , allowing meteorologists to predict storms in the ionosphere , an outer layer of the earth 's atmosphere , more quickly .
these storms can interfere with telecommunications , satellite navigation and radio-radar systems .
15 years of work the champ project began in 1995 when the german education and research ministry developed a satellite mission as a flagship project for the east german space industry , to try to promote existing knowledge of the field within east germany .
five years on , when the 522kg -lrb- 1150lb -rrb- champ satellite was launched , it was originally thought it would stay in orbit for five years at most .
but the satellite 's design allowed it such a stable flight , even at a low flight path , that the mission time could be more than doubled .

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy secretary chris huhne said the uk was in a unique position to harness wind energy potential world wind leader ?
over the next decade , around 10,000 turbines are expected to become operational around britain 's coasts .
" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .
we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .
critics have questioned the costs and efficiency of the government 's wind energy plans , given their dependency on the variable powers of the wind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 24.09.2010 eu defense ministers discuss afghanistan amid us calls for more troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is gradually boosting its military presence afghanistan was top of the agenda as eu defense ministers gathered in the belgian city of ghent for an informal meeting on friday .
the us wants more european troops in afghanistan , but this could prove a tall order . german defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg , speaking on the sidelines of an informal meeting with his european counterparts in the northern belgian city of ghent , said that germany intends to increase its efforts training the afghan security forces .
guttenberg said that as many as 1,600 soldiers could be conducting this role by the end of october .
however , the defense minister was also keen to stress that this would not involve committing any more troops to the publicly unpopular afghan mission than the government in berlin had previously promised .
" our mandate is very clearly formulated , and we will stick to it while it is valid , " guttenberg said .
" we have n't even reached the -lrb- upper limit for troop levels of -rrb- 5,000 yet - we 'll hit that level around at the end of october , when we have finished deploying the second training and protection battalion . "
germany 's current mandate for the afghan mission , which is reviewed and renewed each year , allows for an upper limit of 5,000 soldiers and a reserve of 350 ; it expires in february 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is to train afghan forces and let them take over increasing efforts towards training the afghan security forces is part of the overall isaf strategy of mission commander david petraeus .
the ultimate goal is to train and equip a self-sufficient local military and police force , allowing western forces to start withdrawing from the country .
earlier in the week , the us general asked for an extra 2,000 soldiers from washington 's nato partners to this end .
europe reluctant to boost levels nato sources report that european allies feel they can not meet petraeus ' requests .
politically , several countries are unwilling to commit more troops to a mission that 's unpopular among the electorate , and financially , most nato partners feel they do n't have the necessary resources .
" it 's not just germany that 's discussing ways to facilitate more professional and faster cooperation with nato partners on the ground , " defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg said , suggesting it might be possible improve efficiency instead of boosting troop levels .
" all our european partners are discussing ways to achieve this , and some are already implementing them , therefore , i see great potential in this direction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says germany will stick to its current mandate some european projects along these lines include improving military helicopters in the region , and the shared usage of cargo planes to save resources .
the cost of the military mission is beginning to hurt european countries , many of whom are battling to reduce their public expenditure and national debts .
" europe has more military personnel than the us , we have two million troops in europe , compared to america 's 1.4 million , " german free democrat alexander graf lambsdorff , a member of the european parliament , said .
" yet we spend 200 billion dollars on our armed forces , while the us spends 500 billion .
that means we are still light years behind the us in terms of equipment , training , and protecting our forces in the field . "
lambsdorff also mentioned the dangers of sending troops to the region without the necessary financial backing , saying this could lead to problems for the soldiers like missing or inferior equipment .
he said european nato members had no choice but to act within their limitations .
the eu defense minister meeting in ghent was not expected to yield any fixed resolutions , the informal talks serve as an exchange of experience and ideas .

this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

the snapshot of the french-colombian politician taken by her captors in the middle of the jungle is a moving one , which redoubled the activity of her support groups , especially among politicians , journalists and actors in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farc rebels released this picture of betancourt in captivity betancourt was kidnapped in 2002 by the revolutionary armed forces -lrb- farc -rrb- of colombia while campaigning as a candidate for a political formation called green oxygen to become president of the country .
her memoir " even silence has an end " tells us what happened over the next six-and-a-half years .
there were mosquitoes and snakes , humiliations meted out by her guards .
she writes of her faith that buoyed her up and her wonderment at the beauty of the jungle .
but there was also her collapsing health , malaria and meager diet - the meals of flour and , if she was lucky , monkey meat .
towards the end of her ordeal , her fervent catholic faith abandoned her , causing the steep decline of hope and her gradual slipping towards death .
she describes how , on five occasions , she escaped - only to be stopped by the enormous and hostile jungle and captured again .
and she makes it clear she was sexually abused by her guards .
the book was handwritten , as if , perhaps , she were still denying herself the luxury of a computer in the world of celebrity , wealth and freedom she has returned to .
she told french media that she had intended to write in spanish but ultimately found the experience too painful , and turned to french , the language she was schooled in .
critical voices but reactions by betancourt 's fellow hostages have soured the book 's international release this week .
her presidential running-mate clara rojas has sharply criticized the book , saying it contains " lies and spite . "
rojas had a baby in 2006 while being held captive but , she says , she did not request to have the child in captivity as betancourt claims in her book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's john laurenson reviews betancourt 's moving account " how dare she insinuate something like that without evidence , " rojas said .
in fact , she says , betancourt suggested she should hand her son manuel over to the rebels and forget about him .
other former hostages who spent time in captivity alongside betancourt have also spoken out against her , calling her arrogant .
her estranged husband juan carlos lecompte has filed for divorce , citing her infidelity .
her recent request for millions of dollars in compensation from the colombian government , which she later withdrew , has brought her further disapproval .
nonetheless , " even silence has an end " shows that she is also capable of self-criticism .
" i was n't sensitive enough to understand their despair , " she writes of the other hostages who did not have her celebrity status .
" i saw myself as a symbol that could be useful for all of us .
i did not understand that everyone needs to have a face . "

friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

the thanet offshore wind farm will generate enough electricity to power more than 200,000 homes . the world 's biggest wind farm has opened just off england 's south eastern coast .
swedish energy company vattenfall said the thanet offshore wind farm 's 100 turbines will generate enough electricity to power the equivalent to the annual consumption of more than 200,000 british households .
a total of 341 turbines will be installed over the next four years under the project , at a total cost of 780 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion dollars -rrb- .
the thanet farm , which covers an area of more than 35 square kilometers , will be able to produce up to 300 megawatts -lrb- mw -rrb- of electricity from the english channel winds and will constitute a significant contribution of green energy in the uk .
each turbine is 115 meters tall .
construction of the thanet offshore wind farm took two years and is expected to operate for at least 25 years .
britain 's wind farms currently have a capacity of 5 gigawatts -lrb- gw -rrb- , with a further 18 gigawatts of wind capacity under construction or in the planning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy secretary chris huhne said the uk was in a unique position to harness wind energy potential world wind leader ?
over the next decade , around 10,000 turbines are expected to become operational around britain 's coasts .
" we are in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry .
we are an island nation and i firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind , wave and tidal resources to the maximum , " energy and climate change secretary chris huhne said at the opening .
the opportunity has attracted big overseas investors , including vattenfall , norway 's statoil , and germany 's rwe .
environmental group friends of the earth welcomed the opening as an " important stride forward " in securing future energy supplies , but also said britain 's international record on the use of renewable energy was still " dismal . "
recent statistics show an increase of 31 percent in wind power generation in britain in 2009 .
the proportion of wind power in overall energy production in britain now stands at 5 percent .
the uk government aims to cover 15 percent of its energy needs from renewable energy by 2020 .
" today 's developments are of tremendous significance .
in 2002 the uk was generating around 2 percent of all electricity from renewables .
we are now on the threshold of 10 per cent , having increased outputs five-fold , " said maria mccaffery of renewableuk , the wind energy trade body .
critics have questioned the costs and efficiency of the government 's wind energy plans , given their dependency on the variable powers of the wind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 24.09.2010 postcard from europe : betancourt book sparks controversy in france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took betancourt 18 months to write about her captivity former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt spent years as a prisoner in the country 's jungle .
now she has released a highly criticized book about it , as john laurenson reports in this postcard from paris . it was a photo that went around the world : ingrid betancourt , frail , pale and thin , her hair down to her waist , her eyes lowered in submission like a latter-day joan of arc .
the snapshot of the french-colombian politician taken by her captors in the middle of the jungle is a moving one , which redoubled the activity of her support groups , especially among politicians , journalists and actors in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farc rebels released this picture of betancourt in captivity betancourt was kidnapped in 2002 by the revolutionary armed forces -lrb- farc -rrb- of colombia while campaigning as a candidate for a political formation called green oxygen to become president of the country .
her memoir " even silence has an end " tells us what happened over the next six-and-a-half years .
there were mosquitoes and snakes , humiliations meted out by her guards .
she writes of her faith that buoyed her up and her wonderment at the beauty of the jungle .
but there was also her collapsing health , malaria and meager diet - the meals of flour and , if she was lucky , monkey meat .
towards the end of her ordeal , her fervent catholic faith abandoned her , causing the steep decline of hope and her gradual slipping towards death .
she describes how , on five occasions , she escaped - only to be stopped by the enormous and hostile jungle and captured again .
and she makes it clear she was sexually abused by her guards .
the book was handwritten , as if , perhaps , she were still denying herself the luxury of a computer in the world of celebrity , wealth and freedom she has returned to .
she told french media that she had intended to write in spanish but ultimately found the experience too painful , and turned to french , the language she was schooled in .
critical voices but reactions by betancourt 's fellow hostages have soured the book 's international release this week .
her presidential running-mate clara rojas has sharply criticized the book , saying it contains " lies and spite . "
rojas had a baby in 2006 while being held captive but , she says , she did not request to have the child in captivity as betancourt claims in her book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's john laurenson reviews betancourt 's moving account " how dare she insinuate something like that without evidence , " rojas said .
in fact , she says , betancourt suggested she should hand her son manuel over to the rebels and forget about him .
other former hostages who spent time in captivity alongside betancourt have also spoken out against her , calling her arrogant .
her estranged husband juan carlos lecompte has filed for divorce , citing her infidelity .
her recent request for millions of dollars in compensation from the colombian government , which she later withdrew , has brought her further disapproval .
nonetheless , " even silence has an end " shows that she is also capable of self-criticism .
" i was n't sensitive enough to understand their despair , " she writes of the other hostages who did not have her celebrity status .
" i saw myself as a symbol that could be useful for all of us .
i did not understand that everyone needs to have a face . "

he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .

"
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .

it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .

so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .
" the president of ecuador is playing a double role , " he told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand he is using the initiative to say ' look how green we are and how hard we are working to protect the environment ' , but on the other , he grants licenses for the drilling of oil in other regions . "

but it ’ s not only the buildings that look different - the people have changed as well . it occurred to me recently that berlin has acquired some manners .
whereas once upon a time , not all that many years ago , it had a reputation for extreme rudeness , the german capital now manages to elicit accolades of " cool , " " creative , " " open " and most surprisingly , " friendly . "
when i first moved to the city 's former east in 1995 , it was anything but .
such shops as there were did not dispense niceties with their goods ; a smile cost extra and daring to cross the threshold with anything but the correct change in one 's pocket was a crime sometimes severe enough to mean returning home empty-handed .
in restaurants and on public transport the picture was similar .
i recall being served a meal i had not ordered and then being told it was my fault and i should just eat it anyway .
on a bus i was once refused the right to travel because although i had the correct fare , it was comprised of too many small coins for the driver 's taste .
in short , the customer was certainly not the proverbial king .
and then there were the neighbors .
" stop that noise ! " " what noise ? "
my first experience of nachbarn from hell was in a flat in berlin mitte .
i lived above a couple who kept to themselves - and kept a broomstick close at hand .
whenever the sounds of my quiet , unintrusive day-to-day life became too much for them , they would pound it on their ceiling -lrb- my floor . -rrb-
when i saw them on the stairs they would offer me a " guten tag " begrudging enough to make me consider moving out .
in the end they left before i did , but i have lived above others of their ilk since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more smiling faces in berlin these days ...
i 'm sure such unfathomably grumpy types are not restricted to the bit of berlin that languished behind the wall for so many years , but the fact that they exist here at all stands in stark contrast to the much-told tale of gdr camaraderie .
ask most former citizens of east germany what they liked about it , and they will tell you that necessity drove them into one another 's hearts and homes , and that thus an unbeatable sense of community was born .
or perhaps not .
the fact that during the four decades of its existence more than half a million citizens of the gdr signed up to spy on their friends , neighbors and relatives is a trifling detail that often gets lost on those animated trips down memory lane .
but even if the community spirit was stronger than the rotkaeppchen sparkling wine that was its likely genesis , it did n't make for a friendly city .
illusory good cheer i was talking about this issue with a friend of mine , who was born and grew up in east berlin , the other day .
when i challenged her belief that the capital of old was more friendly than the city in which we both live today , she back-tracked a little to concede that what had passed then for cheerfulness was perhaps just an illusion , born of the same necessity that led to the much-lauded sense of community .
if i am surrounded by the tristesse of gray streets and buildings , she went on , am i really going to be open or well-disposed to others ?
she answered her own question with a succinct " no . "
it would be facile to suggest that a coat of paint is enough to change the fabric of a city , but there is absolutely no doubt that berlin feels more chirpy now than it did when i first got here .
in terms of the service sector , this has much to do with management training and the competitive realities of a consumer society , but they can not explain the new vibe on the street .
there , demographics are at play .
bildunterschrift : ... and grey facades are starting to be replaced by color the past few years have seen an increased influx of both germans from other parts of the country and foreigners who come to berlin because they want to be here and because they want to help shape the place in which they live .
that is not to say that the original east berliners have packed up and left , as many have not .
but they have mixed and mingled to create the " friendly " city that new visitors rave about .
although i personally would n't go so far as to say the modern capital is all about smiles , it has certainly learnt to turn up the corners of its mouth .
at my local supermarket , the cashiers have clearly been taught to ask customers if they have had a successful shopping trip .
the words sound a little odd coming from some of their pursed lips , but i do n't mind because it makes a world of difference .

when i first moved to the city 's former east in 1995 , it was anything but .
such shops as there were did not dispense niceties with their goods ; a smile cost extra and daring to cross the threshold with anything but the correct change in one 's pocket was a crime sometimes severe enough to mean returning home empty-handed .
in restaurants and on public transport the picture was similar .
i recall being served a meal i had not ordered and then being told it was my fault and i should just eat it anyway .
on a bus i was once refused the right to travel because although i had the correct fare , it was comprised of too many small coins for the driver 's taste .
in short , the customer was certainly not the proverbial king .

" stop that noise ! " " what noise ? "
my first experience of nachbarn from hell was in a flat in berlin mitte .
i lived above a couple who kept to themselves - and kept a broomstick close at hand .
whenever the sounds of my quiet , unintrusive day-to-day life became too much for them , they would pound it on their ceiling -lrb- my floor . -rrb-

i 'm sure such unfathomably grumpy types are not restricted to the bit of berlin that languished behind the wall for so many years , but the fact that they exist here at all stands in stark contrast to the much-told tale of gdr camaraderie .
ask most former citizens of east germany what they liked about it , and they will tell you that necessity drove them into one another 's hearts and homes , and that thus an unbeatable sense of community was born .
or perhaps not .
the fact that during the four decades of its existence more than half a million citizens of the gdr signed up to spy on their friends , neighbors and relatives is a trifling detail that often gets lost on those animated trips down memory lane .
but even if the community spirit was stronger than the rotkaeppchen sparkling wine that was its likely genesis , it did n't make for a friendly city .
illusory good cheer i was talking about this issue with a friend of mine , who was born and grew up in east berlin , the other day .
when i challenged her belief that the capital of old was more friendly than the city in which we both live today , she back-tracked a little to concede that what had passed then for cheerfulness was perhaps just an illusion , born of the same necessity that led to the much-lauded sense of community .
if i am surrounded by the tristesse of gray streets and buildings , she went on , am i really going to be open or well-disposed to others ?
she answered her own question with a succinct " no . "
it would be facile to suggest that a coat of paint is enough to change the fabric of a city , but there is absolutely no doubt that berlin feels more chirpy now than it did when i first got here .
in terms of the service sector , this has much to do with management training and the competitive realities of a consumer society , but they can not explain the new vibe on the street .
there , demographics are at play .
bildunterschrift : ... and grey facades are starting to be replaced by color the past few years have seen an increased influx of both germans from other parts of the country and foreigners who come to berlin because they want to be here and because they want to help shape the place in which they live .
that is not to say that the original east berliners have packed up and left , as many have not .
but they have mixed and mingled to create the " friendly " city that new visitors rave about .
although i personally would n't go so far as to say the modern capital is all about smiles , it has certainly learnt to turn up the corners of its mouth .
at my local supermarket , the cashiers have clearly been taught to ask customers if they have had a successful shopping trip .
the words sound a little odd coming from some of their pursed lips , but i do n't mind because it makes a world of difference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 24.09.2010 postcard from europe : betancourt book sparks controversy in france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took betancourt 18 months to write about her captivity former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt spent years as a prisoner in the country 's jungle .
now she has released a highly criticized book about it , as john laurenson reports in this postcard from paris . it was a photo that went around the world : ingrid betancourt , frail , pale and thin , her hair down to her waist , her eyes lowered in submission like a latter-day joan of arc .
the snapshot of the french-colombian politician taken by her captors in the middle of the jungle is a moving one , which redoubled the activity of her support groups , especially among politicians , journalists and actors in france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farc rebels released this picture of betancourt in captivity betancourt was kidnapped in 2002 by the revolutionary armed forces -lrb- farc -rrb- of colombia while campaigning as a candidate for a political formation called green oxygen to become president of the country .
her memoir " even silence has an end " tells us what happened over the next six-and-a-half years .
there were mosquitoes and snakes , humiliations meted out by her guards .
she writes of her faith that buoyed her up and her wonderment at the beauty of the jungle .
but there was also her collapsing health , malaria and meager diet - the meals of flour and , if she was lucky , monkey meat .
towards the end of her ordeal , her fervent catholic faith abandoned her , causing the steep decline of hope and her gradual slipping towards death .
she describes how , on five occasions , she escaped - only to be stopped by the enormous and hostile jungle and captured again .
and she makes it clear she was sexually abused by her guards .
the book was handwritten , as if , perhaps , she were still denying herself the luxury of a computer in the world of celebrity , wealth and freedom she has returned to .
she told french media that she had intended to write in spanish but ultimately found the experience too painful , and turned to french , the language she was schooled in .
critical voices but reactions by betancourt 's fellow hostages have soured the book 's international release this week .
her presidential running-mate clara rojas has sharply criticized the book , saying it contains " lies and spite . "
rojas had a baby in 2006 while being held captive but , she says , she did not request to have the child in captivity as betancourt claims in her book .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's john laurenson reviews betancourt 's moving account " how dare she insinuate something like that without evidence , " rojas said .
in fact , she says , betancourt suggested she should hand her son manuel over to the rebels and forget about him .
other former hostages who spent time in captivity alongside betancourt have also spoken out against her , calling her arrogant .
her estranged husband juan carlos lecompte has filed for divorce , citing her infidelity .
her recent request for millions of dollars in compensation from the colombian government , which she later withdrew , has brought her further disapproval .
nonetheless , " even silence has an end " shows that she is also capable of self-criticism .
" i was n't sensitive enough to understand their despair , " she writes of the other hostages who did not have her celebrity status .
" i saw myself as a symbol that could be useful for all of us .
i did not understand that everyone needs to have a face . "

this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .
prediction : hannover 2-1 last week 's result : 4 points mainz – cologne 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction 0-0 -rrb- hannover – bremen 4-1 -lrb- dw prediction 2-4 -rrb- hoffenheim – bayern 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- leverkusen – frankfurt 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- dortmund – kaiserslautern 5-0 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- hamburg – wolfsburg 1-3 -lrb- dw prediction 2-1 -rrb- moenchengladbach – st. pauli 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 2-0 -rrb- freiburg – schalke 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction 1-1 -rrb- nuremberg – stuttgart 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 19 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 24.09.2010 berlin lightens up as foreign smiles trump the grumps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in just two decades berlin has undergone a major facelift .
but it ’ s not only the buildings that look different - the people have changed as well . it occurred to me recently that berlin has acquired some manners .
whereas once upon a time , not all that many years ago , it had a reputation for extreme rudeness , the german capital now manages to elicit accolades of " cool , " " creative , " " open " and most surprisingly , " friendly . "
when i first moved to the city 's former east in 1995 , it was anything but .
such shops as there were did not dispense niceties with their goods ; a smile cost extra and daring to cross the threshold with anything but the correct change in one 's pocket was a crime sometimes severe enough to mean returning home empty-handed .
in restaurants and on public transport the picture was similar .
i recall being served a meal i had not ordered and then being told it was my fault and i should just eat it anyway .
on a bus i was once refused the right to travel because although i had the correct fare , it was comprised of too many small coins for the driver 's taste .
in short , the customer was certainly not the proverbial king .
and then there were the neighbors .
" stop that noise ! " " what noise ? "
my first experience of nachbarn from hell was in a flat in berlin mitte .
i lived above a couple who kept to themselves - and kept a broomstick close at hand .
whenever the sounds of my quiet , unintrusive day-to-day life became too much for them , they would pound it on their ceiling -lrb- my floor . -rrb-
when i saw them on the stairs they would offer me a " guten tag " begrudging enough to make me consider moving out .
in the end they left before i did , but i have lived above others of their ilk since .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more smiling faces in berlin these days ...
i 'm sure such unfathomably grumpy types are not restricted to the bit of berlin that languished behind the wall for so many years , but the fact that they exist here at all stands in stark contrast to the much-told tale of gdr camaraderie .
ask most former citizens of east germany what they liked about it , and they will tell you that necessity drove them into one another 's hearts and homes , and that thus an unbeatable sense of community was born .
or perhaps not .
the fact that during the four decades of its existence more than half a million citizens of the gdr signed up to spy on their friends , neighbors and relatives is a trifling detail that often gets lost on those animated trips down memory lane .
but even if the community spirit was stronger than the rotkaeppchen sparkling wine that was its likely genesis , it did n't make for a friendly city .
illusory good cheer i was talking about this issue with a friend of mine , who was born and grew up in east berlin , the other day .
when i challenged her belief that the capital of old was more friendly than the city in which we both live today , she back-tracked a little to concede that what had passed then for cheerfulness was perhaps just an illusion , born of the same necessity that led to the much-lauded sense of community .
if i am surrounded by the tristesse of gray streets and buildings , she went on , am i really going to be open or well-disposed to others ?
she answered her own question with a succinct " no . "
it would be facile to suggest that a coat of paint is enough to change the fabric of a city , but there is absolutely no doubt that berlin feels more chirpy now than it did when i first got here .
in terms of the service sector , this has much to do with management training and the competitive realities of a consumer society , but they can not explain the new vibe on the street .
there , demographics are at play .
bildunterschrift : ... and grey facades are starting to be replaced by color the past few years have seen an increased influx of both germans from other parts of the country and foreigners who come to berlin because they want to be here and because they want to help shape the place in which they live .
that is not to say that the original east berliners have packed up and left , as many have not .
but they have mixed and mingled to create the " friendly " city that new visitors rave about .
although i personally would n't go so far as to say the modern capital is all about smiles , it has certainly learnt to turn up the corners of its mouth .
at my local supermarket , the cashiers have clearly been taught to ask customers if they have had a successful shopping trip .
the words sound a little odd coming from some of their pursed lips , but i do n't mind because it makes a world of difference .

friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .

this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan . " one thing is clear , if civil society hadn ’ t pitched in people here would be really in bad shape , " says the retired college principal syeda basheer chandio . pakistani civil society mobilized famous television hosts have also been collecting donations in their shows . " the government is helping the people , we can ’ t say they ’ re not doing anything , " says shahzad , an engineer from hyderabad who has been in the flood-affected regions with his colleague yasir for weeks . " but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .
what can we do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects . " the international community will probably invest billions into pakistan ’ s reconstruction but it would do well to take time to find out how the money can be used most efficiently . author : thomas baerthlein -lrb- hyderabad -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 24.09.2010 german satellite meets fiery end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 years of work up in smoke - but not for nothing after 10 years in orbit and 58277 trips around the earth , the georesearch satellite champ collected material that made for one of the most successful earth observation missions yet , say researchers . it was a quick end to a long life for champ , the challenging mini satellite payload .
after 3718 days of providing information to researchers on the ground , the satellite burnt up on september 19 , 2010 over the sea of okhotsk , somewhere between eastern siberia , the russian peninsular of kamchatka and japan .
it was " one of the most successful observation missions of the earth 's system , " said professor reinhard huettle , ceo of the potsdam-based german research center for geosciences , better known by its german acronym , gfz .
this was the center that first designed the champ project in 1995 .
since then the satellite has provided geoscientists with groundbreaking new insights .
the ' potsdam gravity potato ' the information provided by champ allowed researchers , for instance , to better capture the earth 's form – dips and bulges included .
this allowed researchers to develop an image of earth not as a perfect sphere but as a ' floating potato ' – the ' potsdam gravity potato ' .
bildunterschrift : the ' potato earth ' as seen by champ this was possible because champ was set on an irregular orbit around the earth : at times it was more attracted to the earth , at times less .
for the first time , researchers were able to trace the satellite 's path continuously and accurately , to within centimeters , and were able to reconstruct the shape of the earth second by second .
champ also offered researchers new insights into the earth 's magnetic field , allowing them to recognize that field strength decreases continuously , particularly in the southern atlantic ocean , which in turn leads to frequent disruptions in satellite operation .
what 's more , the satellite allowed for the creation of global maps of important mineral and ore deposits – pointing to iron ore in kursk , russia , and diamonds in west africa – as these deposits could be seen for the first time through analysis of the magnetization of the rock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth 's magnetic field come rain or shine measurements taken by the satellite have also been used in weather forecasting and climate research .
for the first time in 2006 , the british ' met office ' used the satellite 's data to create global weather forecasts .
champ data has also been used in centers in europe , japan and canada .
the satellite also proved unexpectedly useful in monitoring space weather , allowing meteorologists to predict storms in the ionosphere , an outer layer of the earth 's atmosphere , more quickly .
these storms can interfere with telecommunications , satellite navigation and radio-radar systems .
15 years of work the champ project began in 1995 when the german education and research ministry developed a satellite mission as a flagship project for the east german space industry , to try to promote existing knowledge of the field within east germany .
five years on , when the 522kg -lrb- 1150lb -rrb- champ satellite was launched , it was originally thought it would stay in orbit for five years at most .
but the satellite 's design allowed it such a stable flight , even at a low flight path , that the mission time could be more than doubled .

or how about an unforgettable , quick gift ?
consumers in madrid can now use a unique automated teller machine to fetch gold bars of up to 10 grams and coins with custom designs in exchange for cash .
the atm , known as " gold to go , " is the brainchild of thomas geissler .

now gold enthusiasts in europe are on geissler 's radar , too .
spain is among the first of several targeted markets in europe , including austria , germany and switzerland .
in madrid , the gold dispenser is located in the five-star westin palace hotel , a favorite stomping ground for the rich and famous .
soaring demand for gold at first glance , some people could mistake the six-foot tall , gold-leaf-finished machine as some tacky casino attraction .

8 after two weeks of escalating tension between japan and china , japanese prosecutors have decided to release the chinese captain of a fishing boat involved in a collision near disputed islands in the east china sea . japan responded to china 's increasingly loud threats to react with " further action " by freeing the 41-year-old zhan qixiong , whom the japanese had accused of deliberately ramming two japanese coastguard vessels . the impact on the japanese people and the relationship between japan and china was cited as the main reason for the release . bildunterschrift : one of the disputed islands in the east china sea , claimed by china and japan the prosecutors said that the captain had not committed a " premeditated criminal act but had acted on the spur of the moment " . tense diplomatic row however , this supposedly spontaneous act took place in disputed territory and sparked a diplomatic row of a scale not seen for a long time . japan calls the chain of islands near the scene of the collision senkaku , whereas china calls it diaoyu .
the two countries claim the islets and the oil-rich surrounding area . on friday , the conservative opposition lashed out at the prosecutors ' decision , saying that they had caved in to chinese pressure unnecessarily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew of the fishing boat was released on 13 .
sept. but the captain was detained for longer indeed , earlier this week , seiji maehara , the new japanese foreign minister , had made it crystal clear what japan ’ s position was : " the senkaku islands are an integral part of japan and there is no territorial conflict regarding these islands .
the japanese government will continue to be calm about the situation and will act according to japanese law . " as the dispute escalated , however , the two countries came under international pressure to resolve it through dialogue . china warns prosecutors not to take legal action after hearing the captain would be released , beijing once again repeated that any legal action taken against the captain would be " illegal and invalid " . liu jiangyong , an expert in international relations at qinghua university , accused tokyo of incompetence : " ever since coming to power , the democratic party of japan has been pro-american in foreign policy , and in controversial issues such as international law , bilateral problems between the two nations , and how they should be solved , they have no experience and they don ’ t know the rules and proceedings of international politics . " despite loud accusations and threats , in the end , some analysts predicted , the dispute would not come to much , considering the growing importance of sino-japanese trade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dispute led to anti-japan protests in beijing and hong kong economic necessities outweigh spats china is now japan ’ s biggest trading partner .
christian geltinger , who knows both countries well having spent years in qingdao representing the german state of bavaria and now being based in tokyo had a " easy-going attitude . " " there will always be this kind of spat , " he said .
" but the economic necessity to work together is stronger .
japan has considerably relaxed the entry requirements for chinese travellers and there is a keen desire to exploit the chinese tourist potential in japan .
people already speak good chinese in the stores here and chinese credit cards are accepted .
the real exchange between china and japan has made great progress . " this is a view confirmed by hiroshi tsukamoto , the commissioner general of the japanese pavilion at expo 2010 in shanghai : " we think china is a country of great opportunity .
and shanghai expo is a very good occasion from a business point of view . " some 20,000 chinese visitors a day pop into the japanese pavilion , where they can see what the future bodes by playing with robots or checking out the latest high-tech gadgets . author : anne thomas editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move could save billions from national defense budgets . european defense ministers meeting in belgium have discussed the need to step up military and defense cooperation in a bid to cut billions of euros from domestic defense budgets .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was among those who championed the idea of closer cooperation on defense at the meeting in the city of ghent , but acknowledged that any such plan would face significant obstacles .
" we should join our forces more , but we also have to see the hurdles , " guttenberg said .
" these are national hurdles .
in germany , for example , parliament has to agree to every foreign mission .
while that has been a very good thing , it can also be an obstacle in the european context . "
the proposal is that , in the future , eu countries could cut defense budgets in two ways : first , different member states could specialize in different aspects of defense , and second , the bloc could band together in the defense procurement process to secure better deals .
guttenberg has also pushed his own three-step model to help aid such defense cooperation .
the plan would first involve defining those domestic defense capabilities that were absolutely necessary for individual eu member states , then ascertaining the areas in which cooperation could bring savings , and , finally , allocating defense specialties to individual countries , which would then make their defense resources available to other eu members in the case of emergencies .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says eu members could specialize their defense capabilities christian schmidt , parliamentary secretary at the german defense ministry , said on the sidelines of the ministers ' meeting that the pressure on governments to cut costs had " led to the realization that we have a lot of common interests in europe . "
" there is a general consensus that in these current times we can not afford to carry out operations at the same capacity nor as efficiently . "
guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal grouping in the european parliament , went one step further , arguing for a common european army .
" we have now a diplomatic service , which is very important , but we also need the other instrument - a common european defense , a common european army , " he said .
" and certainly , at a time when every european country has to make savings , maybe it 's the right time to build up this common european army .
there are two million soldiers in europe , but only 300,000 in the us , and i think that the american army is more efficient that the european forces .
so that 's a good reason to start this . "
sino-american dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morin says defense cooperation would minimize the influence of the us on europe the french defense minister , herve morin , said that if europe failed to boost defense cooperation , it risked becoming a puppet of the united states and china .
" at the rate we 're going , we risk europe gradually becoming a protectorate - 50 years from now we 'll become a pawn in the balance between the new powers and we 'll be under a joint dominion of china and america , " morin told reporters .
" all the countries of the world are re-arming and the europeans , who already before the crisis had really weak budgets , have now carried out new reductions . "
the french defense minister said eu states should formulate a list of defense capabilities that should remain under the control of individual states and those that should be shared .
also on the agenda at the meeting was the ongoing conflict in afghanistan .
german defense minister guttenberg said germany intended to increase its efforts in training security forces in the country .
he said that as many as 1,600 soldiers could be performing this task by the end of october .

the move could save billions from national defense budgets . european defense ministers meeting in belgium have discussed the need to step up military and defense cooperation in a bid to cut billions of euros from domestic defense budgets .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg was among those who championed the idea of closer cooperation on defense at the meeting in the city of ghent , but acknowledged that any such plan would face significant obstacles .
" we should join our forces more , but we also have to see the hurdles , " guttenberg said .
" these are national hurdles .
in germany , for example , parliament has to agree to every foreign mission .
while that has been a very good thing , it can also be an obstacle in the european context . "
the proposal is that , in the future , eu countries could cut defense budgets in two ways : first , different member states could specialize in different aspects of defense , and second , the bloc could band together in the defense procurement process to secure better deals .
guttenberg has also pushed his own three-step model to help aid such defense cooperation .
the plan would first involve defining those domestic defense capabilities that were absolutely necessary for individual eu member states , then ascertaining the areas in which cooperation could bring savings , and , finally , allocating defense specialties to individual countries , which would then make their defense resources available to other eu members in the case of emergencies .
a european army ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says eu members could specialize their defense capabilities christian schmidt , parliamentary secretary at the german defense ministry , said on the sidelines of the ministers ' meeting that the pressure on governments to cut costs had " led to the realization that we have a lot of common interests in europe . "
" there is a general consensus that in these current times we can not afford to carry out operations at the same capacity nor as efficiently . "
guy verhofstadt , who leads the liberal grouping in the european parliament , went one step further , arguing for a common european army .
" we have now a diplomatic service , which is very important , but we also need the other instrument - a common european defense , a common european army , " he said .
" and certainly , at a time when every european country has to make savings , maybe it 's the right time to build up this common european army .
there are two million soldiers in europe , but only 300,000 in the us , and i think that the american army is more efficient that the european forces .
so that 's a good reason to start this . "
sino-american dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morin says defense cooperation would minimize the influence of the us on europe the french defense minister , herve morin , said that if europe failed to boost defense cooperation , it risked becoming a puppet of the united states and china .
" at the rate we 're going , we risk europe gradually becoming a protectorate - 50 years from now we 'll become a pawn in the balance between the new powers and we 'll be under a joint dominion of china and america , " morin told reporters .
" all the countries of the world are re-arming and the europeans , who already before the crisis had really weak budgets , have now carried out new reductions . "
the french defense minister said eu states should formulate a list of defense capabilities that should remain under the control of individual states and those that should be shared .
also on the agenda at the meeting was the ongoing conflict in afghanistan .
german defense minister guttenberg said germany intended to increase its efforts in training security forces in the country .
he said that as many as 1,600 soldiers could be performing this task by the end of october .

he is wearing a traditional bhutanese robe .
he has a low voice and he comes across as a modest , well-balanced man who is satisfied with life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutan is close to achieving the un millenium development goals he is the president of the center for bhutan studies .
since 1999 , his research group has been trying to measure the scale of happiness among the bhutanese : gross national happiness -lrb- gnh -rrb- .
but can happiness be measured ? " we do not measure what you call meta-feelings but positive emotional states like generosity and compassion , and the absence of excessive frequency of anger , frustration and jealousy are good indicators of whether people feel happy or not .
we can measure indirectly .
if you are a victim of very frequent anger and frustration , obviously it means that your mental state - for whatever reason - is not pro-happiness . " 72 indicators of happiness karma ura has developed 72 indicators to measure happiness , which he has divided into nine categories - physical well-being , education and good governance are only a few . bhutanese households are given questionnaires to fill out on a regular basis , which karma ura ’ s research group then evaluates . some example questions are : have you ever thought of committing suicide ?
or how often do you experience jealousy ? however , karma ura knows it is more difficult to measure gross national happiness than it is to measure gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
" our method of aggregating various indicators into one single composite gnh measure is not really perfect .
it is just an attempt , an exploration or a work in progress .
over the years , we will see a refinement of this method . " i must mention that happiness is not to be confused with momentary pleasure .
it is more lasting , more durable , more satisfying , a feature of your life .
let ’ s ask ourselves whether we can develop alternative indices of well-being so that we are not misguided into thinking that gdp and economics alone define what is well-being and happiness for us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to measure national happiness , questionaires are distributed to households rethinking values to make a better world does he think that violent conflicts , ecological disasters and economic crises are the result of pursuing the wrong values ? not necessarily , but the concept of gnh can certainly help contribute to a more balanced world . " the western world is rethinking what is a good economy , what is a good life , what is good politics , what is good governance .
there is a fresh enquiry going on around the world .
gnh can be part of the debate and the discourse .
we must harvest and tap into good ideas coming from everywhere – anything that offers a path forward has to be examined . " this week , bhutan ’ s prime minister jigmi thinley addressed the united nations general assembly and suggested adding happiness to the millennium development goals . he left the podium with a smile and received a strong ovation .
this gave the world leaders a moment of amusement , perhaps even of happiness . author : chi viet giang editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is wearing a traditional bhutanese robe .
he has a low voice and he comes across as a modest , well-balanced man who is satisfied with life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bhutan is close to achieving the un millenium development goals he is the president of the center for bhutan studies .
since 1999 , his research group has been trying to measure the scale of happiness among the bhutanese : gross national happiness -lrb- gnh -rrb- .
but can happiness be measured ? " we do not measure what you call meta-feelings but positive emotional states like generosity and compassion , and the absence of excessive frequency of anger , frustration and jealousy are good indicators of whether people feel happy or not .
we can measure indirectly .
if you are a victim of very frequent anger and frustration , obviously it means that your mental state - for whatever reason - is not pro-happiness . " 72 indicators of happiness karma ura has developed 72 indicators to measure happiness , which he has divided into nine categories - physical well-being , education and good governance are only a few . bhutanese households are given questionnaires to fill out on a regular basis , which karma ura ’ s research group then evaluates . some example questions are : have you ever thought of committing suicide ?
or how often do you experience jealousy ? however , karma ura knows it is more difficult to measure gross national happiness than it is to measure gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
" our method of aggregating various indicators into one single composite gnh measure is not really perfect .
it is just an attempt , an exploration or a work in progress .
over the years , we will see a refinement of this method . " i must mention that happiness is not to be confused with momentary pleasure .
it is more lasting , more durable , more satisfying , a feature of your life .
let ’ s ask ourselves whether we can develop alternative indices of well-being so that we are not misguided into thinking that gdp and economics alone define what is well-being and happiness for us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to measure national happiness , questionaires are distributed to households rethinking values to make a better world does he think that violent conflicts , ecological disasters and economic crises are the result of pursuing the wrong values ? not necessarily , but the concept of gnh can certainly help contribute to a more balanced world . " the western world is rethinking what is a good economy , what is a good life , what is good politics , what is good governance .
there is a fresh enquiry going on around the world .
gnh can be part of the debate and the discourse .
we must harvest and tap into good ideas coming from everywhere – anything that offers a path forward has to be examined . " this week , bhutan ’ s prime minister jigmi thinley addressed the united nations general assembly and suggested adding happiness to the millennium development goals . he left the podium with a smile and received a strong ovation .
this gave the world leaders a moment of amusement , perhaps even of happiness . author : chi viet giang editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 24.09.2010 germany voices reservations about ecuador 's oil fund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sight the yasuni itt fund wants to prevent when ecuador first mooted the idea of foregoing massive oil reserves under the yasuni national park in exchange for donations worth half its value , berlin was on board .
but now the government appears reluctant to commit . earlier this month , chile became the first country to pay into a trust fund set up in order to protect ecuador 's yasuni park and its indigenous peoples from the destructive hand of the oil business .
at a ceremony in quito , the chilean minister of foreign affairs , alfredo moreno charme , handed over a certificate of deposit worth 75,000 euros -lrb- $ 100,000 -rrb- .
he acknowledged that it was a small sum of money , a drop in the ocean of the 75 million euros ecuador is hoping to receive before the end of 2011 , but stressed that it was symbolic of his country 's " commitment " to the yasuni ishpingo-tambococha-tiputini -lrb- itt -rrb- initiative .
the gesture prompted observers to suggest that spain and germany - a proponent of the scheme from the outset - would be quick to follow chile 's lead .
but in the case of germany , at least , that is not the way things are panning out .
last week , development minister dirk niebel suddenly announced that far from champing at the bit to throw money into the pot , under the current conditions berlin was not willing to pay anything at all .
the wrong sign the statement , which reverses a 2008 grand coalition resolution to invest generously in the initiative , has met with widespread criticism from opposition parties and environmental groups .
they say the about-turn is not only an embarrassment for berlin but sends the wrong message to the rest of the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel " it is a bad signal if one of the richest nations wo n't support the initiative , " thomas brose , director of climate alliance told deutsche welle " not only for countries thinking about becoming donors but for others like peru , bolivia and guatemala that are considering implementing similar projects of their own . "
while brose would welcome more ventures like the yasuni trust , which could potentially keep 407 million tones of carbon dioxide from making it into the earth 's atmosphere , germany 's federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- is more skeptical about the ethos of the fund and the culture it could breed .
" one of our main questions is whether this would be setting a precedent for other governments , " bmz spokesman sebastian lesch told deutsche welle .
" our objective is to pursue active policies for active countries , not pay them to do nothing . "
positive plans the fund administrator , the united nations development program -lrb- undp -rrb- maintains that is not what would happen .
it says the fund , which is looking to collect 2.7 billion euros by 2024 - 50 percent of what it would have made from oil extraction at the yasuni site - would provide for investment in renewables , help change the country 's power matrix and offer support for greater industrial and domestic energy efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to invest in alternative sources of energy yet niebel is unconvinced .
another major sticking point for the development minister is that of guarantee .
he says the terms of agreement between ecuador and the undp , are not sufficient to prevent future governments from going ahead and drilling for crude in the 200,000 hectare itt section of the yasuni park .
as it stands , the government of ecuador has pledged to issue yasuni guarantee certificates -lrb- cgys -rrb- to contributors , promising their money back should any subsequent government decide to exploit the oil reserves .
working to a deadline but that is too vague for berlin .
lesch says both that issue and the one of setting a precedent would need to be addressed satisfactorily before the ministry would consider rethinking its decision to withhold a contribution to the historic fund .
so the ball is in the ecuadorian court , which brose says is a dangerous place for it to be .

if the 75 million euros have not been raised by that date , the project will be deemed a failure and the path will be cleared for oil extraction .
brose believes the very fragility of the project means berlin can not afford to blow hot and cold .
" if the government does n't get the money it will say it tried its best , but did n't even manage to get the support of wealthy nations like germany . "
an ecuadorian delegation is due to travel to berlin this week for a trip planned before niebel 's announcement .
although the bmz says there are no hard plans to talk about the fund , a representative of the quito administration told deutsche welle that the team would take the opportunity to talk germany through its doubts regarding the initiative .

internationally recognized bachelor 's and master 's degrees have replaced virtually all of the degrees formerly conferred . in 1999 , germany signed the bologna reform agreement , which obligates participating european nations to create a more uniform educational system .
by 2020 , all participating countries have agreed to switch over to the bachelor and master system . that means students can get a quicker start in the working world and also earn degrees that are more easily compared and evaluated internationally .
the switch to the bachelor and master system is especially important for foreign students interested in studying in germany , since the changes increase the likelihood that degrees earned abroad will be recognized at home . end of the diplom and magister prior to the bologna reform , german university students earned either a diplom -lrb- in scientific and technical areas -rrb- or a magister -lrb- in the humanities and social sciences -rrb- .
students required at least eight semesters - and typically longer - to complete one of the two degrees . well over 80 percent of the programs at german universities now lead to either a bachelor or master .
a bachelor 's degree is generally intended to be completed after six semesters , while a master takes an additional two years . on the other hand , future lawyers , doctors and pharmacists do not earn degrees according to the bologna reform and are still educated in preparation for a state examination conducted at the end of their studies .
however , the process in these fields will also eventually be replaced with some variation of the bachelor and master system . enrollment requirements to apply for an undergraduate degree in germany , applicants must often show they possess certain credentials , like having adequate german skills and good prior educational records .
additionally , some programs require or recommend an internship prior to enrollment , while some arts academies require qualifying tests .
undergraduate degree programs typically lead to a bachelor or qualify the student to take germany 's state examinations in law or in medicine . master 's degrees typically require a bachelor in the same or a closely related field , while phd programs generally seek students that have earned a master with academic distinction in the same field . author : claudia unseld , gaby reucher editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan . " one thing is clear , if civil society hadn ’ t pitched in people here would be really in bad shape , " says the retired college principal syeda basheer chandio . pakistani civil society mobilized famous television hosts have also been collecting donations in their shows . " the government is helping the people , we can ’ t say they ’ re not doing anything , " says shahzad , an engineer from hyderabad who has been in the flood-affected regions with his colleague yasir for weeks . " but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .
what can we do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects . " the international community will probably invest billions into pakistan ’ s reconstruction but it would do well to take time to find out how the money can be used most efficiently . author : thomas baerthlein -lrb- hyderabad -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

consumers in madrid can now use a unique automated teller machine to fetch gold bars of up to 10 grams and coins with custom designs in exchange for cash .
the atm , known as " gold to go , " is the brainchild of thomas geissler .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.09.2010 us-vietnam nuclear deal has experts divided großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us-vietnam deal can be interpreted as a move to counter chinese influence the united states and vietnam are close to a nuclear deal that would allow hanoi the right to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium .
while china and some experts have criticized it , others view it more positively . roughly six months after signing a memorandum of understanding on civilian nuclear cooperation , washington and hanoi , according to various reports , are now in the final stages of reaching a deal on sharing nuclear technology .
the agreement will likely lack a provision that prohibits vietnam to engage in uranium enrichment and reprocessing plutonium , steps that aside from its civilian use are also essential to produce nuclear weapons . to cope with growing energy needs of its rapidly expanding economy , hanoi wants to build 13 nuclear power plants by 2030 , with the first reactor to produce energy scheduled for 2020 .
according to vietnamese media reports , the first power plant will be built with russian technology .
neighboring china , which has ongoing border disputes with vietnam , has carefully calibrated its response to the us-vietnam deal .
a foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged every nation 's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy as long as it does n't engage in proliferation .
' double standard ' however , the deputy director of the china arms control and disarmament association accused the us of applying a double standard and of destabilizing the international order .
" the us is used to employing double standards when dealing with different countries ... as a global power that has promoted denuclearization , it has challenged its own reputation and disturbed the preset international order , " teng jianqun was quoted in the official china daily newspaper .
chinese experts are not alone in criticizing the deal . charles k. ebinger , the director of the brookings institution 's energy security initiative , also charged that the agreement establishes an " unconcealed double-standard " and urged the obama administration to adopt a " singular nuclear energy cooperation policy " applicable to all countries .
critics of the deal refer to the nuclear cooperation agreement washington signed with the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- last year .
as part of the deal , the uae accepted to completely forego enrichment and reprocessing activities .
due to those tough conditions - essentially waiving the right for enrichment granted to every country that has signed the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- - the agreement with the uae was dubbed the ‘ gold standard ' of civilian nuclear cooperation deals .
by not pushing vietnam , which is a signatory of the npt and has stated that it has no intention to pursue enrichment itself , to accept the same conditions , the obama administration will make it harder to apply the gold standard in negotiations with other countries , argue critics .
what 's more , they add , the move is counterproductive to barack obama 's grand vision of reaching a world without nuclear weapons .
' important step ' however , other experts think this criticism is overblown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnam wants nuclear power plants to fuel its rapidly growing economy miles pomper , a senior research associate at the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in washington dc , notes that most nuclear deals actually do n't restrict countries to enrich and simply do n't explicitly mention the issue .
" the only deal that did n't do that was the deal the united states struck with united arab emirates which was finalized last year and was negotiated under the bush administration , " he told deutsche welle .
" and that deal was kind of unusual because the us wanted to set the gold standard for how countries in the middle east should deal with nuclear energy . "
while sebastian harnisch , professor of international relations at ruprecht-karls-university heidelberg , understands why some people perceive a double standard in those different nuclear deals , he points out that the us-vietnam deal is entirely in line with the npt which foresees the peaceful use of the nuclear energy under the international atomic energy agency 's -lrb- iaea -rrb- safeguards .
" the signal that peaceful nations in full compliance with the npt have a right to the full fuel cycle is an important step right now , " he told deutsche welle , adding that many countries like brazil and turkey worry that the us wants to restrict their ability to pursue the full fuel cycle in light of tehran 's nuclear ambitions . besides the obvious economic aspects of supplying nuclear technology to vietnam , harnisch believes washington has two additional motives for the deal : " first of all they want to signal to china that they are hedging against beijing 's influence in southeast asia and the south china sea in particular .
and secondly of course , it 's a signal to the vietnamese government that the normalization is an ongoing process and that the united states is interested in deepening that relationship . "
not as problematic as us-india deal pomper agrees that everything that is done politically in that region is done with beijing in mind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial us-india nuclear deal was finalized by the bush administration " but i think the more dangerous deal in terms of nuclear energy that we did to counter china was the us-india deal which was a clear case - much more than the vietnam case - of sacrificing our non-proliferation principles for strategic reasons . "
after all , the us had agreed to cooperate with india despite the fact that the country had not signed the npt and had amassed a stockpile of nuclear weapons .
for pomper , the us-vietnam deal then is more about establishing good relations between the former enemies and business ties .
" and i am sure germany just like the united states will be looking to try to sell nuclear technology to vietnam . "
aside from some verbal criticism out of beijing , the experts do n't think the issue will negatively impact us-china relations .
they also do n't expect hanoi to pursue nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future .
beijing for its part , has also signed a nuclear deal with hanoi and is planning to sell two nuclear power plants to pakistan .
how long it will take to complete the final negotiations for the us-vietnam deal is still open .
but since the agreement - unlike the us-india deal - is expected to comply with the us nuclear non-proliferation act of 1978 it does n't require explicit approval by congress to become law .

after starting badly , they are seeing the green shoots of recovery .
hoping to have turned a corner , they have another go this week . if bundesliga score predictions were the eurovision song contest then the dw soccer pundits were norway last weekend , scoring nul points with our self-penned flop " week four . "
after matchday five 's midweek games , we 've been upgraded to bulgaria standard after a plucky but paltry performance which - truth be told - could n't have been any worse than our previous display .
however , not ones to dwell on the past , we once again don our silk shirts , gold medallions and inappropriately tight trousers to present another rendition of bundesliga predictions for your entertainment in " week six . "
friday , september 24 cologne – hoffenheim cologne are getting an early reputation as spoilers this season after holding bayern munich to a draw and stymieing mainz until late on in the last couple of games .
mainly due to outstanding performances from goalkeeper faryd mondragon , cologne are proving obstinate opponents and hoffenheim will have to find the form that beat werder bremen 4-1 on the opening day to get a result .
that said , cologne are having a hard time scoring , so if hoffenheim can get on the board , they should win .
prediction : hoffenheim 1-0 saturday , september 25 bayern munich – mainz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are lucky to have thomas mueller in good form the reigning champions face the league leaders in an intriguing game .
will bayern 's last-gasp victory over hoffenheim in midweek kick-start their season ?
do upstarts mainz have the juice to topple the ultimate symbol of the bundesliga establishment ?
after collecting eight points from five matches thus far , bayern have yet to show much of their traditional dominance , while mainz ’ confidence has swelled .
home advantage will help bayern but if mainz keeps their fearlessness attitude , a draw is on the cards .
prediction : 1-1 frankfurt – nuremberg frankfurt already look in trouble , placed second from bottom with four defeats in five , but most of their defeats have been close and their one victory was a rout .
what seems clear thus far is that they have trouble scoring consistently and are prone to lapses in concentration .
nuremberg are scoring even less -lrb- just five goals so far -rrb- , but have a very tight defense -lrb- they ’ ve given up just five as well -rrb- .
this one has stalemate written all over it .
prediction : 0-0 schalke – moenchengladbach schalke finally got points on the board in midweek thanks to a late winner from klaas jan huntelaar against freiburg .
it was still a shaky performance from felix magath 's side and while it was a welcome boost , things look to be far from sorted in gelsenkirchen .
moenchengladbach , however , look even worse .
they ’ ve let in a staggering 17 goals thus far , and may have had their spirits broken after they surrendered a lead at home to lose to st. pauli on wednesday .
schalke will have a slight advantage in form , but do n't expect a classic .
prediction : schalke 2-1 st pauli – dortmund bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagawa has made a splash at free-scoring dortmund dortmund are rampant at the moment and are scoring goals for fun .
their style and scorelines are testament to a team with confidence at full tilt .
new signing shinji kagawa is proving to be a revelation while lucas barrios has picked up where he left off last season .
st. pauli have been a pleasant surprise so far with some solid performances but with bvb currently on fire , it should be a busy day for the pauli defense .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 stuttgart – leverkusen sloppiness cost stuttgart points at nuremberg in midweek and saturday 's clash with leverkusen will show how hard that defeat has brought them back to earth after their 7-0 demolition of moenchengladbach last weekend .
that score , as well as the performance which delivered it , may prove to be an anomaly in a season which could turn into a slog .
leverkusen has yet to catch fire this season though , and stuttgart may be able to nullify what little threat they do have .
prediction : stuttgart 1-0 bremen – hamburg an attractive north german derby with the potential to go goal crazy , this match is hard to call .
hamburg started the season strong , with ruud van nistlerooy playing like a man possessed , but have fallen off in recent weeks .
bremen , meanwhile , are capable of the sublime or the ridiculous in any given match - either hammering teams or getting trounced .
after getting spanked 4-1 by hannover in midweek , it may be time for another upswing .
but hamburg have a defeat to wolfsburg to get over too .
home advantage could be key .
prediction : bremen 3-2 sunday , september 26 wolfsburg – freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's return to germany and form is paying off for wolfsburg the wolves now know how to win again and edin dzeko has remembered how to score but the main reason for wolfsburg 's sudden return to form is diego .
the little brazilian has rediscovered his bundesliga boots after a season in the stingier italian league and is the class act steve mcclaren 's team needs to compliment dzeko .
freiburg , who have had a good run so far , gave schalke a scare in the week but i expect wolfsburg to go further down the road to recovery .
home win .
prediction : wolfsburg 2-0 kaiserslautern- hannover kaiserslautern were reminded what an unforgiving place the bundesliga could be in midweek , shipping five goals to dortmund .
but they beat bayern 2-0 and have held their own in other tough games before wednesday 's drubbing .
hannover have had a fine start to the season , only losing one game so far , and took bremen apart on tuesday night .
kaiserslautern are no pushovers but hannover may have the impetus with them in this one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 24.09.2010 german satellite meets fiery end großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 15 years of work up in smoke - but not for nothing after 10 years in orbit and 58277 trips around the earth , the georesearch satellite champ collected material that made for one of the most successful earth observation missions yet , say researchers . it was a quick end to a long life for champ , the challenging mini satellite payload .
after 3718 days of providing information to researchers on the ground , the satellite burnt up on september 19 , 2010 over the sea of okhotsk , somewhere between eastern siberia , the russian peninsular of kamchatka and japan .
it was " one of the most successful observation missions of the earth 's system , " said professor reinhard huettle , ceo of the potsdam-based german research center for geosciences , better known by its german acronym , gfz .
this was the center that first designed the champ project in 1995 .
since then the satellite has provided geoscientists with groundbreaking new insights .
the ' potsdam gravity potato ' the information provided by champ allowed researchers , for instance , to better capture the earth 's form – dips and bulges included .
this allowed researchers to develop an image of earth not as a perfect sphere but as a ' floating potato ' – the ' potsdam gravity potato ' .
bildunterschrift : the ' potato earth ' as seen by champ this was possible because champ was set on an irregular orbit around the earth : at times it was more attracted to the earth , at times less .
for the first time , researchers were able to trace the satellite 's path continuously and accurately , to within centimeters , and were able to reconstruct the shape of the earth second by second .
champ also offered researchers new insights into the earth 's magnetic field , allowing them to recognize that field strength decreases continuously , particularly in the southern atlantic ocean , which in turn leads to frequent disruptions in satellite operation .
what 's more , the satellite allowed for the creation of global maps of important mineral and ore deposits – pointing to iron ore in kursk , russia , and diamonds in west africa – as these deposits could be seen for the first time through analysis of the magnetization of the rock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the earth 's magnetic field come rain or shine measurements taken by the satellite have also been used in weather forecasting and climate research .
for the first time in 2006 , the british ' met office ' used the satellite 's data to create global weather forecasts .
champ data has also been used in centers in europe , japan and canada .
the satellite also proved unexpectedly useful in monitoring space weather , allowing meteorologists to predict storms in the ionosphere , an outer layer of the earth 's atmosphere , more quickly .
these storms can interfere with telecommunications , satellite navigation and radio-radar systems .
15 years of work the champ project began in 1995 when the german education and research ministry developed a satellite mission as a flagship project for the east german space industry , to try to promote existing knowledge of the field within east germany .
five years on , when the 522kg -lrb- 1150lb -rrb- champ satellite was launched , it was originally thought it would stay in orbit for five years at most .
but the satellite 's design allowed it such a stable flight , even at a low flight path , that the mission time could be more than doubled .

thomas baerthlein talked to victims and volunteers in jamshoro district near hyderabad -lrb- sindh -rrb- . the litany of complaints at the gulshan-e-shahbaz camp in jamshoro is familiar – there is not enough water , not enough food for the children .
women in similar camps all over the country are saying the same .
moreover , the government is not doing enough and the police are often sent in to distribute aid because they can best defend themselves against angry crowds . however , there are other scenes .
the atmosphere at gulshan-e-shahbaz 's makeshift infirmary is calm – there is enough medicine and everybody is treated in turn , at no cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands were displaced by the floods a group of academics collected money , bought medicine and came here as volunteers .
despite many cases of gastroenteritis and difficulties for pregnant women , the situation seems to be under control .
complicated cases are sent to a nearby hospital that has been set up by the cricketer-cum-politician imran khan . " one thing is clear , if civil society hadn ’ t pitched in people here would be really in bad shape , " says the retired college principal syeda basheer chandio . pakistani civil society mobilized famous television hosts have also been collecting donations in their shows . " the government is helping the people , we can ’ t say they ’ re not doing anything , " says shahzad , an engineer from hyderabad who has been in the flood-affected regions with his colleague yasir for weeks . " but even the government doesn ’ t know what to do considering the massive consequences .
that ’ s why people like us from the younger generation have got involved and are supporting the government with private , non-governmental organizations .
the government can ’ t do anything alone . " what the two engineers have done is visible to the eye .
there are 450 people living in the bare bones of a stadium and each family has electricity and a ventilator .
there is television for everybody at night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of bridges were destroyed in the floods so people have to take long detours " the food is good .
there ’ s enough medicine , and water too .
we have everything we need , " says saiful , one of the inhabitants , enthusiastically . authorities want victims to go back to their villages one reason why there are shortages in the state camps is that the authorities are encouraging the flood victims to return to their villages . however , many can not and they are subjected to difficult conditions .
in a school in the village of khanote , people feel helpless because the authorities have cut off food and water supplies . " nobody listens to us , " says yusuf raza , one of the victims .
" today we even thought of blocking the streets in protest .
but then someone said we ’ re poor and who knows what could happen to us if we block the street .
what can we do ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many houses are too damaged to be reoccupied lack of democratic structures at local level the central and provincial governments have been distributing aid according to party lines and there is widespread corruption .
punhl sario , the coordinator of a local ngo , explains that the problem is that there are no democratic structures at the local level . " elections have been due for two years now but have still not taken place .
that ’ s always been the case with the pakistan people ’ s party , under zulfiqar ali bhutto and his daughter benazir , under nawaz sharif too .
whenever there is a civilian government the local elections stop .
and when there ’ s martial law , the local bodies are strengthened .
that ’ s our backwards democracy ! " he adds that foreign aid organizations should choose their pakistani partners carefully . " they should work with elected representatives here and not with the administration or the army .
there would be less corruption regarding the reconstruction even if this can not be completely avoided .
the un and the international community have to work with civil society and the grassroots .
i think oxfam ’ s approach is right – they are mobilizing volunteers all over sindh and are making a start with their own reconstruction projects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.09.2010 eastern germany is western germany 's trillion euro bet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than a paint job was needed in eastern germany german reunification , 20 years underway , has consumed billions of taxpayers ' euros in the more affluent western half of the country .
so will billions more be needed to keep the new states afloat 20 years from now ? claus uhle does n't miss the former communist german democratic republic where he grew up and worked as a mechanical engineer .
but he sure misses leipzig , his home of many years until international career moves and , more recently , his wife 's university job in dusseldorf pulled him away .
for uhle , leipzig in the eastern german state of saxony is a boom town – with plenty of work , plenty of culture and plenty of fun things to do .
saxony is one example of an eastern german state – thuringia another – that have benefited immensely from the steady flow of aid from the federal government and are now beginning to deliver a return on investment in the form of robust economic development , economists say .
such development , they agree , can only help strengthen germany 's global competitiveness .
but did reunification come too fast and cost too much ?
“ personally , i believe the process could not have happened any faster , from an economic perspective ” uhle says .
“ there were so many uncompetitive industries .
but the costs of shutting them down , of unemployment and the many recovery programs all added up quickly .
reunification has n't come cheap . ”
continuing lifeline few will disagree : an estimated 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- have flowed from the former west germany to the former east germany over the last 20 years .
and the tab is still running .
to this day , the east is gobbling up subsidies estimated between 70 and 80 billion euros a year .
that lifeline will continue for at least another nine years when funds from the solidarity pact are slated to end .
even then , structurally poor states , such as brandenburg and mecklenburg-west pomerania , can expect to receive further cash infusions through the federal state financial equalization program , which aids poorer states in the western half , including bremen , schleswig-holstein and saarland .
bildunterschrift : monetary union : east germans laughed all the way to the bank the east is n't fully to blame for being a burden on taxpayers from the west .
it was , after all , then-chancellor helmut kohl who – against the advice of financial experts – offered a monetary union for the two germanys .
overnight , wages , pensions and savings of up to 6,000 east german marks were exchanged one-to-one .
the exchange rate was intended to keep east german workers from migrating to west germany in pursuit of higher paying jobs .
but it also meant they would have to compete with the highly modern west german economy .
they could n't .
so monetary union - indirectly - eliminated hundreds of thousands of uncompetitive jobs in east germany 's car , steel , and chemicals and electronics industries .
and , today , a good chunk of the money flowing from west to east in the form of social programs continues to ease the pain caused by monetary union .
that 's not to say western german companies did n't benefit from the massive infrastructure programs and demand for consumer goods and services .
since reunification , the german government has pumped billions into public infrastructure projects such as roads , railways , waterways and airports , not to mention housing , with big construction companies from the western states being the main beneficiaries .
and western retail groups have profited from a near insatiable appetite for goods among long-deprived eastern german consumers .
good timing for the west actually , reunification came at a good time for west german industry .
prior to reunification , germany was running a huge current account surplus , meaning it was investing more abroad because it could n't find enough profitable investments at home , according to tim stuchtey , a fellow at the american institute for contemporary german studies at the john hopkins university .
that quickly changed .
“ from 1990 to 2000 , germany ran a small current account deficit because of the sucking demand from the new states , so the country was now consuming more than it was producing , ” he says .
“ and if you consider the conversation we 're having now with u.s. economists who blame germany for exporting too much and having too big a current accounts surplus , you 'll see that for 10 years , germany pursued a huge keynesian domestic investment program , which kept investments in the country . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tropical islands moved into the former hanger of cargolifter there were , however , plenty of mistakes made along the reunification path .
for example , numerous eastern german cities , often in isolated regions , used funds to build huge water recreational venues that now struggle to find paying guests .
one of them , tropical islands in brandenburg , coincidently uses as its main structure the once massive hanger built by cargolifter , another subsidized venture that had hoped to build huge industrial cargo airplanes but went bankrupt .
then there are the billions that went to renovating dwellings in inner-cities , with the backfiring effect that people fled their apartments in pre-fabricated high-rise buildings on the outskirts for nicer places in the city centers .
now many of these buildings are being torn down , again with taxpayers ' money .
“ yes , some money went to the wrong projects , ” says klaus-heiner roehl from the cologne institute for economic research .
“ but you ca n't wait 20 years to know what is right ; then nothing happens . ”
too much money for social programs ?
if infrastructure projects consumed billions of euros , social programs devoured billions more .
“ taxpayers ' money is best invested where it can achieve the most productivity and this certainly has n't been the case everywhere in eastern germany , ” says dirk dohse from the kiel institute for the world economy .
“ maybe too much money went into social programs , like the work creation program abm , which was later dropped . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl has helped turn leipzig into a leading european logistics hub there are success stories , too .
a vibrant auto manufacturing and supplier industry is flourishing in and around leipzig .
bmw and porsche have built new plants there , while opel has a huge facility in eisenach .
leipzig is emerging as a european logistics hub , thanks in large part to dhl 's expansion in the city .
elsewhere , dresden has become a top address for microelectronics , despite the downfall of one of its flagship manufacturers , qimonda , and the chemicals industry is flourishing in bitterfeld and leuna .
some numbers speak for themselves .
eastern output per capita is expected to rise to around 80 percent of western levels over the next decade , compared to around 33 percent of the west in 1991 .
and unemployment dipped below 1 million in the third quarter of 2010 for the first time since 1990 – and from a high of 1.6 million in 2003 .
demographics – a big problem still missing from the eastern german landscape , however , are big multinational companies that have located their headquarters and r & d in the area .
multinationals attract service companies , which create jobs , according to volker treier , chief economist at the german chambers of commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- .
“ the headquarters of a medium-sized company does n't have nearly as much pull as that of a multinational , ” he says .
many other challenges remain .
arguably one of the biggest is demographics .
since the fall of the berlin wall , the population of eastern germany has dropped by nearly 2 million , and there are no signs it will bounce back soon , if ever .
“ this wo n't affect the bigger cities so much but it will be a huge problem for cities of 10,000 to 50,000 people , ” treier says .
“ and when they bleed dry , that becomes a political problem . ”
despite all the hiccups that the reunification process has suffered along the way , a general mood of optimism about the future prevails among economists , academics and others tracking economic development in eastern germany .
“ like every investment , it 's a burden in the beginning when you have to finance it , ” stuchtey says .
“ but hopefully it pays off later on .
and i think the investment in eastern germany will .
we 're already seeing that . ”

jane bealby and mike gaunt both separately contacted presenter andy whittaker with the idea .
the presenter mentioned this on his breakfast show and he was overwhelmed with the level of positive response .
andy whittaker said : " listeners to the show have really embraced the idea , ringing in to bbc radio nottingham and sending in their designs . "
many other counties already have a flag , amongst them lincolnshire , cornwall , devon , yorkshire and derbyshire but there is not currently a flag for nottinghamshire registered with the flag institute .
although there is an unofficial design on the internet , most callers to the show thought that something new was needed .
the flag institute advice for creating a county flag is that it should be simple , representative of nottinghamshire , and it should not contain words or detailed pictures .
bbc radio nottingham is setting up a ' design panel ' to sort through the many design ideas that have been submitted .
the panel will then come up with three final potential designs .
what do you think about having an official flag for the county ?
if you like the idea , what should be on it ?
have a look at the suggested nottinghamshire flag designs , fill in the form below and tell andy whittaker what you think .
if you think you can do better send in your designs to andy.whittaker @ bbc.co.uk the flag should be the old motif from home ales .
it was a picture of robin hood at full stretch with his bow .
ian from sherwood the outline of the flag should be the shape of nottinghamshire , with the bow and arrow incorporated into this .
maurice from aspley plain white flag with a big green robin hood , simplicity is key !
irene from chilwell why not have brian clough on the front , an emblem of sherwood forest and the city ground on the back .
bruce from west bridgford look at the notts fire service 's flag .
that has everything that represents the county .
dave from beeston if there is to be a county flag it must have the union jack within it , the eu flag must not be in this flag .
john from bulwell we used to have a county flag before the county brought in the n symbol , it was of an oak tree which obviously tied in with robin hood .
i do n't believe that we fly our flags enough as it is , the union jack and st george 's flags should be flying high in many more places .
ian from costock nottingham flag green-gold and should have robin hood as an emblem !
maybe a few trees to represent sherwood forest .
jan in arnold perhaps it should have the oak tree made of nottingham lace where the leaves and branches could be see-through as part of the design .
gina , nottingham straight forward black and white stripes with a magpie in the middle .
what else do we need for a flag ?
phil the unofficial flag is like a kiddies drawing .
let us have a nice traditional one with stags and the castle on .
richard as a born and bred ex-pat nottinghamian now resident in lincolnshire i must say i very much prefer the flags by ivor munn and thomas randall .
they are basic , simple and straight to the point and also easy to draw or copy .
they both convey and represent the spirit and history of nottingham through their colour choice .
tony beardsley although i have already done a design i must say i find all the others of excellent standard .
anthony david beardsley i quite like mike gaunt 's design with the robin hood figure in the middle .
simple and neat .
andy ward i like john 's with the forest badge , as this is the most recognisable image of nottingham .
and , of course , it is of a lone tree , like the major oak .
his flag is also very simple and , like notts , has the river trent running through it .
jim , nottingham good to see so many people making a contribution to the debate about the flag for nottingham .
i am personally in favour of a flag .
it need n't cost the earth and it would make a positive statement about our county and city .
i particularly liked the one designed by richard odams .
it is bold , clear and represents nottingham being in the country of england .
maureen mernick , arnold i think a nottinghamshire flag is a great idea .
and , like mel , i remember the metal car badges of the 1950s - great fun !
of the designs submitted so far i think the one from thomas randall is the best .
it is simple but highly colourful and , does n't rely on any one icon to represent the county .
andrea willis the simple flag such as richard odams ' ... red , green and robin hood .
it would look good .
anita arnold wanted to say thank you to those who have commented on my flag design .
other than my design i really like thomas randall 's flag .
i think it is bright and bold and would look great flag across nottinghamshire .
richard odams i think that it is a brilliant idea to put nottinghamshire on the map as it seems we are being left behind by other counties .
as i previously mentioned i work in derby and regularly see their flag flying and a lot of cars have the flag car sticker in them too .
i do n't like the unofficial flag on your website - that design is awful .
mark dack just heard about this county flag idea , here is my suggestion .
white background , printed as nottingham lace .
large green silhouette of oak tree .
gold line drawing of robin hood archer within a tree .
it may be simple but nothing says " nottinghamshire " more than that , in my opinion .
brian smedley , mansfield i do n't like the unofficial flag .
it looks like a yellow fungi or a genetically modified daffodil .
pathetic .
who commissioned it ?
thank you for bringing it to the attention of nottingham people , hopefully we can pull it around and rally around a flag we can all be proud of .
big ian , forest fields your idea about a flag for nottinghamshire takes me back to the late 1950s when i was a child .
in those days you were proud of the county you were born in and a lot of people had a metal badge fitted to their car which had the county name and some form of coat of arms / motif depicting the county .
it was great fun when we were on holiday in devon / dorset trying to recognise cars from leicestershire , where i lived at the time .
mel pearson , mansfield nottinghamshire is within england , therefore the england flag as background , with a worldwide recognised symbol of nottinghamshire superimposed .
now , what symbol of notts is recognised the wide world over ?
robin hood is a great symbol of our area .
use him .
we all keep ranting about promoting robin hood , what better way to do this ?
we should be flaunting him on a flag , wearing him proudly on a t-shirt , displaying him proudly as a logo on anything .
legend !
the only other thing that i feel is important to notts is the tree / forest - specifically the major oak , but let 's not crowd the flag .
it 's the oak or robin .
lynne pearson i 've just been listening to you talk about " the big night out " and the fact that the purple flag will be raised - i think the nottinghamshire flag that you are campaigning for should have purple and green as the colours to depict this .
we need to hold onto these accolades when we have been given them !
rachael rymell , sutton i like richard odams design best .
its simple and features robin hood .
robert hare , arnold i like the ones with a white back ground , not green as it will show up more .
we need a red cross of st george and we have to have robin hood on it as that 's what nottinghamshire is known for all over the world .
marlene shaw , huthwaite nottingham had a flag on display at the battle of agincourt in 1415 .
why not re-use it ?
let 's be prouud of our history .
brian benison , forest town apart from my own design the red cross on a green background and the green cross on white background are the ones i like the best .
tony field , mansfield like the one with green background , red cross and green archer best .
john cranfield , bingham i like the design by richard odams .
i love the green background to a simple red st george 's cross .
maybe the centre crest could incorporate robin hood 's arrow , a blue bar -lrb- for the trent -rrb- and a simplistic edge of lace instead of just the cameo of robin himself .
lynn wilson , mansfield i think a flag for the county is a excellent idea .
looking at the flags already submitted i love the flag with the robin hood logo in the middle .
i think it would certainly give nottingham the closeness it has lost in previous years .
james j brookshaw , arnold i already fly the unofficial flag when out and about with my caravan and it gets a lot of interest .
let us fly the flag for nottinghamshire .
john williams , eastwood no flag at all .
we can not afford it at this time and no-one would make proper use of it .
we have a county council who butchered the last one , nottingham city council who would not use it and we in the rest of the county do not need it .
what nottinghamshire needs to do is get a tourist board to promote robin hood , but it needs a theme park and hotels in and around edwinstowe .
change the county name to robin hood shire .

but the 10 x 12cm gift is much more than a simple festive present .
it was carved by german prisoner of war otto krasch for the family - who do not want to be named - and they donated it to honiton 's all hallow museum in 2005 .
and the museum 's curator margaret lewis has now uploaded the object to the bbc 's a history of the world website .
she said she chose to submit it as part of the bbc project because it was such a " poignant " item .
otto was one of many prisoners of war who were kept at heathfield camp in honiton after the end of the second world war .
" but we do n't know why , " said margaret .
otto krasch 's hobbies were carving and pokerwork the pows were taken to surrounding farms each day in a lorry and a number of them eventually ended up living at the farms before returning to germany in 1946/7 .
otto was working at the farm at dalwood and made the items in his spare time at the camp , as christmas gifts for members of the family .
" otto made several gifts for the family , " said margaret .
" the lady still has a wooden plaque , postcard size , with the inscription - ' nordsüdostwesten haus ist am besten ' which means ' north , south , east , west , home is best ' .
" he also made a sewing basket for her and for a girl that worked on the farm at the time , decorated with cross stitch . "
after otto returned to germany to his job - building the autobahn - the families stayed in touch , sending each other christmas cards .
carving and pokerwork - the art of making pictures or patterns on wood using a series of deep grooves made by heated pokers - were his hobbies .
" i have hundreds of favourite items in the museum collection , " said margaret .
" but i chose this piece because i feel it is so unusual and also it is so poignant that a young man - a prisoner of war in honiton - a small rural market town in devon , undoubtedly missing his own family very much at christmas , took the time and trouble to make gifts for the family that he worked for post-war .
