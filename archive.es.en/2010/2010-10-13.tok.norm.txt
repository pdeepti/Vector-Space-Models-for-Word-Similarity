but they are n't expected to approve a more controversial proposal on a congestion charge .
the ministers have been discussing changes to the directive for more than two years .
among the contentious issues : charging truckers for environmental damage , which is n't mandatory under the current legislation .
air and noise pollution the new rules would require truck operators to pay for the air and noise pollution caused by their vehicles , in addition to the tolls they 're already paying for road building and repair .
the additional costs could be as high as 0.5 euro cents per kilometer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truckers already pay a toll to use german autobahns germany already has a toll system for heavy goods vehicles and currently charges between 17 and 18 cents per kilometer , according to adolf zobel , managing director of the german freight and waste trucking association -lrb- bgl -rrb- .
a part of the fee goes to air and noise pollution infrastructure measures such as noise-reducing asphalt and noise retention walls , he told deutsche welle .
while zobel acknowledges the reasons for charging a pollution fee , he objects to the current proposal that would allow eu member states to decide how the revenue should be spent .
" we say it must go entirely to infrastructure , including air and noise pollution measures ; roads need to have their own financing system , " he said .
" but brussels is considering allowing member states to use the money as they please . "
bgl and nearly all other european trucking associations object to the proposed road congestion charge .
and they 're not alone .
numerous national governments , worried about compounding truckers ' expenses , oppose the plan as well to win them over , the eu has weakened the proposal .
under a compromise now on the table , any congestion fee would have to be " revenue neutral " .
that means if national authorities , for instance , charge truckers higher tolls to use roads in peak hours , then they would have to reduce off-peak tolls by the same amount .
all watered down " a big problem with the revenue-neutral idea is that a lot of truckers really ca n't decide at what time of the day they can drive , " zobel said .
" that decision is often made by their customers . "
nor are environmental groups excited about the current proposal – but for a completely different reason .
" everything has been watered down , " said nina renshaw , deputy director of transport and environment , an organization that promotes the " polluter-pays " principle .
" it 's really important that congestion be part of the new directive . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congestion is a popular word in germany around vacation time congestion , she told deutsche welle , is a significant contributor to both air and noise pollution , so a mandatory fee aimed at reducing it only makes sense .
the eurovignette directive was first adopted in 1993 .
it was revised in 2006 before member states ’ squabbling over further changes brought talks to a standstill in 2008 .
the directive was put back on the european policy agenda by belgium , which has taken over the six-month rotating presidency of the council of the eu .
if the transportation ministers reach an agreement on amending the directive , then the proposed legislation must go to the european parliament for final approval .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 13.10.2010 hochtief prepares defense against spanish takeover bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction giant hochtief employs 55,000 people spain 's acs construction has grown rapidly in recent years , and is seeking to expand further by acquiring germany 's hochtief .
meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

islam and muslims are met with particular reservations . the study released wednesday called " right-wing extremism in germany 2010 " argues that extreme views have penetrated to the heart of german society .

for example , 32 percent approve of the statement that " when there 's a shortage of jobs , foreigners should be sent back home ; " 34 percent agree or strongly agree with the statement that " foreigners only come here to exploit germany 's social welfare system ; " and 35 percent think that " germany has a dangerous level of foreign influence as a result of the many foreigners in the country .

"
but extreme views turned into majority opinions when it came to islam , with 55 percent saying they could understand that people find arabs unpleasant , and 58 percent saying that the practice of the muslim religion should be " considerably restricted . "
indeed , an absolute majority of those who otherwise did not hold extremist views agreed with these two statements .
the survey was carried out in april , before the latest controversy over the role of islam in german society .
the researchers have carried out a similar survey every two years since 2002 , and , after the figures for 2008 -lrb- during an economic boom -rrb- turned out to be considerably lower than those of the years before , this year 's figures have returned roughly to the norm .
although the researchers argue that the survey proves that right-wing extremist views have reached the " middle " of society , their own figures show that such views are far more prevalent among the elderly , the poorly educated and the unemployed .

meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

if the trials are successful , the eurostar monoply on the route could become a thing of the past . a train belonging to german rail operator deutsche bahn entered the channel tunnel that connects england with mainland europe for the first time on wednesday .
the ice3 train , built by the german company siemens , threatens to rival the monopoly held by the french-built eurostar train . since the trains still lack approval for the route between france and britain , they were pulled by a locomotive .
on board were staff from deutsche bahn and tunnel operator eurotunnel plus a technical team , but no passengers .
end of an era ?
the ice train was the first passenger train not operated by eurostar to use the tunnel , after eu rules required the tunnel be opened to competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurostar trains have had a monopoly on the tunnel france , which owns 55 percent of the cross-channel eurostar service , has reacted angrily to the company decision last week to buy trains worth about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 836 million -rrb- from siemens , rather than the french company alstom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 13.10.2010 american fiction is germany 's preferred bedtime reading großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jonathan franzen is promoting his new book " freedom " in germany us writer jonathan franzen is currently promoting his latest bestselling novel in germany , where - for a variety of reasons - american writers tend to outsell home-grown talent . jonathan franzen has been having a hard time of it recently .
first , he had his spectacles stolen at a launch party in london for his new novel " freedom . "
then it transpired that the wrong draft of the book had been published in britain and an entire print run of 80,000 copies had to be pulped . but the rapturous reception he was given at the frankfurt book fair last week no doubt provided some comfort .
" he was surrounded by an entourage of admirers wherever he went , " said german author and illustrator nadia budde , who was there to pick up a german youth literature award . the media circus has continued to dog him on his current reading tour .
the interest he 's generating is no surprise given how well " freedom , " which took him nine years to complete , is doing in germany .
when it was published in translation last month , it shot straight into the top five on the spiegel bestseller list and his readings this week are all sold out . dead or - very much - alive ? not least because franzen spent time in berlin as a fulbright scholar , germany has always had a very soft spot for him .
but not only him - a visit to any german bookstore provides ample evidence that readers in the land of " poets and thinkers " ca n't seem to get enough of american fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the novel dead ?
" people here take literature very seriously , " franzen told journalists in frankfurt over the weekend . but why specifically american literature , especially when many believe it 's seen better days ?
us critic lee siegel triggered a storm of controversy this summer when he pronounced the american novel dead in an article for the new york observer . " fiction has become culturally irrelevant , " he railed .
" for about a million reasons , fiction has now become a museum-piece genre , most of whose practitioners are more like cripplingly self-conscious curators or theoreticians than writers . " german readers beg to differ .
" contemporary us literature is just more diverse and original than its german equivalent , " observed heinz ickstadt from the john f. kennedy institute for north american studies in berlin . the rock-n-roll factor a big fan of american writers , nadia budde feels that they have a lightness of touch that their german counterparts lack - and that in comparison , german fiction is indeed a " museum-piece genre . " " you can always see how carefully -lsb- german -rsb- novels have been constructed , polished and controlled , " she said , pointing to writers such as daniel kehlmann , " whereas there 's something very rock and roll about novels by us writers like franzen , jeffrey eugenides , michael chabon and david foster wallace .
they have something unbridled about them , something very free and easy , effortless , cool and crazy - something that germans long to have but just do n't . " like many of his contemporaries , franzen certainly writes with a visceral edge .
" my idea of a novel is something that has an emotional impact , so what i do is to go to the places where we feel the strongest emotions , " said franzen .
" -lsb- as a writer -rsb- you try and get energy going in a book , and you reach for the content that has its own intrinsic energy .
what you want is to make the pages come alive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us authors are edgier than their german counterparts he and his peers can make german writing look very heavy-handed - especially when it 's aiming for humor .
" as close as it is to reality , us literature is not as naked and stark - reading contemporary german writing can sometimes feel like having things pointed out to you under a neon light , " said budde . love-hate relationship with the us what also makes germany such an enthusiastic market for us writers is the innate familiarity to germans of today 's america .
even though the trans-atlantic relationship suffered during the bush administration , to germany the us still represents the new world .
over the years , it 's lost none of its sheen . " despite all the criticism that exists against the us , it 's still the land of opportunity to us , " said budde , " not just in terms of money and success , but also as a country that 's home to an incredible mix of nationalities . "
historically , of course , it 's also a country where immigrants could reinvent themselves and shrug off their past . so while us writers like franzen and john irving are happy to wear influences such as stendhal , dickens and tolstoy on their sleeves , they also manage to create what franzen calls " enveloping narratives " that take on their own momentum . in contrast , " contemporary german writers just seem so very weighed down by european history and literary classics , " observed budde . but ultimately , the dominance of us fiction in the german book market could also have more prosaic reasons .
in literature as in cinema , it 's america that calls the shots in germany . " it has a lot to do with the structure of book markets , " said heinz ickstadt .
" big names inevitably work their magic , and the german book market does n't want to be seen to be limping behind when it comes to getting out the latest thomas pynchon or richard powers .
potential bestsellers are always going to be a temptation . " author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the iranian govermnent said they were trying to interview the son of a woman sentenced to death by stoning . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said wednesday that he was doing all he could to secure the release of two journalists arrested in iran for interviewing " counter-revolutionaries " whilst on tourist visas .
" we are working with urgency to resolve this case , " westerwelle said .
he confirmed that the arrested men were german citizens , and that germany was still trying to contact them .
iran 's judiciary said on monday that the two were detained after interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , the iranian woman whose stoning sentence was shelved last month following a global outcry .
working for release westerwelle has appealed to his iranian counterpart , manuscher mottaki , to personally take up the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has asked his iranian counterpart to intervene " we are working on all diplomatic levels and using all diplomatic channels to pursue the freeing of these two germans and returning them to germany as soon as possible , " westerwelle said .
the two detainees have not been named and it is not clear who they were working for .
initial reports suggested they may have been working for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper .
hendrik zoerner , the spokesperson of the german journalists trade union , djv , said he contacted the newspaper for more information after the arrests were made public .
" at that time , their public stance was that they could not confirm or deny the reports .
and so we still do n't know who it was or who they were working for , " zoerner said .
some sources say the pair were a reporter and a photographer .
risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders calls iran 's media censorship ' disturbing ' the iranian government has accused the men of breaking iranian law by doing research without official accreditation . iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast also said the two germans were working with anti-revolutionary networks abroad .
" an anti-revolutionary group based in germany made the preparations for these two people to refer to ms mohammadi 's son , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast told a weekly news conference on tuesday .
doing journalistic research in iran on a tourist visa is very dangerous , says , zoerner . " iran is not a free country and has been trying for years to hinder journalists who are practicing their profession . if you 're caught doing research there as a tourist , you 're taking a huge risk , " zoerner said .

the new rules are part of president nicolas sarkozy 's law and order crackdown .
the bill calls for any foreign-born citizens naturalized for less than 10 years to be stripped of their citizenship if convicted of violent crimes against police officers or other public officials .
this punishment currently applies only to terrorism charges .
the new measures would also allow the police to deport foreign nationals , including those from other eu countries , for repeated acts of theft , aggressive begging , or for illegally occupying land - a move that appears to target foreign-born roma gypsies living in france .
in addition , the new law will make it easier to expel any foreigner who is considered a burden on france 's social welfare system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson wants ' good french citizens ' sarkozy 's government drew condemnation from eu officials in recent months for rounding up hundreds of roma from illegal camps and deporting them to romania and bulgaria .
immigration minister eric besson , who proposed the new rules , said he wanted a “ mechanism for producing good french citizens . ”
he hailed the measures , which passed comfortably in the first reading , 294-239 , calling the vote “ a big first step in the building of a european immigration policy . ”
critics , however , claim that the plan will make second-class citizens of immigrants who obtain french nationality .
the draft legislation still has to be put before the senate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 13.10.2010 social services still struggling to break through to uk muslim youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups aim to help muslim boys and girls young british muslims are still reluctant to get the help they need from mainstream counseling services for fear of being misunderstood , says the muslim youth helpline , which helps young muslims cope with their issues . an organization in britain has set out to offer a support service to young muslims who are without a shoulder to lean on .
but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

but they are n't expected to approve a more controversial proposal on a congestion charge .
the ministers have been discussing changes to the directive for more than two years .
among the contentious issues : charging truckers for environmental damage , which is n't mandatory under the current legislation .
air and noise pollution the new rules would require truck operators to pay for the air and noise pollution caused by their vehicles , in addition to the tolls they 're already paying for road building and repair .
the additional costs could be as high as 0.5 euro cents per kilometer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truckers already pay a toll to use german autobahns germany already has a toll system for heavy goods vehicles and currently charges between 17 and 18 cents per kilometer , according to adolf zobel , managing director of the german freight and waste trucking association -lrb- bgl -rrb- .
a part of the fee goes to air and noise pollution infrastructure measures such as noise-reducing asphalt and noise retention walls , he told deutsche welle .
while zobel acknowledges the reasons for charging a pollution fee , he objects to the current proposal that would allow eu member states to decide how the revenue should be spent .
" we say it must go entirely to infrastructure , including air and noise pollution measures ; roads need to have their own financing system , " he said .
" but brussels is considering allowing member states to use the money as they please . "
bgl and nearly all other european trucking associations object to the proposed road congestion charge .
and they 're not alone .
numerous national governments , worried about compounding truckers ' expenses , oppose the plan as well to win them over , the eu has weakened the proposal .
under a compromise now on the table , any congestion fee would have to be " revenue neutral " .
that means if national authorities , for instance , charge truckers higher tolls to use roads in peak hours , then they would have to reduce off-peak tolls by the same amount .
all watered down " a big problem with the revenue-neutral idea is that a lot of truckers really ca n't decide at what time of the day they can drive , " zobel said .
" that decision is often made by their customers . "
nor are environmental groups excited about the current proposal – but for a completely different reason .
" everything has been watered down , " said nina renshaw , deputy director of transport and environment , an organization that promotes the " polluter-pays " principle .
" it 's really important that congestion be part of the new directive . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congestion is a popular word in germany around vacation time congestion , she told deutsche welle , is a significant contributor to both air and noise pollution , so a mandatory fee aimed at reducing it only makes sense .
the eurovignette directive was first adopted in 1993 .
it was revised in 2006 before member states ’ squabbling over further changes brought talks to a standstill in 2008 .
the directive was put back on the european policy agenda by belgium , which has taken over the six-month rotating presidency of the council of the eu .
if the transportation ministers reach an agreement on amending the directive , then the proposed legislation must go to the european parliament for final approval .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will ' justify ' the un 's ' vote of confidence ' germany , on tuesday , won election to one of two non-permanent seats on the un security council assigned to western nations .
portugal was awarded the other seat , after canada withdrew its bid following two inconclusive rounds of voting .
all three nations had campaigned to represent the regional area called western europe and other groups -lrb- weog -rrb- . foreign minister westerwelle called the un 's selection a " significant vote of confidence " and pledged to " do everything possible to justify the confidence shown in us by the united nations . "
westerwelle , who was in new york to support germany 's bid , told reporters : " the world knows that it can count on germany .
we are now faced with the responsibility to establish peace , security and development around the globe . " the german victory is expected to boost the country 's new campaign to become a permanent member on the council .
chancellor angela merkel said in berlin that the government was delighted with the results . " germany will work hard during its term to push ahead on reforms of the un security council , " she said .
" that is the expectation that a lot of people in the world have . " more permanent members but reform of the united nations is a major issue on germany 's agenda .
westerwelle recently met counterparts from japan , india and brazil to discuss launching a reform campaign .
the so-called g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats . " today 's security council reflects the world 's power architecture after world war ii .
it should reflect the power structure of today 's world , " westerwelle said . the security council is the main global body charged with keeping international peace .
it has 15 members : the five permanent members russia , china , the us , britain and france , who have the right to veto any council resolution , and 10 non-permanent members .
each of these rotating countries stays on the council for two years . bildunterschrift : the other three non-permanent seats at stake this year had already been decided by virtue of being uncontested : india will take over from japan for the asian region , colombia takes mexico 's seat for latin america and south africa takes the place of uganda for africa .
each of the five new non-permanent members is to take up its seat on the security council on jan .
1 , 2011 . juergen chrobog , a former senior official in the foreign ministry and german ambassador to the us , told german radio ahead of the vote that germany wanted more participation in decisions . " we take on a lot of responsibility as important partners in un peace missions , " chrobog said . " more than 6,300 german troops are stationed in areas of conflict all over the world , particularly in afghanistan and the balkans , as well as hundreds of police officers .
if a country sends its citizens to these regions , it wants to have a say in decisions that lead to a deployment .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister urges google to disclose opt-out numbers german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is urging the internet giant google to disclose the number of people who have chosen to opt out of its street view service .
she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue .

the chancellor 's own home will be among the millions shown by the online mapping service .

but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

it would be a false conclusion to assume that germany 's non-permanent seat brings it closer to a permanent seat .

when the threat of floods or droughts forces people to abandon their home country , climate change will become an issue of national security for many nations .
the year 2012 presents an opportunity for germans to advance another issue that is particularly close to their foreign minister 's heart : disarmament and an end to the conflict in the middle east .
a conference is planned , which is meant to approve the establishment of a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region .
that 's a tender subject , because the entire world assumes that israel possesses nuclear weapons without openly acknowledging it , and israel is one of three states that has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
one can only guess where things will go with iran in the nuclear conflict .
in this area , germany has already been involved in negotiations along with the five veto-wielding powers , so far without success . in any case , germany can cast a vote on all resolutions for the next two years .
bildunterschrift : the security council 's structure makes any reform near impossible germany will do well to vote alongside the other european countries on all important decisions .
a seat for the european union , which the coalition agreement between the chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats envisions , is nowhere near becoming a reality .
and that 's ultimately for the best .
in crisis situations , the security council must be able to make decisions quickly .
and the european union is certainly not able to send a representative who would be capable of doing that , at least not yet .
it would be a false conclusion to assume that germany 's non-permanent seat brings it closer to a permanent seat .
efforts to reform the security council have hit a dead end , since the veto-wielding powers have no interest in reducing their own influence .
so over the next two years , germany should focus on the achievable .
and as a non-colonial power , it should advocate for the underrepresented interests of africa , latin america and asia .
then it will have used its seat on the council wisely .

the new rules are part of president nicolas sarkozy 's law and order crackdown .
the bill calls for any foreign-born citizens naturalized for less than 10 years to be stripped of their citizenship if convicted of violent crimes against police officers or other public officials .
this punishment currently applies only to terrorism charges .
the new measures would also allow the police to deport foreign nationals , including those from other eu countries , for repeated acts of theft , aggressive begging , or for illegally occupying land - a move that appears to target foreign-born roma gypsies living in france .
in addition , the new law will make it easier to expel any foreigner who is considered a burden on france 's social welfare system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson wants ' good french citizens ' sarkozy 's government drew condemnation from eu officials in recent months for rounding up hundreds of roma from illegal camps and deporting them to romania and bulgaria .
immigration minister eric besson , who proposed the new rules , said he wanted a “ mechanism for producing good french citizens . ”
he hailed the measures , which passed comfortably in the first reading , 294-239 , calling the vote “ a big first step in the building of a european immigration policy . ”
critics , however , claim that the plan will make second-class citizens of immigrants who obtain french nationality .
the draft legislation still has to be put before the senate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 13.10.2010 uk startup ' internet eyes ' crowdsources retail surveillance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk is notorious for its use of cctv cameras for a small monthly fee , uk shop owners can have their surveillance cameras watched by internet users eager to catch shoplifters for a cash reward .
but some internet experts liken the concept to outsourcing police work . the united kingdom is notorious for its widespread use of cctv surveillance cameras .
now , a new internet startup is adding a twist to the privacy debate by bringing live streams of footage to viewers online .
devon-based " internet eyes " hopes to profit by rewarding internet users who spot and report shoplifters .
the rewards can be as much as 1,000 british pounds -lrb- 1,144 euros -rrb- , and internet privacy and civil liberties advocates describe the system as a privatization of law enforcement .
internet eyes went online on october 4 , and its founder , tony morgan , said the site has garnered more than 1,000 viewers who have reported more than 135 possible incidents .
the site prevents voyeurism by anonymizing feeds , which are switched every 20 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk has a long history of monitoring the public with cctv cameras " you ca n't use internet eyes for voyeuristic pleasures , " morgan told deutsche welle .
" we 've made sure that there 's no way this can be done .
with internet eyes you do n't know where you 're watching . "
service fee for businesses when a user reports suspicious activity , a text message is sent to two mobile phone numbers selected by the store owner .
it is then followed by a picture message of what was on the camera at the time .
immediately after reporting activity , users are transferred to a new feed so they ca n't see what transpires in the store .
internet eyes plans to make its money by charging a 75 pound monthly fee to storeowners who subscribe to the service , making it significantly less expensive than hiring a security guard .
the company is providing its service free of charge for three months in the uk in the hopes winning over customers .
" it 's very , very inexpensive , " morgan said .
" if a retailer does n't lose more than that -lrb- to shoplifting -rrb- during the course of a month , then he does n't need our service .
but that 's highly unlikely . "
morgan says the uk 's information commissioner 's office withdrew its initial objections to the service after internet eyes agreed to charge users a nominal fee to prevent abuse and limit itself to the european union .
likely to struggle on the european level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say cctv cameras are ineffective and intrusive but viktor mayer-schoenberger of the oxford internet institute says he believes internet eyes will run into trouble when it butts against the european union 's data protection directive .
" keep in mind that there is a huge risk , given the fact that no data protection commissioner has ruled on this as far as i can tell , " he told deutsche welle .
" they spoke with information commissioner 's office , but that does n't mean anything . "
the eu data protection directive creates a " minimum standard " for countries to meet , meaning what is legal in the uk might not be legal elsewhere , according to mayer-schoenberger .
" it 's an obvious solution given the power of crowdsourcing and internet economics – namely the fact that there are so many eyeballs out there on the net that can be brought to good use , " he said .
could foster bias and suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been abuses of over aggressive surveillance in the german corporate environment but regardless of internet eyes ' legal status , mayer-schoenberger objects to the service because of the social precedent it sets .
he sees it as the outsourcing of a law enforcement function to amateur private citizens , who have a higher likelihood of biases such as racial profiling .
" just pressing the button actually causes this scene to be investigated further , " he said " that 's pretty powerful , i 'd say .
that means i can direct the attention of law enforcement to something i find suspicious .
that 's a pretty powerful position . ”
mayer-schoenberger also said internet eyes ' built-in reward structure caters to suspicion and a host of other societal problems .
" from a business sense it makes perfect sense , " he said .
" from a legal perspective , whether or not its legal depends on complicated issues .
from a societal perspective , i 'd be extremely cautious . "
experts say cctv ineffective according to ross anderson , a professor of security engineering at the university of cambridge , cctv has been shown in research to be ineffective .
he described himself as being " shocked but not surprised " by the launch of internet eyes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of internet eyes says he 's helping small shopkeepers " it works in car parks , but almost nowhere else , " he wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" so in the long run , i expect this business to fail .
in the short run , it 's a symptom of the way in which many englishmen were persuaded to abandon their liberties one by one under both thatcher and blair .
so we might be thankful that policy in europe is also made by countries like germany , poland and lithuania , with more recent memories of oppression than we have . "
anderson pointed out that the united kingdom is currently being taken to court by the european commission for failing to effectively implement the data protection directive .
protects independent businesses but morgan argues his company 's service helps small , independent retailers , many of whom ca n't afford to hire security guards and are struggling to maintain their place in the commercial landscape .
" is n't it time we started to look after the independent retail chap instead of looking after the people that rob him ? " he said .
" we do so much to protect those that do the stealing , yet nothing for the poor chap who is trying to make a living . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 13.10.2010 uk startup ' internet eyes ' crowdsources retail surveillance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk is notorious for its use of cctv cameras for a small monthly fee , uk shop owners can have their surveillance cameras watched by internet users eager to catch shoplifters for a cash reward .
but some internet experts liken the concept to outsourcing police work . the united kingdom is notorious for its widespread use of cctv surveillance cameras .
now , a new internet startup is adding a twist to the privacy debate by bringing live streams of footage to viewers online .
devon-based " internet eyes " hopes to profit by rewarding internet users who spot and report shoplifters .
the rewards can be as much as 1,000 british pounds -lrb- 1,144 euros -rrb- , and internet privacy and civil liberties advocates describe the system as a privatization of law enforcement .
internet eyes went online on october 4 , and its founder , tony morgan , said the site has garnered more than 1,000 viewers who have reported more than 135 possible incidents .
the site prevents voyeurism by anonymizing feeds , which are switched every 20 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk has a long history of monitoring the public with cctv cameras " you ca n't use internet eyes for voyeuristic pleasures , " morgan told deutsche welle .
" we 've made sure that there 's no way this can be done .
with internet eyes you do n't know where you 're watching . "
service fee for businesses when a user reports suspicious activity , a text message is sent to two mobile phone numbers selected by the store owner .
it is then followed by a picture message of what was on the camera at the time .
immediately after reporting activity , users are transferred to a new feed so they ca n't see what transpires in the store .
internet eyes plans to make its money by charging a 75 pound monthly fee to storeowners who subscribe to the service , making it significantly less expensive than hiring a security guard .
the company is providing its service free of charge for three months in the uk in the hopes winning over customers .
" it 's very , very inexpensive , " morgan said .
" if a retailer does n't lose more than that -lrb- to shoplifting -rrb- during the course of a month , then he does n't need our service .
but that 's highly unlikely . "
morgan says the uk 's information commissioner 's office withdrew its initial objections to the service after internet eyes agreed to charge users a nominal fee to prevent abuse and limit itself to the european union .
likely to struggle on the european level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say cctv cameras are ineffective and intrusive but viktor mayer-schoenberger of the oxford internet institute says he believes internet eyes will run into trouble when it butts against the european union 's data protection directive .
" keep in mind that there is a huge risk , given the fact that no data protection commissioner has ruled on this as far as i can tell , " he told deutsche welle .
" they spoke with information commissioner 's office , but that does n't mean anything . "
the eu data protection directive creates a " minimum standard " for countries to meet , meaning what is legal in the uk might not be legal elsewhere , according to mayer-schoenberger .
" it 's an obvious solution given the power of crowdsourcing and internet economics – namely the fact that there are so many eyeballs out there on the net that can be brought to good use , " he said .
could foster bias and suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been abuses of over aggressive surveillance in the german corporate environment but regardless of internet eyes ' legal status , mayer-schoenberger objects to the service because of the social precedent it sets .
he sees it as the outsourcing of a law enforcement function to amateur private citizens , who have a higher likelihood of biases such as racial profiling .
" just pressing the button actually causes this scene to be investigated further , " he said " that 's pretty powerful , i 'd say .
that means i can direct the attention of law enforcement to something i find suspicious .
that 's a pretty powerful position . ”
mayer-schoenberger also said internet eyes ' built-in reward structure caters to suspicion and a host of other societal problems .
" from a business sense it makes perfect sense , " he said .
" from a legal perspective , whether or not its legal depends on complicated issues .
from a societal perspective , i 'd be extremely cautious . "
experts say cctv ineffective according to ross anderson , a professor of security engineering at the university of cambridge , cctv has been shown in research to be ineffective .
he described himself as being " shocked but not surprised " by the launch of internet eyes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of internet eyes says he 's helping small shopkeepers " it works in car parks , but almost nowhere else , " he wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" so in the long run , i expect this business to fail .
in the short run , it 's a symptom of the way in which many englishmen were persuaded to abandon their liberties one by one under both thatcher and blair .
so we might be thankful that policy in europe is also made by countries like germany , poland and lithuania , with more recent memories of oppression than we have . "
anderson pointed out that the united kingdom is currently being taken to court by the european commission for failing to effectively implement the data protection directive .
protects independent businesses but morgan argues his company 's service helps small , independent retailers , many of whom ca n't afford to hire security guards and are struggling to maintain their place in the commercial landscape .
" is n't it time we started to look after the independent retail chap instead of looking after the people that rob him ? " he said .
" we do so much to protect those that do the stealing , yet nothing for the poor chap who is trying to make a living . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : debate surrounds google 's plans for street view in germany deadline looms for germans to blur homes from google street view why oberstaufen , a southern german town , supports google street view google responds to street view criticism in germany google seeks to ease german opposition to street view privacy -pipe- 13.10.2010 street view brings privacy debate to german mainstream , blogger says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view made privacy a concern of millions of germans street view represents germany 's first real discussion about online privacy , said markus beckedahl , editor of the influential blog netzpolitik .
but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister urges google to disclose opt-out numbers german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is urging the internet giant google to disclose the number of people who have chosen to opt out of its street view service .
she has demanded " more transparency " on the issue .

meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 13.10.2010 social services still struggling to break through to uk muslim youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups aim to help muslim boys and girls young british muslims are still reluctant to get the help they need from mainstream counseling services for fear of being misunderstood , says the muslim youth helpline , which helps young muslims cope with their issues . an organization in britain has set out to offer a support service to young muslims who are without a shoulder to lean on .
but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

the iranian govermnent said they were trying to interview the son of a woman sentenced to death by stoning . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said wednesday that he was doing all he could to secure the release of two journalists arrested in iran for interviewing " counter-revolutionaries " whilst on tourist visas .
" we are working with urgency to resolve this case , " westerwelle said .
he confirmed that the arrested men were german citizens , and that germany was still trying to contact them .
iran 's judiciary said on monday that the two were detained after interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , the iranian woman whose stoning sentence was shelved last month following a global outcry .
working for release westerwelle has appealed to his iranian counterpart , manuscher mottaki , to personally take up the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has asked his iranian counterpart to intervene " we are working on all diplomatic levels and using all diplomatic channels to pursue the freeing of these two germans and returning them to germany as soon as possible , " westerwelle said .
the two detainees have not been named and it is not clear who they were working for .
initial reports suggested they may have been working for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper .
hendrik zoerner , the spokesperson of the german journalists trade union , djv , said he contacted the newspaper for more information after the arrests were made public .
" at that time , their public stance was that they could not confirm or deny the reports .
and so we still do n't know who it was or who they were working for , " zoerner said .
some sources say the pair were a reporter and a photographer .
risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders calls iran 's media censorship ' disturbing ' the iranian government has accused the men of breaking iranian law by doing research without official accreditation . iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast also said the two germans were working with anti-revolutionary networks abroad .
" an anti-revolutionary group based in germany made the preparations for these two people to refer to ms mohammadi 's son , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast told a weekly news conference on tuesday .
doing journalistic research in iran on a tourist visa is very dangerous , says , zoerner . " iran is not a free country and has been trying for years to hinder journalists who are practicing their profession . if you 're caught doing research there as a tourist , you 're taking a huge risk , " zoerner said .

union members voted overwhelmingly on tuesday to extend their industrial action into wednesday and followed through with their threats to shut down some train services and stop fuel deliveries .
the sncf national rail company , which ran just one-in-three trains on tuesday , said service would likely be as badly disrupted on wednesday as the day before .
international train travel , however , was expected to return to normal with the eurostar service unaffected and many other trains running at almost normal levels to other destinations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers near marseille joined the protests pinch already being felt at the pump refinery workers , on the other hand , blocked fuel supplies at eight refineries , including all of oil major total 's six refineries in france , the cgt union said .
unions said some local fuel depots were also struck , raising the risk of shortages at fuel pumps , if the strike action continues .
an ongoing strike of oil terminals at the mediterranean port of marseille has left dozens of oil tankers and cargo ships waiting outside the harbor to be unloaded .
the stoppage has already led to diesel supplies running out on the island of corsica .
the french oil lobby ufip said on tuesday that gasoline stations on the mainland could start to see shortages in just over a week , if the strike continues .
tuesday 's nationwide protests were the biggest since the pension reform battle began earlier this year , despite widely varying estimates from police and trade unions of how many people took part . unions spoke of some 3.5 million demonstrators , while police said the figure was more like 1.2 million .
the pension reforms , which would raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 , are a cornerstone of president nicolas sarkozy 's domestic political agenda , who has vowed not to back down , despite the protests .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

union members voted overwhelmingly on tuesday to extend their industrial action into wednesday and followed through with their threats to shut down some train services and stop fuel deliveries .
the sncf national rail company , which ran just one-in-three trains on tuesday , said service would likely be as badly disrupted on wednesday as the day before .
international train travel , however , was expected to return to normal with the eurostar service unaffected and many other trains running at almost normal levels to other destinations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers near marseille joined the protests pinch already being felt at the pump refinery workers , on the other hand , blocked fuel supplies at eight refineries , including all of oil major total 's six refineries in france , the cgt union said .
unions said some local fuel depots were also struck , raising the risk of shortages at fuel pumps , if the strike action continues .
an ongoing strike of oil terminals at the mediterranean port of marseille has left dozens of oil tankers and cargo ships waiting outside the harbor to be unloaded .
the stoppage has already led to diesel supplies running out on the island of corsica .
the french oil lobby ufip said on tuesday that gasoline stations on the mainland could start to see shortages in just over a week , if the strike continues .
tuesday 's nationwide protests were the biggest since the pension reform battle began earlier this year , despite widely varying estimates from police and trade unions of how many people took part . unions spoke of some 3.5 million demonstrators , while police said the figure was more like 1.2 million .
the pension reforms , which would raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 , are a cornerstone of president nicolas sarkozy 's domestic political agenda , who has vowed not to back down , despite the protests .

union members voted overwhelmingly on tuesday to extend their industrial action into wednesday and followed through with their threats to shut down some train services and stop fuel deliveries .
the sncf national rail company , which ran just one-in-three trains on tuesday , said service would likely be as badly disrupted on wednesday as the day before .
international train travel , however , was expected to return to normal with the eurostar service unaffected and many other trains running at almost normal levels to other destinations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers near marseille joined the protests pinch already being felt at the pump refinery workers , on the other hand , blocked fuel supplies at eight refineries , including all of oil major total 's six refineries in france , the cgt union said .
unions said some local fuel depots were also struck , raising the risk of shortages at fuel pumps , if the strike action continues .
an ongoing strike of oil terminals at the mediterranean port of marseille has left dozens of oil tankers and cargo ships waiting outside the harbor to be unloaded .
the stoppage has already led to diesel supplies running out on the island of corsica .
the french oil lobby ufip said on tuesday that gasoline stations on the mainland could start to see shortages in just over a week , if the strike continues .
tuesday 's nationwide protests were the biggest since the pension reform battle began earlier this year , despite widely varying estimates from police and trade unions of how many people took part . unions spoke of some 3.5 million demonstrators , while police said the figure was more like 1.2 million .
the pension reforms , which would raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 , are a cornerstone of president nicolas sarkozy 's domestic political agenda , who has vowed not to back down , despite the protests .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many believe the hooligans to be part of an organized movement to ruin serbia 's reputation in europe . serbian officials expressed fear of a right-wing extremist plot against their country 's entry to the european union , after serbian soccer hooligans clashed with italian police tuesday evening at the two countries ' euro 2012 qualifying game .
" obviously somebody wants to demonstrate that serbia is neither ready , nor mature enough to go to europe , " justice ministry state secretary , slobodan homen , said wednesday in an interview with tv b92 .
at least sixteen people were hospitalized and 17 serb fans arrested in the northern italian city of genoa after violent riots caused a 40-minute delay to the match and then forced the game to be abandoned six minutes in .
part of a bigger plot the president of the serbian football organization fss , tomislav karadzic , said the riots were organized in belgrade , well ahead of the match .
" we have had hints that this would happen .
these kids are just the executors , those who ordered this are in belgrade , " he told serbian reporters after the game was abandoned , adding , " the state must react . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent right-extremist turned belgrade 's pride parade into a battleground the serb hooligans are believed by many to be part of an organized , ultra-nationalist movement to damage serbia 's chances at eu accession , according to german press agency dpa 's belgrade correspondent boris babic , who told deutsche welle that serbia fears further damage to its reputation .
babic said the soccer hooligans were part of the same movement that rioted in protest at belgrade 's pride parade , adding that there was a " group of maybe 500 individuals who are at the core of every violent event in the country since the 1990s . "
he believes the hooligans to be mafia pawns , rather than true sports fans .
" these criminal organizations have used football for drug smuggling , for an exercise of political influence and whatever can be drawn from their position of power .
they mostly get away without being sentenced to prison , " he said .
hooligans threw flares at the players two police officers and 14 fans were injured in clashes after the game .
police seized clubs and knives from serb hooligans , who also hurled flares onto the pitch .
italian authorities claim they were not warned by serbia as to the danger posed by the hooligans , who arrived with banners proclaiming " kosovo is ours . "
newspaper reports have disputed the authorities ' claim .
originally , the hooligans had refused to sit in their designated area and had to be herded in by police .
" in the process , they were pushed in without any of them being checked or frisked , " according to world soccer 's rome correspondent , paddy agnew .
bildunterschrift : the hooligans brought in objects ranging from garden shears to firecrackers " these guys got in with all kinds of petards , smoke bombs , metal objects , garden sheers , " he told deutsche welle , adding , " obviously the italian authorities will have to explain how that happened . "
also arrested was an italian fan who attacked serb supporters with a crowbar .

many believe the hooligans to be part of an organized movement to ruin serbia 's reputation in europe . serbian officials expressed fear of a right-wing extremist plot against their country 's entry to the european union , after serbian soccer hooligans clashed with italian police tuesday evening at the two countries ' euro 2012 qualifying game .
" obviously somebody wants to demonstrate that serbia is neither ready , nor mature enough to go to europe , " justice ministry state secretary , slobodan homen , said wednesday in an interview with tv b92 .
at least sixteen people were hospitalized and 17 serb fans arrested in the northern italian city of genoa after violent riots caused a 40-minute delay to the match and then forced the game to be abandoned six minutes in .
part of a bigger plot the president of the serbian football organization fss , tomislav karadzic , said the riots were organized in belgrade , well ahead of the match .
" we have had hints that this would happen .
these kids are just the executors , those who ordered this are in belgrade , " he told serbian reporters after the game was abandoned , adding , " the state must react . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent right-extremist turned belgrade 's pride parade into a battleground the serb hooligans are believed by many to be part of an organized , ultra-nationalist movement to damage serbia 's chances at eu accession , according to german press agency dpa 's belgrade correspondent boris babic , who told deutsche welle that serbia fears further damage to its reputation .
babic said the soccer hooligans were part of the same movement that rioted in protest at belgrade 's pride parade , adding that there was a " group of maybe 500 individuals who are at the core of every violent event in the country since the 1990s . "
he believes the hooligans to be mafia pawns , rather than true sports fans .
" these criminal organizations have used football for drug smuggling , for an exercise of political influence and whatever can be drawn from their position of power .
they mostly get away without being sentenced to prison , " he said .
hooligans threw flares at the players two police officers and 14 fans were injured in clashes after the game .
police seized clubs and knives from serb hooligans , who also hurled flares onto the pitch .
italian authorities claim they were not warned by serbia as to the danger posed by the hooligans , who arrived with banners proclaiming " kosovo is ours . "
newspaper reports have disputed the authorities ' claim .
originally , the hooligans had refused to sit in their designated area and had to be herded in by police .
" in the process , they were pushed in without any of them being checked or frisked , " according to world soccer 's rome correspondent , paddy agnew .
bildunterschrift : the hooligans brought in objects ranging from garden shears to firecrackers " these guys got in with all kinds of petards , smoke bombs , metal objects , garden sheers , " he told deutsche welle , adding , " obviously the italian authorities will have to explain how that happened . "
also arrested was an italian fan who attacked serb supporters with a crowbar .
the italian team were wearing black armbands to show solidarity with the families of four italian soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .
before the game , the serbs ’ first choice goalkeeper vladimir stojkovic was attacked by the fans , who threw a flare onto the team bus .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

the new rules are part of president nicolas sarkozy 's law and order crackdown .
the bill calls for any foreign-born citizens naturalized for less than 10 years to be stripped of their citizenship if convicted of violent crimes against police officers or other public officials .
this punishment currently applies only to terrorism charges .
the new measures would also allow the police to deport foreign nationals , including those from other eu countries , for repeated acts of theft , aggressive begging , or for illegally occupying land - a move that appears to target foreign-born roma gypsies living in france .
in addition , the new law will make it easier to expel any foreigner who is considered a burden on france 's social welfare system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson wants ' good french citizens ' sarkozy 's government drew condemnation from eu officials in recent months for rounding up hundreds of roma from illegal camps and deporting them to romania and bulgaria .
immigration minister eric besson , who proposed the new rules , said he wanted a “ mechanism for producing good french citizens . ”
he hailed the measures , which passed comfortably in the first reading , 294-239 , calling the vote “ a big first step in the building of a european immigration policy . ”
critics , however , claim that the plan will make second-class citizens of immigrants who obtain french nationality .
the draft legislation still has to be put before the senate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 13.10.2010 marches in favor of stuttgart 21 rail project gain support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public support has been drowned out by the opposition opposition to the stuttgart 21 rail project has overtaken german media .
but while the supporters of the project may be in the minority , they 've also been holding protests which are growing in numbers . in the public debate over the controversial stuttgart 21 rail station renovation , a growing number of people are gathering to counter the massive opposition and show their support for the project .
christian list , organizer of the weekly pro-stuttgart 21 marches , said he thought the opposition had gotten out of hand .
" my beginning as a political activist was when i saw the people yelling and crying " liars ! " to the politicians in stuttgart , " he told deutsche welle .
" it all went a little bit too far .
so that was the moment when i said now is the point when i have to do something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supporters march to city hall every thursday growing in numbers every thursday , list gets together with a number of people and marches along a four-kilometer route to the city hall , where the crowd hears speeches to rally support .
he said the first march brought about 100 people , but that they have grown every week since , and that the most recent march drew 4,000 people .
that is still just a small fraction of the 60,000 to 100,000 people who showed up for the most recent protest against the project last saturday .
but list said the reasons why so many people have mobilized in opposition are not all based on fact .
" the politicians made big mistakes in the communication of this project , " he said .
" my opinion is that the people have too much information and they are overwhelmed by it .
so they just do n't know what is right and what is wrong . "
list said he supports the project because while it may be expensive , the economic benefits of connecting stuttgart to a broader high-speed rail network will eventually bring in even more money .
and although about 280 trees in the palace gardens have to be cut down , the project moves the train station underground , freeing up 100 hectares of land for public space where even more trees will be planted .
arbitration meetings there is little doubt that stuttgart 21 opponents have the loudest voice in the media .
their main complaints are that the renovation cost of 7 billion euros is far too high , and that the construction will damage the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler , left , said he is optimistic the arbitration will continue and they earned some vindication in their first meetings with state-appointed arbitrator heiner geissler on tuesday night , when geissler appeared to chastise state authorities for not being sufficiently transparent .
" all facts , all numbers , and all assessments have to be laid out on the table , " he told reporters .
" that 's the only way the lost trust and credibility can be won back .
and that 's an extremely important goal that we 're working toward in these talks . "
geissler added that he was optimistic that the discussions could continue and eventually reach a solution .
accusations of conflicting interests list runs his own communications firm , and he said working professionally in that field helped him in getting his message out .
but it has also led some people to claim he is not just a regular citizen voicing his opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : list said he hopes for a quick solution to the controversy " there are accusations that i work for -lrb- state rail company -rrb- deutsche bahn , or that i work for the city , that i 'm paid for doing this , " he said .
" and that 's not true .
my agency is working for different customers , but we do n't have deutsche bahn as a customer . "
despite his views on the project , list says his greatest hope is that the arbitration with opponents of stuttgart 21 will quickly lead to a resolution of the controversy .
" this divides the city right now , " he said .
" i have the hope that one day , very soon , this all calms down . "

islam and muslims are met with particular reservations . the study released wednesday called " right-wing extremism in germany 2010 " argues that extreme views have penetrated to the heart of german society .
but , although between 10 and 20 percent of the population approve of traditional far-right positions such as the need for a dictator , or say that the nazis were n't so bad after all , policy makers will be more alarmed at the high levels of approval given to statements expressing disapproval of foreigners in germany .
for example , 32 percent approve of the statement that " when there 's a shortage of jobs , foreigners should be sent back home ; " 34 percent agree or strongly agree with the statement that " foreigners only come here to exploit germany 's social welfare system ; " and 35 percent think that " germany has a dangerous level of foreign influence as a result of the many foreigners in the country .

"
but extreme views turned into majority opinions when it came to islam , with 55 percent saying they could understand that people find arabs unpleasant , and 58 percent saying that the practice of the muslim religion should be " considerably restricted . "
indeed , an absolute majority of those who otherwise did not hold extremist views agreed with these two statements .
the survey was carried out in april , before the latest controversy over the role of islam in german society .
the researchers have carried out a similar survey every two years since 2002 , and , after the figures for 2008 -lrb- during an economic boom -rrb- turned out to be considerably lower than those of the years before , this year 's figures have returned roughly to the norm .
although the researchers argue that the survey proves that right-wing extremist views have reached the " middle " of society , their own figures show that such views are far more prevalent among the elderly , the poorly educated and the unemployed .

following a meeting with thaci in the capital city of pristina , clinton said the dialogue should begin as soon as possible . " ... even though there will be elections here and then in the following years elections in serbia , we believe that it is in kosovo 's interest for this dialogue to begin and to conclude in as expeditious a manner as possible , " clinton said .
clinton said the united states would take on a support role in the talks , which are to be brokered by the eu .

the two nations had agreed in september to move ahead with talks about shared practical concerns such as transport and telecommunications , as well as more sensitive issues like the return of refugees , the status of serbian orthodox monasteries and the majority serbs living in northern kosovo .
but just weeks after the agreement , the sudden resignation of president fatmir sejdiu ignited fears that the internal political crisis could stall the talks .
a step forward following his meeting with clinton , thaci said that pristina was ready to move past the rift with belgrade .
" time has come for finishing a century old conflict between kosovo and serbia .
kosovo is ready , " the prime minister said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 13.10.2010 hochtief prepares defense against spanish takeover bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction giant hochtief employs 55,000 people spain 's acs construction has grown rapidly in recent years , and is seeking to expand further by acquiring germany 's hochtief .
meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

if the trials are successful , the eurostar monoply on the route could become a thing of the past . a train belonging to german rail operator deutsche bahn entered the channel tunnel that connects england with mainland europe for the first time on wednesday .
the ice3 train , built by the german company siemens , threatens to rival the monopoly held by the french-built eurostar train . since the trains still lack approval for the route between france and britain , they were pulled by a locomotive .
on board were staff from deutsche bahn and tunnel operator eurotunnel plus a technical team , but no passengers .
end of an era ?
the ice train was the first passenger train not operated by eurostar to use the tunnel , after eu rules required the tunnel be opened to competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurostar trains have had a monopoly on the tunnel france , which owns 55 percent of the cross-channel eurostar service , has reacted angrily to the company decision last week to buy trains worth about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 836 million -rrb- from siemens , rather than the french company alstom .
testing continues the train went only part of the way through the tunnel before returning to france .
a full trip to london is scheduled for next week .
deutsche bahn plans to offer passengers a high-speed connection with ice trains through the tunnel under the english channel by the end of 2013 .
about nine million passengers travel each year on the eurotstar train routes that connect brussels , london and paris .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

first , he had his spectacles stolen at a launch party in london for his new novel " freedom . "
then it transpired that the wrong draft of the book had been published in britain and an entire print run of 80,000 copies had to be pulped . but the rapturous reception he was given at the frankfurt book fair last week no doubt provided some comfort .
" he was surrounded by an entourage of admirers wherever he went , " said german author and illustrator nadia budde , who was there to pick up a german youth literature award . the media circus has continued to dog him on his current reading tour .
the interest he 's generating is no surprise given how well " freedom , " which took him nine years to complete , is doing in germany .
when it was published in translation last month , it shot straight into the top five on the spiegel bestseller list and his readings this week are all sold out . dead or - very much - alive ? not least because franzen spent time in berlin as a fulbright scholar , germany has always had a very soft spot for him .
but not only him - a visit to any german bookstore provides ample evidence that readers in the land of " poets and thinkers " ca n't seem to get enough of american fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the novel dead ?
" people here take literature very seriously , " franzen told journalists in frankfurt over the weekend . but why specifically american literature , especially when many believe it 's seen better days ?
us critic lee siegel triggered a storm of controversy this summer when he pronounced the american novel dead in an article for the new york observer . " fiction has become culturally irrelevant , " he railed .
" for about a million reasons , fiction has now become a museum-piece genre , most of whose practitioners are more like cripplingly self-conscious curators or theoreticians than writers . " german readers beg to differ .
" contemporary us literature is just more diverse and original than its german equivalent , " observed heinz ickstadt from the john f. kennedy institute for north american studies in berlin . the rock-n-roll factor a big fan of american writers , nadia budde feels that they have a lightness of touch that their german counterparts lack - and that in comparison , german fiction is indeed a " museum-piece genre . " " you can always see how carefully -lsb- german -rsb- novels have been constructed , polished and controlled , " she said , pointing to writers such as daniel kehlmann , " whereas there 's something very rock and roll about novels by us writers like franzen , jeffrey eugenides , michael chabon and david foster wallace .
they have something unbridled about them , something very free and easy , effortless , cool and crazy - something that germans long to have but just do n't . " like many of his contemporaries , franzen certainly writes with a visceral edge .
" my idea of a novel is something that has an emotional impact , so what i do is to go to the places where we feel the strongest emotions , " said franzen .
" -lsb- as a writer -rsb- you try and get energy going in a book , and you reach for the content that has its own intrinsic energy .
what you want is to make the pages come alive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us authors are edgier than their german counterparts he and his peers can make german writing look very heavy-handed - especially when it 's aiming for humor .
" as close as it is to reality , us literature is not as naked and stark - reading contemporary german writing can sometimes feel like having things pointed out to you under a neon light , " said budde . love-hate relationship with the us what also makes germany such an enthusiastic market for us writers is the innate familiarity to germans of today 's america .
even though the trans-atlantic relationship suffered during the bush administration , to germany the us still represents the new world .
over the years , it 's lost none of its sheen . " despite all the criticism that exists against the us , it 's still the land of opportunity to us , " said budde , " not just in terms of money and success , but also as a country that 's home to an incredible mix of nationalities . "
historically , of course , it 's also a country where immigrants could reinvent themselves and shrug off their past . so while us writers like franzen and john irving are happy to wear influences such as stendhal , dickens and tolstoy on their sleeves , they also manage to create what franzen calls " enveloping narratives " that take on their own momentum . in contrast , " contemporary german writers just seem so very weighed down by european history and literary classics , " observed budde . but ultimately , the dominance of us fiction in the german book market could also have more prosaic reasons .
in literature as in cinema , it 's america that calls the shots in germany . " it has a lot to do with the structure of book markets , " said heinz ickstadt .
" big names inevitably work their magic , and the german book market does n't want to be seen to be limping behind when it comes to getting out the latest thomas pynchon or richard powers .
potential bestsellers are always going to be a temptation . " author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although stojkovic was not seriously injured , he refused to play out of fear , choosing to remain in the dressing room .
serb players may have encouraged hooligans incitement came from within the serb soccer team , according to agnew .
" the footballers made this three-finger signal which means ‘ greater serbia . '
they made that to their own fans , " he told deutsche welle .
italian coach cesare prandelli defended the serb players .
" we asked our opponents to go to their fans to try to calm them down … i do n't know what signs they made but they were clearly afraid , " the trainer said .
' 20 years of neglect ' meanwhile , former yugoslavia international player savo milosevic told belgrade 's b92 television that the violence in genoa was the result of 20 years of government neglect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prandelli defended the serb players , saying they were visibly afraid " the government has been completely disinterested in sport and its problems over the last 20 years , hence serbia is now paying a heavy price for the failure to tackle hooliganism swiftly and decisively , " he said .
tuesday 's rioting is certainly not the first incident of violence by serb hooligans .
in 2008 , after kosovo declared independence from serbia , a chanting crowd of young men left stadium stands to torch the us embassy in belgrade and ransack several others .

union members voted overwhelmingly on tuesday to extend their industrial action into wednesday and followed through with their threats to shut down some train services and stop fuel deliveries .
the sncf national rail company , which ran just one-in-three trains on tuesday , said service would likely be as badly disrupted on wednesday as the day before .
international train travel , however , was expected to return to normal with the eurostar service unaffected and many other trains running at almost normal levels to other destinations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers near marseille joined the protests pinch already being felt at the pump refinery workers , on the other hand , blocked fuel supplies at eight refineries , including all of oil major total 's six refineries in france , the cgt union said .
unions said some local fuel depots were also struck , raising the risk of shortages at fuel pumps , if the strike action continues .
an ongoing strike of oil terminals at the mediterranean port of marseille has left dozens of oil tankers and cargo ships waiting outside the harbor to be unloaded .
the stoppage has already led to diesel supplies running out on the island of corsica .
the french oil lobby ufip said on tuesday that gasoline stations on the mainland could start to see shortages in just over a week , if the strike continues .
tuesday 's nationwide protests were the biggest since the pension reform battle began earlier this year , despite widely varying estimates from police and trade unions of how many people took part . unions spoke of some 3.5 million demonstrators , while police said the figure was more like 1.2 million .
the pension reforms , which would raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 , are a cornerstone of president nicolas sarkozy 's domestic political agenda , who has vowed not to back down , despite the protests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 13.10.2010 syrian court strikes back in un hariri probe with own arrest warrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafiq hariri was killed by a car bomb attack in beirut in 2005 a syrian court allegedly issues arrest warrants against 33 officials , including former un investigator detlev mehlis , involved in the international probe into the assassination of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri . the potential for an escalation in tensions surrounding the un-backed investigation into the murder of rafiq hariri increased dramatically last week when a damascus court allegedly issued arrest warrants against individuals it claims misled the international tribunal .
it is claimed that the syrian court has ordered the arrest of 33 people including detlev mehlis , the german prosecutor who led the early stages of the un investigation , accusing a wide range of officials of giving false testimony to the un tribunal .
according to general jamil al-sayyed , the former head of lebanon 's security services who was imprisoned for over four years on suspicion of being involved in hariri 's killing , a senior judge in damascus has issued arrest warrants " against judges , security officers , politicians , journalists and other lebanese , arab and foreign officials and individuals " involved in the investigation into the 2005 assassination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayyed issued his complaint to the court in damascus along with mehlis , the officials targeted by the damascus court include ashraf rifi , lebanon 's chief of police , top prosecutor saeed mirza , former justice minister charles rizk and abdel halim khadda , syria 's exiled former vice president .
sayyed , who along with three other suspects in hariri 's murder was released last year due to lack of evidence , lodged a complaint with the damascus court claiming that the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- was based on fabricated testimony aimed at implicating syria and its supporters in lebanon .
sayyed claims that lebanese officials had refused to consider his complaint and that the un had also rejected his accusations , leading to him submitting his case to the court in damascus .
german prosecutor rejects claims the investigation led by mehlis , the commissioner of the un international independent investigation commission -lrb- uniiic -rrb- between 2005 and 2006 and author of two reports that implicated lebanese and syrian military intelligence in the assassination , has regularly been cited by syria and the shiite militant group hezbollah in their attempts to discredit the entire process .
the arrest warrant suggests that as tensions around the probe increase so will the campaign against mehlis and his work on the case .
mehlis rejected the claims that an arrest warrant had been issued against him and told deutsche welle that he was unaware of what basis any such warrant would have .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehlis and his investigation have been attacked by critics " i do not have the slightest idea what basis , if any , syria has for issuing an arrest warrant and i have not received any official notification from anyone , including the un and my own government on the actual existence of a syrian arrest warrant against me , " he said .
" if indeed an arrest warrant exists among others against the former lebanese justice minister , the chief of police the general prosecutor and above all witnesses in the assassination case , i would consider this as interference in the ongoing investigation . "
when asked if the arrest warrants added weight to the belief that damascus was somehow involved in hariri 's death and that syria was trying to further discredit the investigation , mehlis said : " you certainly have to wonder for what reason a country is so determined to get rid of an independent judicial process . "
heiko wimmen , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , questioned the legitimacy of the warrants and the sources behind the evidence supporting them . " it is next to impossible to judge whether or not there is reliable factual evidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" the fact is that , during the early phase , the statements of witnesses with doubtful credentials were given more credit than they seemed to deserve .
with hindsight , it appears difficult to avoid the conclusion that during that phase , the investigation was determined to indict the syrian regime or a certain faction within it , and was therefore ready to accept evidence at face value that should have been probed more thoroughly . " " the syrians and their lebanese allies claim that this was not merely a result of negligence or bias on the side of the tribunal , but that these ' false witnesses ' were in fact ' fabricated ' by people close to hariri - the group against which the syrians now issued the warrants .
at least one of the ' false witnesses ' defected to syria in late 2005 , retracted his statements , and claimed that he was threatened and bribed into making them , so it is possible that the syrian warrants are based on these statements . "
arrest warrants part of a wider plan of disruption " the arrest warrants are part of a concerted effort to undermine confidence and faith in the stl , " nadim shehadi , a middle east expert at the royal institute of international affairs , chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" it is succeeding to a certain extent because it is diverting attention to side issues . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut was paralyzed by strikes , riots and bombings in 2007 " the question is not really about the warrants but about the stl which is an instrument of international protection over lebanon .
when it was set up , the country was under siege with parliament paralysed , the town center was occupied by the opposition , assassinations were regularly occurring , terror attacks and threats were ongoing .
the failure of the stl would be the failure of this protection . it is the un that is on trial as much as the perpetrators of the crimes in lebanon - it is a test of whether international legality exists and can provide such protection . " " making this move now is obviously part of a larger campaign , waged by hezbollah and syria , to discredit the tribunal and ultimately , to scrap it altogether , ahead of the expected indictments , which according to unofficial information will implicate members of hezbollah , " said heiko wimmen .
" it is a message to hariri that all his attempts to reconcile with damascus will not do as long as he refuses to disown the tribunal . " the stl has been investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result . syria-lebanon relations likely to suffer further relations between lebanon and syria had been slowly normalizing since rafiq hariri 's death , as indicated by syrian president basher al-assad 's visit to lebanon in august and lebanese prime minister saad hariri 's efforts to improve the relationship between the two countries over the past year , even going as far as saying that he had been wrong to implicate syria in the death of his father .
however further tensions seem likely as a result of this week 's visit to beirut by iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad who is seen as a staunch supporter of hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between saad hariri and assad 's syria may unravel the visit and news of the arrest warrants are likely to strike a new blow to relations between damascus and beirut which are once again becoming strained over reports that the stl is ready to indict members of hezbollah in connection with hariri 's murder . just as significantly , it could also alter the course of the stl 's investigation and any subsequent prosecutions . " syria did not issue these arrest warrants , " said nadim shehadi .
" the announcement was made by the press office of general jamil sayyid .
an official syrian statement dismissing the importance of the warrants came a couple of days later . " " however , what is relevant in this affair is that it is an emphatic ' no ' from damascus to saad hariri 's offer of a compromise with both hezbollah and syria .
the compromise involves putting everything related to the assassinations in a box called ' the tribunal ' and carrying on with normal relations . " " also if there is any indictment of hezbollah members or syrians , hariri explicitly said that they would then be considered as rogue elements and not taken to implicate any others . the offer thus uses the stl as an instrument of stability rather than that of instability . the fact that the arrest warrants include most of saad hariri 's entourage and advisors means that the syrians will accept nothing less than abolition of the stl .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 13.10.2010 eu hopes to charge trucks for air and noise pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no shortage of trucks on its highways a long-disputed proposal for taxing road haulage companies for air and noise pollution could gain momentum this week when eu transportation ministers meet to try and end a two-year deadlock . european union transportation ministers meeting in brussels to amend the " eurovignette " directive could strike a deal on friday to make truck operators pay a pollution fee .
but they are n't expected to approve a more controversial proposal on a congestion charge .
the ministers have been discussing changes to the directive for more than two years .
among the contentious issues : charging truckers for environmental damage , which is n't mandatory under the current legislation .
air and noise pollution the new rules would require truck operators to pay for the air and noise pollution caused by their vehicles , in addition to the tolls they 're already paying for road building and repair .
the additional costs could be as high as 0.5 euro cents per kilometer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truckers already pay a toll to use german autobahns germany already has a toll system for heavy goods vehicles and currently charges between 17 and 18 cents per kilometer , according to adolf zobel , managing director of the german freight and waste trucking association -lrb- bgl -rrb- .
a part of the fee goes to air and noise pollution infrastructure measures such as noise-reducing asphalt and noise retention walls , he told deutsche welle .
while zobel acknowledges the reasons for charging a pollution fee , he objects to the current proposal that would allow eu member states to decide how the revenue should be spent .
" we say it must go entirely to infrastructure , including air and noise pollution measures ; roads need to have their own financing system , " he said .
" but brussels is considering allowing member states to use the money as they please . "
bgl and nearly all other european trucking associations object to the proposed road congestion charge .
and they 're not alone .
numerous national governments , worried about compounding truckers ' expenses , oppose the plan as well to win them over , the eu has weakened the proposal .
under a compromise now on the table , any congestion fee would have to be " revenue neutral " .
that means if national authorities , for instance , charge truckers higher tolls to use roads in peak hours , then they would have to reduce off-peak tolls by the same amount .
all watered down " a big problem with the revenue-neutral idea is that a lot of truckers really ca n't decide at what time of the day they can drive , " zobel said .
" that decision is often made by their customers . "
nor are environmental groups excited about the current proposal – but for a completely different reason .
" everything has been watered down , " said nina renshaw , deputy director of transport and environment , an organization that promotes the " polluter-pays " principle .
" it 's really important that congestion be part of the new directive . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congestion is a popular word in germany around vacation time congestion , she told deutsche welle , is a significant contributor to both air and noise pollution , so a mandatory fee aimed at reducing it only makes sense .
the eurovignette directive was first adopted in 1993 .
it was revised in 2006 before member states ’ squabbling over further changes brought talks to a standstill in 2008 .
the directive was put back on the european policy agenda by belgium , which has taken over the six-month rotating presidency of the council of the eu .
if the transportation ministers reach an agreement on amending the directive , then the proposed legislation must go to the european parliament for final approval .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 13.10.2010 open letter to chinese leaders from former officials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a picture of premier wen jiabao on the title page of a chinese newspaper a group of former communist party officials , academics and state media editors , most of them now in retirement , have come out with a strong plea for full freedom of speech in china . a group of former communist party officials , academics and state media editors , most of them now in retirement , have come out with a strong plea for full freedom of speech in china .
the letter was posted on several chinese and english websites on wednesday .
it was later deleted from chatrooms on major portals , possibly by government censors , though it continued to crop up in more obscure chat rooms .
mao 's former secretary among the signatories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's former secretary li rui is among the signatories the letter lists the names of 23 signatories , among them li rui , a former secretary to mao zedong , hu jiwei , the retired editor-in-chief of the communist party newspaper people 's daily , and jiang ping , the retired head of the china university of political science and law .
several other signatories are known for their reformist sympathies .
the main thrust of the bluntly worded letter is that the government should implement article 35 of the chinese constitution approved in 1982 , which allows chinese citizens " freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession and of demonstration " .
the " former avowal and concrete denial " of this right is described as " false democracy " in the letter .
the signatories call upon the government to give editors and journalists the freedom to report without restrictions and to end the system of censors previewing media and book content .
worried about the premier 's rights the letter cites recent examples of censorship , going so far as to state : " even the premier of our country does not have the freedom of speech or of press " .
apparently , the official xinhua news agency did not report comments by premier wen jiabao on political reform made in an important speech last august in the southern city of shenzhen .
as regards the communist party , the letter says that if the party does not reform itself , it will lose its vitality and die a natural death .
chinese citizens have the right to know the errors of the ruling party , the letter says .
leading chinese dissident liu xiaobo was awarded this year 's nobel peace prize last friday , though that event apparently has no direct connection with the group 's letter. ac / dpa / afp editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the decision breaks with tradition and stunned the author himself . howard jacobson was " truly flabbergasted " to win this year 's man booker prize , the author told reporters after the presentation of the award tuesday evening in london 's guildhall . jacobson 's " the finkler question " is the first humorous novel to win the most esteemed literary award in the english-speaking world . previously longlisted twice for the prize , jacobson had grown accustomed to going away empty handed and was not considered a favorite for this year 's award .
nevertheless , he convinced three of the five judges , beating out favorite tom mccarthy and two-time winner peter carey . " they -lsb- the man booker judges -rsb- took me in their arms a little bit in the longlist - the shortlist felt like an embrace , " said jacobson , 68 .
" i never thought the affair was going to be consummated . " boosting readership british newspaper the guardian called this year 's choice " a victory for that most overlooked genre on literary prize lists , the comic novel , " while the independent said the jury 's decision " broke the mould . " " the finkler question , " as jacobson says , explores the jewish experience in britain .
the main character , a bbc radio producer , is not jewish himself , but becomes fascinated with jewishness through two close friends . the man booker prize is endowed with 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 80,000 -rrb- , but jacobson said he 's more interested in winning readers than making money . " at my age it 's less about how much comes into your bank account as wanting readers , " said the author , who published his first novel 27 years ago .
" it 's very , very hard to get readers . " the long-awaited prize will no doubt help . author : kate bowen -lrb- reuters , afp , dpa -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new rules are part of president nicolas sarkozy 's law and order crackdown .
the bill calls for any foreign-born citizens naturalized for less than 10 years to be stripped of their citizenship if convicted of violent crimes against police officers or other public officials .
this punishment currently applies only to terrorism charges .
the new measures would also allow the police to deport foreign nationals , including those from other eu countries , for repeated acts of theft , aggressive begging , or for illegally occupying land - a move that appears to target foreign-born roma gypsies living in france .
in addition , the new law will make it easier to expel any foreigner who is considered a burden on france 's social welfare system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson wants ' good french citizens ' sarkozy 's government drew condemnation from eu officials in recent months for rounding up hundreds of roma from illegal camps and deporting them to romania and bulgaria .
immigration minister eric besson , who proposed the new rules , said he wanted a “ mechanism for producing good french citizens . ”
he hailed the measures , which passed comfortably in the first reading , 294-239 , calling the vote “ a big first step in the building of a european immigration policy . ”
critics , however , claim that the plan will make second-class citizens of immigrants who obtain french nationality .
the draft legislation still has to be put before the senate .

the new measures would also allow the police to deport foreign nationals , including those from other eu countries , for repeated acts of theft , aggressive begging , or for illegally occupying land - a move that appears to target foreign-born roma gypsies living in france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 13.10.2010 social services still struggling to break through to uk muslim youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups aim to help muslim boys and girls young british muslims are still reluctant to get the help they need from mainstream counseling services for fear of being misunderstood , says the muslim youth helpline , which helps young muslims cope with their issues . an organization in britain has set out to offer a support service to young muslims who are without a shoulder to lean on .
but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

he is well known for his frank criticism of the chinese regime .
after being prevented several times from leaving china , he has finally come to germany . liao yiwu was detained many times for his writings and has been under constant surveillance in china .
for many years , he was denied travel documents .
only during the chaos of the sichuan earthquake in 2008 , his application for a passport was granted by the authorities in his home city , chengdu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liao yiwu 's books are available only on the black market " now , for the first time i ’ m somewhere where freedom exists .
it is like a mouse jumping out of its hole .
in the past i could only perform underground .
now , i can perform in public .
i ’ ve never had such a great feeling before , " says liao yiwu . stories about china ’ s poorest liao attended this year ’ s frankfurt book fair after being prevented from coming here last year when china was the guest of honor . in china , his books are banned because liao yiwu tells stories about the lowest stratum of china ’ s society .
his books are only available on the black market .
but here in germany , liao yiwu is quite well-known . liao yiwu says that there are many chinese writers who are even more talented than himself .
they also try to get " out of their mouse holes " , he adds .
" through me many other chinese underground writers will get a chance to have their works translated and published in western languages , " he hopes . nobel boost for china ’ s intellectuals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nobel peace prize for liu xiaobo could give chinese intellectuals a new boost although the interest in chinese literature ebbed in germany after last year ’ s frankfurt book fair , the nobel prize for detained dissident liu xiaobo might change things again .
liao yiwu is a close friend of liu xiaobo 's .
his reaction to the nobel peace prize announcement : " this shows that a persistent , stubborn - and some might even say - silly individual can experience a happy ending . " the nobel prize is an important encouragement for liao yiwu and other intellectuals who are as stubborn in defying china ’ s regime . liao yiwu has known liu xiaobo for more than 20 years .
he is confident .
" the peace prize will give us intellectuals a boost .
there are people who are saying that the nobel peace prize shouldn ’ t go to someone who is in prison .
but this is only envy and it is their problem ! " more stories to tell liao yiwu will return to sichuan at the end of the month .
there he will continue to do what he can do best - writing .
even if a political system changes , a writer will keep writing , he explains . " there are so many untold stories from the very bottom of chinese society that i still have to write .
there are new stories wherever you look - especially in sichuan . " liao yiwu knows that back in china he won ’ t enjoy much freedom .
but he has never thought about staying on in germany or europe .
he believes that a writer who leaves the place where his mother tongue is spoken will not be able to continue writing . author : chi viet giang editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .

but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 13.10.2010 nato includes threat of cyber attack in new strategic concept document großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyber attacks on defense systems are a concern for nato nato plans to reform its mutual protection policy to include the increasing threat of cyber attack .
but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers will convene for a series of informal meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack . " " in the cyber world , individual hackers tend to pose the greatest danger to cyber security , but governments now include cyber war in their planning and operations .
but unlike a conventional attack , there are no national markings on a computer worm , " derek reveron said " many countries , including israel , russia , china , and the united states , have dedicated cyber programs within their defense establishments .
largely focused on defending their own networks , these organizations are developing offensive capabilities .
the greatest cyber capabilities lie in non-state actors and corporations though . " cyber attacks to be the opening salvos of future conflicts ? s ecurity experts are predicting that while cyber attacks alone could cause systems to be severely compromised and disabled , the development of cyber warfare could lead to stuxnet-type worms being released as the opening salvo in a conventional attack ahead of a traditional bombing campaign or land invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian computer viruses led the way before tanks in georgia " the most recent example of this was the cyber attack that accompanied russia 's invasion of georgia in 2008 , " reveron said .
" as russian tanks and aircraft were entering georgian territory , cyber warriors attacked the georgian ministry of defense .
though it had a minimal effect , the attack was a harbinger ; future conflicts will have both a physical dimension and a virtual dimension . " " in the worst scenario , a cyber attack would target industrial systems and attempt to control or destroy physical infrastructure .
in the most likely scenario , cyber capabilities would be used to disrupt command and control of military forces and discredit governments through media manipulation . " however , alex neil does not believe that all-out cyber war is imminent . " the threat is a salient one but cyber warfare is not currently at the forefront of active operations , " neil said .
" what we ’ re dealing with at the moment is cyber espionage and sabotage rather than warfare , which suggests all-out conflict . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while the supporters of the project may be in the minority , they 've also been holding protests which are growing in numbers . in the public debate over the controversial stuttgart 21 rail station renovation , a growing number of people are gathering to counter the massive opposition and show their support for the project .
christian list , organizer of the weekly pro-stuttgart 21 marches , said he thought the opposition had gotten out of hand .
" my beginning as a political activist was when i saw the people yelling and crying " liars ! " to the politicians in stuttgart , " he told deutsche welle .
" it all went a little bit too far .
so that was the moment when i said now is the point when i have to do something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supporters march to city hall every thursday growing in numbers every thursday , list gets together with a number of people and marches along a four-kilometer route to the city hall , where the crowd hears speeches to rally support .
he said the first march brought about 100 people , but that they have grown every week since , and that the most recent march drew 4,000 people .
that is still just a small fraction of the 60,000 to 100,000 people who showed up for the most recent protest against the project last saturday .
but list said the reasons why so many people have mobilized in opposition are not all based on fact .
" the politicians made big mistakes in the communication of this project , " he said .
" my opinion is that the people have too much information and they are overwhelmed by it .
so they just do n't know what is right and what is wrong . "
list said he supports the project because while it may be expensive , the economic benefits of connecting stuttgart to a broader high-speed rail network will eventually bring in even more money .
and although about 280 trees in the palace gardens have to be cut down , the project moves the train station underground , freeing up 100 hectares of land for public space where even more trees will be planted .
arbitration meetings there is little doubt that stuttgart 21 opponents have the loudest voice in the media .
their main complaints are that the renovation cost of 7 billion euros is far too high , and that the construction will damage the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler , left , said he is optimistic the arbitration will continue and they earned some vindication in their first meetings with state-appointed arbitrator heiner geissler on tuesday night , when geissler appeared to chastise state authorities for not being sufficiently transparent .
" all facts , all numbers , and all assessments have to be laid out on the table , " he told reporters .
" that 's the only way the lost trust and credibility can be won back .
and that 's an extremely important goal that we 're working toward in these talks . "
geissler added that he was optimistic that the discussions could continue and eventually reach a solution .
accusations of conflicting interests list runs his own communications firm , and he said working professionally in that field helped him in getting his message out .
but it has also led some people to claim he is not just a regular citizen voicing his opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : list said he hopes for a quick solution to the controversy " there are accusations that i work for -lrb- state rail company -rrb- deutsche bahn , or that i work for the city , that i 'm paid for doing this , " he said .
" and that 's not true .
my agency is working for different customers , but we do n't have deutsche bahn as a customer . "
despite his views on the project , list says his greatest hope is that the arbitration with opponents of stuttgart 21 will quickly lead to a resolution of the controversy .
" this divides the city right now , " he said .
" i have the hope that one day , very soon , this all calms down . "

following a meeting with thaci in the capital city of pristina , clinton said the dialogue should begin as soon as possible . " ... even though there will be elections here and then in the following years elections in serbia , we believe that it is in kosovo 's interest for this dialogue to begin and to conclude in as expeditious a manner as possible , " clinton said .
clinton said the united states would take on a support role in the talks , which are to be brokered by the eu .
washington has been a strong supporter of kosovo , one of about 70 nations that recognizes kosovo as independent . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia vows it will never recognise the independence of kosovo the us secretary of state emphasized that the talks must not be allowed to drag on .

the two nations had agreed in september to move ahead with talks about shared practical concerns such as transport and telecommunications , as well as more sensitive issues like the return of refugees , the status of serbian orthodox monasteries and the majority serbs living in northern kosovo .
but just weeks after the agreement , the sudden resignation of president fatmir sejdiu ignited fears that the internal political crisis could stall the talks .
a step forward following his meeting with clinton , thaci said that pristina was ready to move past the rift with belgrade .
" time has come for finishing a century old conflict between kosovo and serbia .
kosovo is ready , " the prime minister said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 13.10.2010 american fiction is germany 's preferred bedtime reading großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jonathan franzen is promoting his new book " freedom " in germany us writer jonathan franzen is currently promoting his latest bestselling novel in germany , where - for a variety of reasons - american writers tend to outsell home-grown talent . jonathan franzen has been having a hard time of it recently .
first , he had his spectacles stolen at a launch party in london for his new novel " freedom . "
then it transpired that the wrong draft of the book had been published in britain and an entire print run of 80,000 copies had to be pulped . but the rapturous reception he was given at the frankfurt book fair last week no doubt provided some comfort .
" he was surrounded by an entourage of admirers wherever he went , " said german author and illustrator nadia budde , who was there to pick up a german youth literature award . the media circus has continued to dog him on his current reading tour .
the interest he 's generating is no surprise given how well " freedom , " which took him nine years to complete , is doing in germany .
when it was published in translation last month , it shot straight into the top five on the spiegel bestseller list and his readings this week are all sold out . dead or - very much - alive ? not least because franzen spent time in berlin as a fulbright scholar , germany has always had a very soft spot for him .
but not only him - a visit to any german bookstore provides ample evidence that readers in the land of " poets and thinkers " ca n't seem to get enough of american fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the novel dead ?
" people here take literature very seriously , " franzen told journalists in frankfurt over the weekend . but why specifically american literature , especially when many believe it 's seen better days ?
us critic lee siegel triggered a storm of controversy this summer when he pronounced the american novel dead in an article for the new york observer . " fiction has become culturally irrelevant , " he railed .
" for about a million reasons , fiction has now become a museum-piece genre , most of whose practitioners are more like cripplingly self-conscious curators or theoreticians than writers . " german readers beg to differ .
" contemporary us literature is just more diverse and original than its german equivalent , " observed heinz ickstadt from the john f. kennedy institute for north american studies in berlin . the rock-n-roll factor a big fan of american writers , nadia budde feels that they have a lightness of touch that their german counterparts lack - and that in comparison , german fiction is indeed a " museum-piece genre . " " you can always see how carefully -lsb- german -rsb- novels have been constructed , polished and controlled , " she said , pointing to writers such as daniel kehlmann , " whereas there 's something very rock and roll about novels by us writers like franzen , jeffrey eugenides , michael chabon and david foster wallace .
they have something unbridled about them , something very free and easy , effortless , cool and crazy - something that germans long to have but just do n't . " like many of his contemporaries , franzen certainly writes with a visceral edge .
" my idea of a novel is something that has an emotional impact , so what i do is to go to the places where we feel the strongest emotions , " said franzen .
" -lsb- as a writer -rsb- you try and get energy going in a book , and you reach for the content that has its own intrinsic energy .
what you want is to make the pages come alive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us authors are edgier than their german counterparts he and his peers can make german writing look very heavy-handed - especially when it 's aiming for humor .
" as close as it is to reality , us literature is not as naked and stark - reading contemporary german writing can sometimes feel like having things pointed out to you under a neon light , " said budde . love-hate relationship with the us what also makes germany such an enthusiastic market for us writers is the innate familiarity to germans of today 's america .
even though the trans-atlantic relationship suffered during the bush administration , to germany the us still represents the new world .
over the years , it 's lost none of its sheen . " despite all the criticism that exists against the us , it 's still the land of opportunity to us , " said budde , " not just in terms of money and success , but also as a country that 's home to an incredible mix of nationalities . "
historically , of course , it 's also a country where immigrants could reinvent themselves and shrug off their past . so while us writers like franzen and john irving are happy to wear influences such as stendhal , dickens and tolstoy on their sleeves , they also manage to create what franzen calls " enveloping narratives " that take on their own momentum . in contrast , " contemporary german writers just seem so very weighed down by european history and literary classics , " observed budde . but ultimately , the dominance of us fiction in the german book market could also have more prosaic reasons .
in literature as in cinema , it 's america that calls the shots in germany . " it has a lot to do with the structure of book markets , " said heinz ickstadt .
" big names inevitably work their magic , and the german book market does n't want to be seen to be limping behind when it comes to getting out the latest thomas pynchon or richard powers .
potential bestsellers are always going to be a temptation . " author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

first , he had his spectacles stolen at a launch party in london for his new novel " freedom . "
then it transpired that the wrong draft of the book had been published in britain and an entire print run of 80,000 copies had to be pulped . but the rapturous reception he was given at the frankfurt book fair last week no doubt provided some comfort .
" he was surrounded by an entourage of admirers wherever he went , " said german author and illustrator nadia budde , who was there to pick up a german youth literature award . the media circus has continued to dog him on his current reading tour .
the interest he 's generating is no surprise given how well " freedom , " which took him nine years to complete , is doing in germany .
when it was published in translation last month , it shot straight into the top five on the spiegel bestseller list and his readings this week are all sold out . dead or - very much - alive ? not least because franzen spent time in berlin as a fulbright scholar , germany has always had a very soft spot for him .
but not only him - a visit to any german bookstore provides ample evidence that readers in the land of " poets and thinkers " ca n't seem to get enough of american fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the novel dead ?
" people here take literature very seriously , " franzen told journalists in frankfurt over the weekend . but why specifically american literature , especially when many believe it 's seen better days ?
us critic lee siegel triggered a storm of controversy this summer when he pronounced the american novel dead in an article for the new york observer . " fiction has become culturally irrelevant , " he railed .
" for about a million reasons , fiction has now become a museum-piece genre , most of whose practitioners are more like cripplingly self-conscious curators or theoreticians than writers . " german readers beg to differ .
" contemporary us literature is just more diverse and original than its german equivalent , " observed heinz ickstadt from the john f. kennedy institute for north american studies in berlin . the rock-n-roll factor a big fan of american writers , nadia budde feels that they have a lightness of touch that their german counterparts lack - and that in comparison , german fiction is indeed a " museum-piece genre . " " you can always see how carefully -lsb- german -rsb- novels have been constructed , polished and controlled , " she said , pointing to writers such as daniel kehlmann , " whereas there 's something very rock and roll about novels by us writers like franzen , jeffrey eugenides , michael chabon and david foster wallace .
they have something unbridled about them , something very free and easy , effortless , cool and crazy - something that germans long to have but just do n't . " like many of his contemporaries , franzen certainly writes with a visceral edge .
" my idea of a novel is something that has an emotional impact , so what i do is to go to the places where we feel the strongest emotions , " said franzen .
" -lsb- as a writer -rsb- you try and get energy going in a book , and you reach for the content that has its own intrinsic energy .
what you want is to make the pages come alive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us authors are edgier than their german counterparts he and his peers can make german writing look very heavy-handed - especially when it 's aiming for humor .
" as close as it is to reality , us literature is not as naked and stark - reading contemporary german writing can sometimes feel like having things pointed out to you under a neon light , " said budde . love-hate relationship with the us what also makes germany such an enthusiastic market for us writers is the innate familiarity to germans of today 's america .
even though the trans-atlantic relationship suffered during the bush administration , to germany the us still represents the new world .
over the years , it 's lost none of its sheen . " despite all the criticism that exists against the us , it 's still the land of opportunity to us , " said budde , " not just in terms of money and success , but also as a country that 's home to an incredible mix of nationalities . "
historically , of course , it 's also a country where immigrants could reinvent themselves and shrug off their past . so while us writers like franzen and john irving are happy to wear influences such as stendhal , dickens and tolstoy on their sleeves , they also manage to create what franzen calls " enveloping narratives " that take on their own momentum . in contrast , " contemporary german writers just seem so very weighed down by european history and literary classics , " observed budde . but ultimately , the dominance of us fiction in the german book market could also have more prosaic reasons .
in literature as in cinema , it 's america that calls the shots in germany . " it has a lot to do with the structure of book markets , " said heinz ickstadt .
" big names inevitably work their magic , and the german book market does n't want to be seen to be limping behind when it comes to getting out the latest thomas pynchon or richard powers .
potential bestsellers are always going to be a temptation . " author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

speaking on germany 's ard public television network , westerwelle reiterated earlier comments calling for major changes to the council .
the foreign minister criticized what he said was the lack of representation for certain regions of the world .
" it is not appropriate that two continents , like africa and latin america , do not have permanent seats on the un security council .
asia , too , rightfully views itself as underrepresented , " the german foreign minister said .
" that is why any reform of the united nations is not first and foremost about a permanent seat on the security council for us , but rather about a better reflection of global distribution of power , " westerwelle emphasized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will ' justify ' the un 's ' vote of confidence ' germany , on tuesday , won election to one of two non-permanent seats on the un security council assigned to western nations .
portugal was awarded the other seat , after canada withdrew its bid following two inconclusive rounds of voting .
all three nations had campaigned to represent the regional area called western europe and other groups -lrb- weog -rrb- . foreign minister westerwelle called the un 's selection a " significant vote of confidence " and pledged to " do everything possible to justify the confidence shown in us by the united nations . "
westerwelle , who was in new york to support germany 's bid , told reporters : " the world knows that it can count on germany .
we are now faced with the responsibility to establish peace , security and development around the globe . " the german victory is expected to boost the country 's new campaign to become a permanent member on the council .
chancellor angela merkel said in berlin that the government was delighted with the results . " germany will work hard during its term to push ahead on reforms of the un security council , " she said .
" that is the expectation that a lot of people in the world have . " more permanent members but reform of the united nations is a major issue on germany 's agenda .
westerwelle recently met counterparts from japan , india and brazil to discuss launching a reform campaign .
the so-called g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats . " today 's security council reflects the world 's power architecture after world war ii .
it should reflect the power structure of today 's world , " westerwelle said . the security council is the main global body charged with keeping international peace .
it has 15 members : the five permanent members russia , china , the us , britain and france , who have the right to veto any council resolution , and 10 non-permanent members .
each of these rotating countries stays on the council for two years . bildunterschrift : the other three non-permanent seats at stake this year had already been decided by virtue of being uncontested : india will take over from japan for the asian region , colombia takes mexico 's seat for latin america and south africa takes the place of uganda for africa .
each of the five new non-permanent members is to take up its seat on the security council on jan .
1 , 2011 . juergen chrobog , a former senior official in the foreign ministry and german ambassador to the us , told german radio ahead of the vote that germany wanted more participation in decisions . " we take on a lot of responsibility as important partners in un peace missions , " chrobog said . " more than 6,300 german troops are stationed in areas of conflict all over the world , particularly in afghanistan and the balkans , as well as hundreds of police officers .
if a country sends its citizens to these regions , it wants to have a say in decisions that lead to a deployment .

the letter was posted on several chinese and english websites on wednesday .
it was later deleted from chatrooms on major portals , possibly by government censors , though it continued to crop up in more obscure chat rooms .
mao 's former secretary among the signatories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's former secretary li rui is among the signatories the letter lists the names of 23 signatories , among them li rui , a former secretary to mao zedong , hu jiwei , the retired editor-in-chief of the communist party newspaper people 's daily , and jiang ping , the retired head of the china university of political science and law .
several other signatories are known for their reformist sympathies .
the main thrust of the bluntly worded letter is that the government should implement article 35 of the chinese constitution approved in 1982 , which allows chinese citizens " freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession and of demonstration " .
the " former avowal and concrete denial " of this right is described as " false democracy " in the letter .
the signatories call upon the government to give editors and journalists the freedom to report without restrictions and to end the system of censors previewing media and book content .
worried about the premier 's rights the letter cites recent examples of censorship , going so far as to state : " even the premier of our country does not have the freedom of speech or of press " .
apparently , the official xinhua news agency did not report comments by premier wen jiabao on political reform made in an important speech last august in the southern city of shenzhen .
as regards the communist party , the letter says that if the party does not reform itself , it will lose its vitality and die a natural death .
chinese citizens have the right to know the errors of the ruling party , the letter says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : debate surrounds google 's plans for street view in germany deadline looms for germans to blur homes from google street view why oberstaufen , a southern german town , supports google street view google responds to street view criticism in germany google seeks to ease german opposition to street view privacy -pipe- 13.10.2010 street view brings privacy debate to german mainstream , blogger says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view made privacy a concern of millions of germans street view represents germany 's first real discussion about online privacy , said markus beckedahl , editor of the influential blog netzpolitik .
but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 13.10.2010 marches in favor of stuttgart 21 rail project gain support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public support has been drowned out by the opposition opposition to the stuttgart 21 rail project has overtaken german media .
but while the supporters of the project may be in the minority , they 've also been holding protests which are growing in numbers . in the public debate over the controversial stuttgart 21 rail station renovation , a growing number of people are gathering to counter the massive opposition and show their support for the project .
christian list , organizer of the weekly pro-stuttgart 21 marches , said he thought the opposition had gotten out of hand .
" my beginning as a political activist was when i saw the people yelling and crying " liars ! " to the politicians in stuttgart , " he told deutsche welle .
" it all went a little bit too far .
so that was the moment when i said now is the point when i have to do something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supporters march to city hall every thursday growing in numbers every thursday , list gets together with a number of people and marches along a four-kilometer route to the city hall , where the crowd hears speeches to rally support .
he said the first march brought about 100 people , but that they have grown every week since , and that the most recent march drew 4,000 people .
that is still just a small fraction of the 60,000 to 100,000 people who showed up for the most recent protest against the project last saturday .
but list said the reasons why so many people have mobilized in opposition are not all based on fact .
" the politicians made big mistakes in the communication of this project , " he said .
" my opinion is that the people have too much information and they are overwhelmed by it .
so they just do n't know what is right and what is wrong . "
list said he supports the project because while it may be expensive , the economic benefits of connecting stuttgart to a broader high-speed rail network will eventually bring in even more money .
and although about 280 trees in the palace gardens have to be cut down , the project moves the train station underground , freeing up 100 hectares of land for public space where even more trees will be planted .
arbitration meetings there is little doubt that stuttgart 21 opponents have the loudest voice in the media .
their main complaints are that the renovation cost of 7 billion euros is far too high , and that the construction will damage the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler , left , said he is optimistic the arbitration will continue and they earned some vindication in their first meetings with state-appointed arbitrator heiner geissler on tuesday night , when geissler appeared to chastise state authorities for not being sufficiently transparent .
" all facts , all numbers , and all assessments have to be laid out on the table , " he told reporters .
" that 's the only way the lost trust and credibility can be won back .
and that 's an extremely important goal that we 're working toward in these talks . "
geissler added that he was optimistic that the discussions could continue and eventually reach a solution .
accusations of conflicting interests list runs his own communications firm , and he said working professionally in that field helped him in getting his message out .
but it has also led some people to claim he is not just a regular citizen voicing his opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : list said he hopes for a quick solution to the controversy " there are accusations that i work for -lrb- state rail company -rrb- deutsche bahn , or that i work for the city , that i 'm paid for doing this , " he said .
" and that 's not true .
my agency is working for different customers , but we do n't have deutsche bahn as a customer . "
despite his views on the project , list says his greatest hope is that the arbitration with opponents of stuttgart 21 will quickly lead to a resolution of the controversy .
" this divides the city right now , " he said .
" i have the hope that one day , very soon , this all calms down . "

but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .

" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : debate surrounds google 's plans for street view in germany deadline looms for germans to blur homes from google street view why oberstaufen , a southern german town , supports google street view google responds to street view criticism in germany google seeks to ease german opposition to street view privacy -pipe- 13.10.2010 street view brings privacy debate to german mainstream , blogger says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view made privacy a concern of millions of germans street view represents germany 's first real discussion about online privacy , said markus beckedahl , editor of the influential blog netzpolitik .
but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister urges google to disclose opt-out numbers german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is urging the internet giant google to disclose the number of people who have chosen to opt out of its street view service .

but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.10.2010 xenophobic attitudes in germany at high level großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study says germans are suspicious of muslims a new study shows that a worryingly high proportion of germans agree with statements expressing anti-foreigner positions .
islam and muslims are met with particular reservations . the study released wednesday called " right-wing extremism in germany 2010 " argues that extreme views have penetrated to the heart of german society .
but , although between 10 and 20 percent of the population approve of traditional far-right positions such as the need for a dictator , or say that the nazis were n't so bad after all , policy makers will be more alarmed at the high levels of approval given to statements expressing disapproval of foreigners in germany .
for example , 32 percent approve of the statement that " when there 's a shortage of jobs , foreigners should be sent back home ; " 34 percent agree or strongly agree with the statement that " foreigners only come here to exploit germany 's social welfare system ; " and 35 percent think that " germany has a dangerous level of foreign influence as a result of the many foreigners in the country . "
in each of these cases , approval was considerably higher in the former east germany than in the former west .
majority critical of islam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not only neo-nazis who hold extremist views the survey , which was carried out by a team of researchers from the university of leipzig for the friedrich ebert foundation , which is linked to the social democratic party , also found high levels of chauvinism across the board , with some 27 percent of the population thinking that the main task of the german government should be " to ensure that germany gets the power and influence it is entitled to . "
but extreme views turned into majority opinions when it came to islam , with 55 percent saying they could understand that people find arabs unpleasant , and 58 percent saying that the practice of the muslim religion should be " considerably restricted . "
indeed , an absolute majority of those who otherwise did not hold extremist views agreed with these two statements .
the survey was carried out in april , before the latest controversy over the role of islam in german society .
the researchers have carried out a similar survey every two years since 2002 , and , after the figures for 2008 -lrb- during an economic boom -rrb- turned out to be considerably lower than those of the years before , this year 's figures have returned roughly to the norm .
although the researchers argue that the survey proves that right-wing extremist views have reached the " middle " of society , their own figures show that such views are far more prevalent among the elderly , the poorly educated and the unemployed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.10.2010 opinion : in the security council , germany should focus on what 's doable großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's washington correspondent says if germany wants to accomplish anything meaningful during its two-year term on the united nations security council , it must be realistic about what it can achieve . germany will not be able to work wonders in the security council .
that 's made impossible by the mere structure of the body .
the five veto-wielding powers - the united states , russia , china , france and great britain - literally have the last word .
but german foreign minister guido westerwelle still has reason to celebrate .
the last time germany sat on the security council , the united states attempted to legitimize the iraq war under international law . its efforts failed , in part due to germany 's skepticism and rejection of the idea .
the non-permanent members are not completely powerless . after all , resolutions can only be passed with a majority vote of nine of the body 's 15 members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change may become an issue of national security germany also has a certain weight in the security council , because as a large country it already possesses the infrastructure that is necessary for this kind of task .
if one includes the former communist east germany , germany has occupied a seat on the security council six times .
the german diplomats in new york , above all ambassador peter wittig , do n't need to learn how policy is made in the un because they 've already been there behind the scenes for quite some time .
as a member of the security council , germany can influence the kind of issues that are discussed .
a good opportunity has arisen in climate change , which is a vital issue to many island nations .
germany ran for the seat on that platform , and now it has the chance to raise the issue on the agenda .
in a letter to the un body , several island states have called on the security council to treat it as a priority .
when the threat of floods or droughts forces people to abandon their home country , climate change will become an issue of national security for many nations .
the year 2012 presents an opportunity for germans to advance another issue that is particularly close to their foreign minister 's heart : disarmament and an end to the conflict in the middle east .
a conference is planned , which is meant to approve the establishment of a nuclear weapons-free zone in the region .
that 's a tender subject , because the entire world assumes that israel possesses nuclear weapons without openly acknowledging it , and israel is one of three states that has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
one can only guess where things will go with iran in the nuclear conflict .
in this area , germany has already been involved in negotiations along with the five veto-wielding powers , so far without success . in any case , germany can cast a vote on all resolutions for the next two years .
bildunterschrift : the security council 's structure makes any reform near impossible germany will do well to vote alongside the other european countries on all important decisions .
a seat for the european union , which the coalition agreement between the chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats envisions , is nowhere near becoming a reality .
and that 's ultimately for the best .
in crisis situations , the security council must be able to make decisions quickly .
and the european union is certainly not able to send a representative who would be capable of doing that , at least not yet .
it would be a false conclusion to assume that germany 's non-permanent seat brings it closer to a permanent seat .
efforts to reform the security council have hit a dead end , since the veto-wielding powers have no interest in reducing their own influence .
so over the next two years , germany should focus on the achievable .
and as a non-colonial power , it should advocate for the underrepresented interests of africa , latin america and asia .
then it will have used its seat on the council wisely .

now the eu is pressing for a 2014 end to the subsidies , angering some . in a bid to secure a 2007 law protecting coal mining subsidies during a phasing-out of domestic production through 2018 , union leaders this week called for top-level talks between the german government and mining company rag .
the law may be threatened by the european commission 's push for subsidies to non-competitive hard coal mines throughout the eu to be cut by october 2014 .
the move could greatly affect the german states of north rhine-westphalia and saarland , where five mines employ more than 20,000 miners .

coal regions could become blighted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loss of subsidies could devastate employment in some regions christoph meer , a spokesman for the mining , chemical and energy industrial union , said the 2007 agreement was a compromise based in part on a promise that domestic coal mining subsidies would be ended gradually and without the blight of layoffs .
speeding up the process would lead to " significant increases in unemployment in coal mining regions , " he said .

now the eu is pressing for a 2014 end to the subsidies , angering some . in a bid to secure a 2007 law protecting coal mining subsidies during a phasing-out of domestic production through 2018 , union leaders this week called for top-level talks between the german government and mining company rag .
the law may be threatened by the european commission 's push for subsidies to non-competitive hard coal mines throughout the eu to be cut by october 2014 .
the move could greatly affect the german states of north rhine-westphalia and saarland , where five mines employ more than 20,000 miners .
when the agreement to cut subsidies by 2018 was signed into law in 2007 , a clause was included that conditions would be reviewed in 2012 .

the new rules are part of president nicolas sarkozy 's law and order crackdown .
the bill calls for any foreign-born citizens naturalized for less than 10 years to be stripped of their citizenship if convicted of violent crimes against police officers or other public officials .
this punishment currently applies only to terrorism charges .
the new measures would also allow the police to deport foreign nationals , including those from other eu countries , for repeated acts of theft , aggressive begging , or for illegally occupying land - a move that appears to target foreign-born roma gypsies living in france .
in addition , the new law will make it easier to expel any foreigner who is considered a burden on france 's social welfare system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson wants ' good french citizens ' sarkozy 's government drew condemnation from eu officials in recent months for rounding up hundreds of roma from illegal camps and deporting them to romania and bulgaria .
immigration minister eric besson , who proposed the new rules , said he wanted a “ mechanism for producing good french citizens . ”
he hailed the measures , which passed comfortably in the first reading , 294-239 , calling the vote “ a big first step in the building of a european immigration policy . ”
critics , however , claim that the plan will make second-class citizens of immigrants who obtain french nationality .
the draft legislation still has to be put before the senate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 13.10.2010 french lawmakers approve tough rules targeting immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french deputies pursue law and order agenda france ’ s lower house of parliament has passed an immigration bill that would strip naturalized citizens of their citizenship , if convicted of murdering a police officer , judge or other representative of the state . lawmakers in the national assembly approved the measures to strip foreign-born criminals of their french nationality and expel european union citizens for certain crimes .
the new rules are part of president nicolas sarkozy 's law and order crackdown .
the bill calls for any foreign-born citizens naturalized for less than 10 years to be stripped of their citizenship if convicted of violent crimes against police officers or other public officials .
this punishment currently applies only to terrorism charges .
the new measures would also allow the police to deport foreign nationals , including those from other eu countries , for repeated acts of theft , aggressive begging , or for illegally occupying land - a move that appears to target foreign-born roma gypsies living in france .
in addition , the new law will make it easier to expel any foreigner who is considered a burden on france 's social welfare system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson wants ' good french citizens ' sarkozy 's government drew condemnation from eu officials in recent months for rounding up hundreds of roma from illegal camps and deporting them to romania and bulgaria .
immigration minister eric besson , who proposed the new rules , said he wanted a “ mechanism for producing good french citizens . ”
he hailed the measures , which passed comfortably in the first reading , 294-239 , calling the vote “ a big first step in the building of a european immigration policy . ”
critics , however , claim that the plan will make second-class citizens of immigrants who obtain french nationality .
the draft legislation still has to be put before the senate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.10.2010 xenophobic attitudes in germany at high level großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study says germans are suspicious of muslims a new study shows that a worryingly high proportion of germans agree with statements expressing anti-foreigner positions .
islam and muslims are met with particular reservations . the study released wednesday called " right-wing extremism in germany 2010 " argues that extreme views have penetrated to the heart of german society .
but , although between 10 and 20 percent of the population approve of traditional far-right positions such as the need for a dictator , or say that the nazis were n't so bad after all , policy makers will be more alarmed at the high levels of approval given to statements expressing disapproval of foreigners in germany .
for example , 32 percent approve of the statement that " when there 's a shortage of jobs , foreigners should be sent back home ; " 34 percent agree or strongly agree with the statement that " foreigners only come here to exploit germany 's social welfare system ; " and 35 percent think that " germany has a dangerous level of foreign influence as a result of the many foreigners in the country . "
in each of these cases , approval was considerably higher in the former east germany than in the former west .
majority critical of islam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not only neo-nazis who hold extremist views the survey , which was carried out by a team of researchers from the university of leipzig for the friedrich ebert foundation , which is linked to the social democratic party , also found high levels of chauvinism across the board , with some 27 percent of the population thinking that the main task of the german government should be " to ensure that germany gets the power and influence it is entitled to . "
but extreme views turned into majority opinions when it came to islam , with 55 percent saying they could understand that people find arabs unpleasant , and 58 percent saying that the practice of the muslim religion should be " considerably restricted . "
indeed , an absolute majority of those who otherwise did not hold extremist views agreed with these two statements .
the survey was carried out in april , before the latest controversy over the role of islam in german society .
the researchers have carried out a similar survey every two years since 2002 , and , after the figures for 2008 -lrb- during an economic boom -rrb- turned out to be considerably lower than those of the years before , this year 's figures have returned roughly to the norm .
although the researchers argue that the survey proves that right-wing extremist views have reached the " middle " of society , their own figures show that such views are far more prevalent among the elderly , the poorly educated and the unemployed .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .

islam and muslims are met with particular reservations . the study released wednesday called " right-wing extremism in germany 2010 " argues that extreme views have penetrated to the heart of german society .
but , although between 10 and 20 percent of the population approve of traditional far-right positions such as the need for a dictator , or say that the nazis were n't so bad after all , policy makers will be more alarmed at the high levels of approval given to statements expressing disapproval of foreigners in germany .
for example , 32 percent approve of the statement that " when there 's a shortage of jobs , foreigners should be sent back home ; " 34 percent agree or strongly agree with the statement that " foreigners only come here to exploit germany 's social welfare system ; " and 35 percent think that " germany has a dangerous level of foreign influence as a result of the many foreigners in the country .

"
but extreme views turned into majority opinions when it came to islam , with 55 percent saying they could understand that people find arabs unpleasant , and 58 percent saying that the practice of the muslim religion should be " considerably restricted . "
indeed , an absolute majority of those who otherwise did not hold extremist views agreed with these two statements .
the survey was carried out in april , before the latest controversy over the role of islam in german society .
the researchers have carried out a similar survey every two years since 2002 , and , after the figures for 2008 -lrb- during an economic boom -rrb- turned out to be considerably lower than those of the years before , this year 's figures have returned roughly to the norm .
although the researchers argue that the survey proves that right-wing extremist views have reached the " middle " of society , their own figures show that such views are far more prevalent among the elderly , the poorly educated and the unemployed .

the survey was carried out in april , before the latest controversy over the role of islam in german society .
the researchers have carried out a similar survey every two years since 2002 , and , after the figures for 2008 -lrb- during an economic boom -rrb- turned out to be considerably lower than those of the years before , this year 's figures have returned roughly to the norm .
although the researchers argue that the survey proves that right-wing extremist views have reached the " middle " of society , their own figures show that such views are far more prevalent among the elderly , the poorly educated and the unemployed .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 13.10.2010 syrian court strikes back in un hariri probe with own arrest warrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafiq hariri was killed by a car bomb attack in beirut in 2005 a syrian court allegedly issues arrest warrants against 33 officials , including former un investigator detlev mehlis , involved in the international probe into the assassination of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri . the potential for an escalation in tensions surrounding the un-backed investigation into the murder of rafiq hariri increased dramatically last week when a damascus court allegedly issued arrest warrants against individuals it claims misled the international tribunal .
it is claimed that the syrian court has ordered the arrest of 33 people including detlev mehlis , the german prosecutor who led the early stages of the un investigation , accusing a wide range of officials of giving false testimony to the un tribunal .
according to general jamil al-sayyed , the former head of lebanon 's security services who was imprisoned for over four years on suspicion of being involved in hariri 's killing , a senior judge in damascus has issued arrest warrants " against judges , security officers , politicians , journalists and other lebanese , arab and foreign officials and individuals " involved in the investigation into the 2005 assassination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayyed issued his complaint to the court in damascus along with mehlis , the officials targeted by the damascus court include ashraf rifi , lebanon 's chief of police , top prosecutor saeed mirza , former justice minister charles rizk and abdel halim khadda , syria 's exiled former vice president .
sayyed , who along with three other suspects in hariri 's murder was released last year due to lack of evidence , lodged a complaint with the damascus court claiming that the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- was based on fabricated testimony aimed at implicating syria and its supporters in lebanon .
sayyed claims that lebanese officials had refused to consider his complaint and that the un had also rejected his accusations , leading to him submitting his case to the court in damascus .
german prosecutor rejects claims the investigation led by mehlis , the commissioner of the un international independent investigation commission -lrb- uniiic -rrb- between 2005 and 2006 and author of two reports that implicated lebanese and syrian military intelligence in the assassination , has regularly been cited by syria and the shiite militant group hezbollah in their attempts to discredit the entire process .
the arrest warrant suggests that as tensions around the probe increase so will the campaign against mehlis and his work on the case .
mehlis rejected the claims that an arrest warrant had been issued against him and told deutsche welle that he was unaware of what basis any such warrant would have .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehlis and his investigation have been attacked by critics " i do not have the slightest idea what basis , if any , syria has for issuing an arrest warrant and i have not received any official notification from anyone , including the un and my own government on the actual existence of a syrian arrest warrant against me , " he said .
" if indeed an arrest warrant exists among others against the former lebanese justice minister , the chief of police the general prosecutor and above all witnesses in the assassination case , i would consider this as interference in the ongoing investigation . "
when asked if the arrest warrants added weight to the belief that damascus was somehow involved in hariri 's death and that syria was trying to further discredit the investigation , mehlis said : " you certainly have to wonder for what reason a country is so determined to get rid of an independent judicial process . "
heiko wimmen , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , questioned the legitimacy of the warrants and the sources behind the evidence supporting them . " it is next to impossible to judge whether or not there is reliable factual evidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" the fact is that , during the early phase , the statements of witnesses with doubtful credentials were given more credit than they seemed to deserve .
with hindsight , it appears difficult to avoid the conclusion that during that phase , the investigation was determined to indict the syrian regime or a certain faction within it , and was therefore ready to accept evidence at face value that should have been probed more thoroughly . " " the syrians and their lebanese allies claim that this was not merely a result of negligence or bias on the side of the tribunal , but that these ' false witnesses ' were in fact ' fabricated ' by people close to hariri - the group against which the syrians now issued the warrants .
at least one of the ' false witnesses ' defected to syria in late 2005 , retracted his statements , and claimed that he was threatened and bribed into making them , so it is possible that the syrian warrants are based on these statements . "
arrest warrants part of a wider plan of disruption " the arrest warrants are part of a concerted effort to undermine confidence and faith in the stl , " nadim shehadi , a middle east expert at the royal institute of international affairs , chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" it is succeeding to a certain extent because it is diverting attention to side issues . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut was paralyzed by strikes , riots and bombings in 2007 " the question is not really about the warrants but about the stl which is an instrument of international protection over lebanon .
when it was set up , the country was under siege with parliament paralysed , the town center was occupied by the opposition , assassinations were regularly occurring , terror attacks and threats were ongoing .
the failure of the stl would be the failure of this protection . it is the un that is on trial as much as the perpetrators of the crimes in lebanon - it is a test of whether international legality exists and can provide such protection . " " making this move now is obviously part of a larger campaign , waged by hezbollah and syria , to discredit the tribunal and ultimately , to scrap it altogether , ahead of the expected indictments , which according to unofficial information will implicate members of hezbollah , " said heiko wimmen .
" it is a message to hariri that all his attempts to reconcile with damascus will not do as long as he refuses to disown the tribunal . " the stl has been investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result . syria-lebanon relations likely to suffer further relations between lebanon and syria had been slowly normalizing since rafiq hariri 's death , as indicated by syrian president basher al-assad 's visit to lebanon in august and lebanese prime minister saad hariri 's efforts to improve the relationship between the two countries over the past year , even going as far as saying that he had been wrong to implicate syria in the death of his father .
however further tensions seem likely as a result of this week 's visit to beirut by iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad who is seen as a staunch supporter of hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between saad hariri and assad 's syria may unravel the visit and news of the arrest warrants are likely to strike a new blow to relations between damascus and beirut which are once again becoming strained over reports that the stl is ready to indict members of hezbollah in connection with hariri 's murder . just as significantly , it could also alter the course of the stl 's investigation and any subsequent prosecutions . " syria did not issue these arrest warrants , " said nadim shehadi .
" the announcement was made by the press office of general jamil sayyid .
an official syrian statement dismissing the importance of the warrants came a couple of days later . " " however , what is relevant in this affair is that it is an emphatic ' no ' from damascus to saad hariri 's offer of a compromise with both hezbollah and syria .
the compromise involves putting everything related to the assassinations in a box called ' the tribunal ' and carrying on with normal relations . " " also if there is any indictment of hezbollah members or syrians , hariri explicitly said that they would then be considered as rogue elements and not taken to implicate any others . the offer thus uses the stl as an instrument of stability rather than that of instability . the fact that the arrest warrants include most of saad hariri 's entourage and advisors means that the syrians will accept nothing less than abolition of the stl .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .

"
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .

writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 13.10.2010 hochtief prepares defense against spanish takeover bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction giant hochtief employs 55,000 people spain 's acs construction has grown rapidly in recent years , and is seeking to expand further by acquiring germany 's hochtief .
meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : debate surrounds google 's plans for street view in germany deadline looms for germans to blur homes from google street view why oberstaufen , a southern german town , supports google street view street view brings privacy debate to german mainstream , blogger says google seeks to ease german opposition to street view privacy -pipe- 13.10.2010 google responds to street view criticism in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is n't saying how many germans opted-out in an e-mail interview with dw , a google germany spokesperson , lena wagner , says that the company takes privacy " very seriously , " and that it plans on expanding the service . google has said that it will launch street view in germany 's 20 biggest cities - including berlin , munich , cologne , hamburg and bonn - before the end of the year .
due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : debate surrounds google 's plans for street view in germany deadline looms for germans to blur homes from google street view why oberstaufen , a southern german town , supports google street view google responds to street view criticism in germany google seeks to ease german opposition to street view privacy -pipe- 13.10.2010 street view brings privacy debate to german mainstream , blogger says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view made privacy a concern of millions of germans street view represents germany 's first real discussion about online privacy , said markus beckedahl , editor of the influential blog netzpolitik .
but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister urges google to disclose opt-out numbers german consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is urging the internet giant google to disclose the number of people who have chosen to opt out of its street view service .

but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

union members voted overwhelmingly on tuesday to extend their industrial action into wednesday and followed through with their threats to shut down some train services and stop fuel deliveries .
the sncf national rail company , which ran just one-in-three trains on tuesday , said service would likely be as badly disrupted on wednesday as the day before .
international train travel , however , was expected to return to normal with the eurostar service unaffected and many other trains running at almost normal levels to other destinations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel workers near marseille joined the protests pinch already being felt at the pump refinery workers , on the other hand , blocked fuel supplies at eight refineries , including all of oil major total 's six refineries in france , the cgt union said .
unions said some local fuel depots were also struck , raising the risk of shortages at fuel pumps , if the strike action continues .
an ongoing strike of oil terminals at the mediterranean port of marseille has left dozens of oil tankers and cargo ships waiting outside the harbor to be unloaded .
the stoppage has already led to diesel supplies running out on the island of corsica .
the french oil lobby ufip said on tuesday that gasoline stations on the mainland could start to see shortages in just over a week , if the strike continues .
tuesday 's nationwide protests were the biggest since the pension reform battle began earlier this year , despite widely varying estimates from police and trade unions of how many people took part . unions spoke of some 3.5 million demonstrators , while police said the figure was more like 1.2 million .
the pension reforms , which would raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 , are a cornerstone of president nicolas sarkozy 's domestic political agenda , who has vowed not to back down , despite the protests .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 13.10.2010 eu hopes to charge trucks for air and noise pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no shortage of trucks on its highways a long-disputed proposal for taxing road haulage companies for air and noise pollution could gain momentum this week when eu transportation ministers meet to try and end a two-year deadlock . european union transportation ministers meeting in brussels to amend the " eurovignette " directive could strike a deal on friday to make truck operators pay a pollution fee .
but they are n't expected to approve a more controversial proposal on a congestion charge .
the ministers have been discussing changes to the directive for more than two years .
among the contentious issues : charging truckers for environmental damage , which is n't mandatory under the current legislation .
air and noise pollution the new rules would require truck operators to pay for the air and noise pollution caused by their vehicles , in addition to the tolls they 're already paying for road building and repair .
the additional costs could be as high as 0.5 euro cents per kilometer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truckers already pay a toll to use german autobahns germany already has a toll system for heavy goods vehicles and currently charges between 17 and 18 cents per kilometer , according to adolf zobel , managing director of the german freight and waste trucking association -lrb- bgl -rrb- .
a part of the fee goes to air and noise pollution infrastructure measures such as noise-reducing asphalt and noise retention walls , he told deutsche welle .
while zobel acknowledges the reasons for charging a pollution fee , he objects to the current proposal that would allow eu member states to decide how the revenue should be spent .
" we say it must go entirely to infrastructure , including air and noise pollution measures ; roads need to have their own financing system , " he said .
" but brussels is considering allowing member states to use the money as they please . "
bgl and nearly all other european trucking associations object to the proposed road congestion charge .
and they 're not alone .
numerous national governments , worried about compounding truckers ' expenses , oppose the plan as well to win them over , the eu has weakened the proposal .
under a compromise now on the table , any congestion fee would have to be " revenue neutral " .
that means if national authorities , for instance , charge truckers higher tolls to use roads in peak hours , then they would have to reduce off-peak tolls by the same amount .
all watered down " a big problem with the revenue-neutral idea is that a lot of truckers really ca n't decide at what time of the day they can drive , " zobel said .
" that decision is often made by their customers . "
nor are environmental groups excited about the current proposal – but for a completely different reason .
" everything has been watered down , " said nina renshaw , deputy director of transport and environment , an organization that promotes the " polluter-pays " principle .
" it 's really important that congestion be part of the new directive . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congestion is a popular word in germany around vacation time congestion , she told deutsche welle , is a significant contributor to both air and noise pollution , so a mandatory fee aimed at reducing it only makes sense .
the eurovignette directive was first adopted in 1993 .
it was revised in 2006 before member states ’ squabbling over further changes brought talks to a standstill in 2008 .
the directive was put back on the european policy agenda by belgium , which has taken over the six-month rotating presidency of the council of the eu .
if the transportation ministers reach an agreement on amending the directive , then the proposed legislation must go to the european parliament for final approval .

if the trials are successful , the eurostar monoply on the route could become a thing of the past . a train belonging to german rail operator deutsche bahn entered the channel tunnel that connects england with mainland europe for the first time on wednesday .
the ice3 train , built by the german company siemens , threatens to rival the monopoly held by the french-built eurostar train . since the trains still lack approval for the route between france and britain , they were pulled by a locomotive .
on board were staff from deutsche bahn and tunnel operator eurotunnel plus a technical team , but no passengers .
end of an era ?
the ice train was the first passenger train not operated by eurostar to use the tunnel , after eu rules required the tunnel be opened to competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurostar trains have had a monopoly on the tunnel france , which owns 55 percent of the cross-channel eurostar service , has reacted angrily to the company decision last week to buy trains worth about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 836 million -rrb- from siemens , rather than the french company alstom .
testing continues the train went only part of the way through the tunnel before returning to france .
a full trip to london is scheduled for next week .
deutsche bahn plans to offer passengers a high-speed connection with ice trains through the tunnel under the english channel by the end of 2013 .
about nine million passengers travel each year on the eurotstar train routes that connect brussels , london and paris .

if the trials are successful , the eurostar monoply on the route could become a thing of the past . a train belonging to german rail operator deutsche bahn entered the channel tunnel that connects england with mainland europe for the first time on wednesday .
the ice3 train , built by the german company siemens , threatens to rival the monopoly held by the french-built eurostar train . since the trains still lack approval for the route between france and britain , they were pulled by a locomotive .
on board were staff from deutsche bahn and tunnel operator eurotunnel plus a technical team , but no passengers .
end of an era ?
the ice train was the first passenger train not operated by eurostar to use the tunnel , after eu rules required the tunnel be opened to competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurostar trains have had a monopoly on the tunnel france , which owns 55 percent of the cross-channel eurostar service , has reacted angrily to the company decision last week to buy trains worth about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 836 million -rrb- from siemens , rather than the french company alstom .
testing continues the train went only part of the way through the tunnel before returning to france .
a full trip to london is scheduled for next week .
deutsche bahn plans to offer passengers a high-speed connection with ice trains through the tunnel under the english channel by the end of 2013 .
about nine million passengers travel each year on the eurotstar train routes that connect brussels , london and paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 13.10.2010 american fiction is germany 's preferred bedtime reading großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jonathan franzen is promoting his new book " freedom " in germany us writer jonathan franzen is currently promoting his latest bestselling novel in germany , where - for a variety of reasons - american writers tend to outsell home-grown talent . jonathan franzen has been having a hard time of it recently .
first , he had his spectacles stolen at a launch party in london for his new novel " freedom . "
then it transpired that the wrong draft of the book had been published in britain and an entire print run of 80,000 copies had to be pulped . but the rapturous reception he was given at the frankfurt book fair last week no doubt provided some comfort .
" he was surrounded by an entourage of admirers wherever he went , " said german author and illustrator nadia budde , who was there to pick up a german youth literature award . the media circus has continued to dog him on his current reading tour .
the interest he 's generating is no surprise given how well " freedom , " which took him nine years to complete , is doing in germany .
when it was published in translation last month , it shot straight into the top five on the spiegel bestseller list and his readings this week are all sold out . dead or - very much - alive ? not least because franzen spent time in berlin as a fulbright scholar , germany has always had a very soft spot for him .
but not only him - a visit to any german bookstore provides ample evidence that readers in the land of " poets and thinkers " ca n't seem to get enough of american fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the novel dead ?
" people here take literature very seriously , " franzen told journalists in frankfurt over the weekend . but why specifically american literature , especially when many believe it 's seen better days ?
us critic lee siegel triggered a storm of controversy this summer when he pronounced the american novel dead in an article for the new york observer . " fiction has become culturally irrelevant , " he railed .
" for about a million reasons , fiction has now become a museum-piece genre , most of whose practitioners are more like cripplingly self-conscious curators or theoreticians than writers . " german readers beg to differ .
" contemporary us literature is just more diverse and original than its german equivalent , " observed heinz ickstadt from the john f. kennedy institute for north american studies in berlin . the rock-n-roll factor a big fan of american writers , nadia budde feels that they have a lightness of touch that their german counterparts lack - and that in comparison , german fiction is indeed a " museum-piece genre . " " you can always see how carefully -lsb- german -rsb- novels have been constructed , polished and controlled , " she said , pointing to writers such as daniel kehlmann , " whereas there 's something very rock and roll about novels by us writers like franzen , jeffrey eugenides , michael chabon and david foster wallace .
they have something unbridled about them , something very free and easy , effortless , cool and crazy - something that germans long to have but just do n't . " like many of his contemporaries , franzen certainly writes with a visceral edge .
" my idea of a novel is something that has an emotional impact , so what i do is to go to the places where we feel the strongest emotions , " said franzen .
" -lsb- as a writer -rsb- you try and get energy going in a book , and you reach for the content that has its own intrinsic energy .
what you want is to make the pages come alive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us authors are edgier than their german counterparts he and his peers can make german writing look very heavy-handed - especially when it 's aiming for humor .
" as close as it is to reality , us literature is not as naked and stark - reading contemporary german writing can sometimes feel like having things pointed out to you under a neon light , " said budde . love-hate relationship with the us what also makes germany such an enthusiastic market for us writers is the innate familiarity to germans of today 's america .
even though the trans-atlantic relationship suffered during the bush administration , to germany the us still represents the new world .
over the years , it 's lost none of its sheen . " despite all the criticism that exists against the us , it 's still the land of opportunity to us , " said budde , " not just in terms of money and success , but also as a country that 's home to an incredible mix of nationalities . "
historically , of course , it 's also a country where immigrants could reinvent themselves and shrug off their past . so while us writers like franzen and john irving are happy to wear influences such as stendhal , dickens and tolstoy on their sleeves , they also manage to create what franzen calls " enveloping narratives " that take on their own momentum . in contrast , " contemporary german writers just seem so very weighed down by european history and literary classics , " observed budde . but ultimately , the dominance of us fiction in the german book market could also have more prosaic reasons .
in literature as in cinema , it 's america that calls the shots in germany . " it has a lot to do with the structure of book markets , " said heinz ickstadt .
" big names inevitably work their magic , and the german book market does n't want to be seen to be limping behind when it comes to getting out the latest thomas pynchon or richard powers .
potential bestsellers are always going to be a temptation . " author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many believe the hooligans to be part of an organized movement to ruin serbia 's reputation in europe . serbian officials expressed fear of a right-wing extremist plot against their country 's entry to the european union , after serbian soccer hooligans clashed with italian police tuesday evening at the two countries ' euro 2012 qualifying game .
" obviously somebody wants to demonstrate that serbia is neither ready , nor mature enough to go to europe , " justice ministry state secretary , slobodan homen , said wednesday in an interview with tv b92 .
at least sixteen people were hospitalized and 17 serb fans arrested in the northern italian city of genoa after violent riots caused a 40-minute delay to the match and then forced the game to be abandoned six minutes in .
part of a bigger plot the president of the serbian football organization fss , tomislav karadzic , said the riots were organized in belgrade , well ahead of the match .
" we have had hints that this would happen .
these kids are just the executors , those who ordered this are in belgrade , " he told serbian reporters after the game was abandoned , adding , " the state must react . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent right-extremist turned belgrade 's pride parade into a battleground the serb hooligans are believed by many to be part of an organized , ultra-nationalist movement to damage serbia 's chances at eu accession , according to german press agency dpa 's belgrade correspondent boris babic , who told deutsche welle that serbia fears further damage to its reputation .
babic said the soccer hooligans were part of the same movement that rioted in protest at belgrade 's pride parade , adding that there was a " group of maybe 500 individuals who are at the core of every violent event in the country since the 1990s . "
he believes the hooligans to be mafia pawns , rather than true sports fans .
" these criminal organizations have used football for drug smuggling , for an exercise of political influence and whatever can be drawn from their position of power .
they mostly get away without being sentenced to prison , " he said .
hooligans threw flares at the players two police officers and 14 fans were injured in clashes after the game .
police seized clubs and knives from serb hooligans , who also hurled flares onto the pitch .

meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 13.10.2010 xenophobic attitudes in germany at high level großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study says germans are suspicious of muslims a new study shows that a worryingly high proportion of germans agree with statements expressing anti-foreigner positions .
islam and muslims are met with particular reservations . the study released wednesday called " right-wing extremism in germany 2010 " argues that extreme views have penetrated to the heart of german society .
but , although between 10 and 20 percent of the population approve of traditional far-right positions such as the need for a dictator , or say that the nazis were n't so bad after all , policy makers will be more alarmed at the high levels of approval given to statements expressing disapproval of foreigners in germany .
for example , 32 percent approve of the statement that " when there 's a shortage of jobs , foreigners should be sent back home ; " 34 percent agree or strongly agree with the statement that " foreigners only come here to exploit germany 's social welfare system ; " and 35 percent think that " germany has a dangerous level of foreign influence as a result of the many foreigners in the country . "
in each of these cases , approval was considerably higher in the former east germany than in the former west .
majority critical of islam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not only neo-nazis who hold extremist views the survey , which was carried out by a team of researchers from the university of leipzig for the friedrich ebert foundation , which is linked to the social democratic party , also found high levels of chauvinism across the board , with some 27 percent of the population thinking that the main task of the german government should be " to ensure that germany gets the power and influence it is entitled to . "
but extreme views turned into majority opinions when it came to islam , with 55 percent saying they could understand that people find arabs unpleasant , and 58 percent saying that the practice of the muslim religion should be " considerably restricted . "
indeed , an absolute majority of those who otherwise did not hold extremist views agreed with these two statements .
the survey was carried out in april , before the latest controversy over the role of islam in german society .
the researchers have carried out a similar survey every two years since 2002 , and , after the figures for 2008 -lrb- during an economic boom -rrb- turned out to be considerably lower than those of the years before , this year 's figures have returned roughly to the norm .
although the researchers argue that the survey proves that right-wing extremist views have reached the " middle " of society , their own figures show that such views are far more prevalent among the elderly , the poorly educated and the unemployed .

the pension reforms , which would raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 , are a cornerstone of president nicolas sarkozy 's domestic political agenda , who has vowed not to back down , despite the protests .

the new rules are part of president nicolas sarkozy 's law and order crackdown .
the bill calls for any foreign-born citizens naturalized for less than 10 years to be stripped of their citizenship if convicted of violent crimes against police officers or other public officials .
this punishment currently applies only to terrorism charges .
the new measures would also allow the police to deport foreign nationals , including those from other eu countries , for repeated acts of theft , aggressive begging , or for illegally occupying land - a move that appears to target foreign-born roma gypsies living in france .
in addition , the new law will make it easier to expel any foreigner who is considered a burden on france 's social welfare system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 13.10.2010 social services still struggling to break through to uk muslim youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups aim to help muslim boys and girls young british muslims are still reluctant to get the help they need from mainstream counseling services for fear of being misunderstood , says the muslim youth helpline , which helps young muslims cope with their issues . an organization in britain has set out to offer a support service to young muslims who are without a shoulder to lean on .
but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

if the trials are successful , the eurostar monoply on the route could become a thing of the past . a train belonging to german rail operator deutsche bahn entered the channel tunnel that connects england with mainland europe for the first time on wednesday .
the ice3 train , built by the german company siemens , threatens to rival the monopoly held by the french-built eurostar train . since the trains still lack approval for the route between france and britain , they were pulled by a locomotive .
on board were staff from deutsche bahn and tunnel operator eurotunnel plus a technical team , but no passengers .
end of an era ?
the ice train was the first passenger train not operated by eurostar to use the tunnel , after eu rules required the tunnel be opened to competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurostar trains have had a monopoly on the tunnel france , which owns 55 percent of the cross-channel eurostar service , has reacted angrily to the company decision last week to buy trains worth about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 836 million -rrb- from siemens , rather than the french company alstom .
testing continues the train went only part of the way through the tunnel before returning to france .
a full trip to london is scheduled for next week .
deutsche bahn plans to offer passengers a high-speed connection with ice trains through the tunnel under the english channel by the end of 2013 .
about nine million passengers travel each year on the eurotstar train routes that connect brussels , london and paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : debate surrounds google 's plans for street view in germany deadline looms for germans to blur homes from google street view why oberstaufen , a southern german town , supports google street view google responds to street view criticism in germany google seeks to ease german opposition to street view privacy -pipe- 13.10.2010 street view brings privacy debate to german mainstream , blogger says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view made privacy a concern of millions of germans street view represents germany 's first real discussion about online privacy , said markus beckedahl , editor of the influential blog netzpolitik .
but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

if the trials are successful , the eurostar monoply on the route could become a thing of the past . a train belonging to german rail operator deutsche bahn entered the channel tunnel that connects england with mainland europe for the first time on wednesday .
the ice3 train , built by the german company siemens , threatens to rival the monopoly held by the french-built eurostar train . since the trains still lack approval for the route between france and britain , they were pulled by a locomotive .
on board were staff from deutsche bahn and tunnel operator eurotunnel plus a technical team , but no passengers .

islam and muslims are met with particular reservations . the study released wednesday called " right-wing extremism in germany 2010 " argues that extreme views have penetrated to the heart of german society .

for example , 32 percent approve of the statement that " when there 's a shortage of jobs , foreigners should be sent back home ; " 34 percent agree or strongly agree with the statement that " foreigners only come here to exploit germany 's social welfare system ; " and 35 percent think that " germany has a dangerous level of foreign influence as a result of the many foreigners in the country .

indeed , an absolute majority of those who otherwise did not hold extremist views agreed with these two statements .

although the researchers argue that the survey proves that right-wing extremist views have reached the " middle " of society , their own figures show that such views are far more prevalent among the elderly , the poorly educated and the unemployed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 13.10.2010 hochtief prepares defense against spanish takeover bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction giant hochtief employs 55,000 people spain 's acs construction has grown rapidly in recent years , and is seeking to expand further by acquiring germany 's hochtief .
meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 13.10.2010 american fiction is germany 's preferred bedtime reading großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jonathan franzen is promoting his new book " freedom " in germany us writer jonathan franzen is currently promoting his latest bestselling novel in germany , where - for a variety of reasons - american writers tend to outsell home-grown talent . jonathan franzen has been having a hard time of it recently .
first , he had his spectacles stolen at a launch party in london for his new novel " freedom . "
then it transpired that the wrong draft of the book had been published in britain and an entire print run of 80,000 copies had to be pulped . but the rapturous reception he was given at the frankfurt book fair last week no doubt provided some comfort .
" he was surrounded by an entourage of admirers wherever he went , " said german author and illustrator nadia budde , who was there to pick up a german youth literature award . the media circus has continued to dog him on his current reading tour .
the interest he 's generating is no surprise given how well " freedom , " which took him nine years to complete , is doing in germany .
when it was published in translation last month , it shot straight into the top five on the spiegel bestseller list and his readings this week are all sold out . dead or - very much - alive ? not least because franzen spent time in berlin as a fulbright scholar , germany has always had a very soft spot for him .
but not only him - a visit to any german bookstore provides ample evidence that readers in the land of " poets and thinkers " ca n't seem to get enough of american fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the novel dead ?
" people here take literature very seriously , " franzen told journalists in frankfurt over the weekend . but why specifically american literature , especially when many believe it 's seen better days ?
us critic lee siegel triggered a storm of controversy this summer when he pronounced the american novel dead in an article for the new york observer . " fiction has become culturally irrelevant , " he railed .
" for about a million reasons , fiction has now become a museum-piece genre , most of whose practitioners are more like cripplingly self-conscious curators or theoreticians than writers . " german readers beg to differ .
" contemporary us literature is just more diverse and original than its german equivalent , " observed heinz ickstadt from the john f. kennedy institute for north american studies in berlin . the rock-n-roll factor a big fan of american writers , nadia budde feels that they have a lightness of touch that their german counterparts lack - and that in comparison , german fiction is indeed a " museum-piece genre . " " you can always see how carefully -lsb- german -rsb- novels have been constructed , polished and controlled , " she said , pointing to writers such as daniel kehlmann , " whereas there 's something very rock and roll about novels by us writers like franzen , jeffrey eugenides , michael chabon and david foster wallace .
they have something unbridled about them , something very free and easy , effortless , cool and crazy - something that germans long to have but just do n't . " like many of his contemporaries , franzen certainly writes with a visceral edge .
" my idea of a novel is something that has an emotional impact , so what i do is to go to the places where we feel the strongest emotions , " said franzen .
" -lsb- as a writer -rsb- you try and get energy going in a book , and you reach for the content that has its own intrinsic energy .
what you want is to make the pages come alive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us authors are edgier than their german counterparts he and his peers can make german writing look very heavy-handed - especially when it 's aiming for humor .
" as close as it is to reality , us literature is not as naked and stark - reading contemporary german writing can sometimes feel like having things pointed out to you under a neon light , " said budde . love-hate relationship with the us what also makes germany such an enthusiastic market for us writers is the innate familiarity to germans of today 's america .
even though the trans-atlantic relationship suffered during the bush administration , to germany the us still represents the new world .
over the years , it 's lost none of its sheen . " despite all the criticism that exists against the us , it 's still the land of opportunity to us , " said budde , " not just in terms of money and success , but also as a country that 's home to an incredible mix of nationalities . "
historically , of course , it 's also a country where immigrants could reinvent themselves and shrug off their past . so while us writers like franzen and john irving are happy to wear influences such as stendhal , dickens and tolstoy on their sleeves , they also manage to create what franzen calls " enveloping narratives " that take on their own momentum . in contrast , " contemporary german writers just seem so very weighed down by european history and literary classics , " observed budde . but ultimately , the dominance of us fiction in the german book market could also have more prosaic reasons .
in literature as in cinema , it 's america that calls the shots in germany . " it has a lot to do with the structure of book markets , " said heinz ickstadt .
" big names inevitably work their magic , and the german book market does n't want to be seen to be limping behind when it comes to getting out the latest thomas pynchon or richard powers .
potential bestsellers are always going to be a temptation . " author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

first , he had his spectacles stolen at a launch party in london for his new novel " freedom . "
then it transpired that the wrong draft of the book had been published in britain and an entire print run of 80,000 copies had to be pulped . but the rapturous reception he was given at the frankfurt book fair last week no doubt provided some comfort .
" he was surrounded by an entourage of admirers wherever he went , " said german author and illustrator nadia budde , who was there to pick up a german youth literature award . the media circus has continued to dog him on his current reading tour .
the interest he 's generating is no surprise given how well " freedom , " which took him nine years to complete , is doing in germany .
when it was published in translation last month , it shot straight into the top five on the spiegel bestseller list and his readings this week are all sold out . dead or - very much - alive ? not least because franzen spent time in berlin as a fulbright scholar , germany has always had a very soft spot for him .
but not only him - a visit to any german bookstore provides ample evidence that readers in the land of " poets and thinkers " ca n't seem to get enough of american fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the novel dead ?
" people here take literature very seriously , " franzen told journalists in frankfurt over the weekend . but why specifically american literature , especially when many believe it 's seen better days ?
us critic lee siegel triggered a storm of controversy this summer when he pronounced the american novel dead in an article for the new york observer . " fiction has become culturally irrelevant , " he railed .
" for about a million reasons , fiction has now become a museum-piece genre , most of whose practitioners are more like cripplingly self-conscious curators or theoreticians than writers . " german readers beg to differ .
" contemporary us literature is just more diverse and original than its german equivalent , " observed heinz ickstadt from the john f. kennedy institute for north american studies in berlin . the rock-n-roll factor a big fan of american writers , nadia budde feels that they have a lightness of touch that their german counterparts lack - and that in comparison , german fiction is indeed a " museum-piece genre . " " you can always see how carefully -lsb- german -rsb- novels have been constructed , polished and controlled , " she said , pointing to writers such as daniel kehlmann , " whereas there 's something very rock and roll about novels by us writers like franzen , jeffrey eugenides , michael chabon and david foster wallace .
they have something unbridled about them , something very free and easy , effortless , cool and crazy - something that germans long to have but just do n't . " like many of his contemporaries , franzen certainly writes with a visceral edge .
" my idea of a novel is something that has an emotional impact , so what i do is to go to the places where we feel the strongest emotions , " said franzen .
" -lsb- as a writer -rsb- you try and get energy going in a book , and you reach for the content that has its own intrinsic energy .
what you want is to make the pages come alive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us authors are edgier than their german counterparts he and his peers can make german writing look very heavy-handed - especially when it 's aiming for humor .
" as close as it is to reality , us literature is not as naked and stark - reading contemporary german writing can sometimes feel like having things pointed out to you under a neon light , " said budde . love-hate relationship with the us what also makes germany such an enthusiastic market for us writers is the innate familiarity to germans of today 's america .
even though the trans-atlantic relationship suffered during the bush administration , to germany the us still represents the new world .
over the years , it 's lost none of its sheen . " despite all the criticism that exists against the us , it 's still the land of opportunity to us , " said budde , " not just in terms of money and success , but also as a country that 's home to an incredible mix of nationalities . "
historically , of course , it 's also a country where immigrants could reinvent themselves and shrug off their past . so while us writers like franzen and john irving are happy to wear influences such as stendhal , dickens and tolstoy on their sleeves , they also manage to create what franzen calls " enveloping narratives " that take on their own momentum . in contrast , " contemporary german writers just seem so very weighed down by european history and literary classics , " observed budde . but ultimately , the dominance of us fiction in the german book market could also have more prosaic reasons .
in literature as in cinema , it 's america that calls the shots in germany . " it has a lot to do with the structure of book markets , " said heinz ickstadt .
" big names inevitably work their magic , and the german book market does n't want to be seen to be limping behind when it comes to getting out the latest thomas pynchon or richard powers .
potential bestsellers are always going to be a temptation . " author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 13.10.2010 serbia links soccer hooligans to extremist plot after violence in italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hooligans attacked their own national team with flares right-wing extremist serb soccer hooligans sabotaged a national qualifier against italy tuesday in the city of genoa .
many believe the hooligans to be part of an organized movement to ruin serbia 's reputation in europe . serbian officials expressed fear of a right-wing extremist plot against their country 's entry to the european union , after serbian soccer hooligans clashed with italian police tuesday evening at the two countries ' euro 2012 qualifying game .
" obviously somebody wants to demonstrate that serbia is neither ready , nor mature enough to go to europe , " justice ministry state secretary , slobodan homen , said wednesday in an interview with tv b92 .
at least sixteen people were hospitalized and 17 serb fans arrested in the northern italian city of genoa after violent riots caused a 40-minute delay to the match and then forced the game to be abandoned six minutes in .
part of a bigger plot the president of the serbian football organization fss , tomislav karadzic , said the riots were organized in belgrade , well ahead of the match .
" we have had hints that this would happen .
these kids are just the executors , those who ordered this are in belgrade , " he told serbian reporters after the game was abandoned , adding , " the state must react . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent right-extremist turned belgrade 's pride parade into a battleground the serb hooligans are believed by many to be part of an organized , ultra-nationalist movement to damage serbia 's chances at eu accession , according to german press agency dpa 's belgrade correspondent boris babic , who told deutsche welle that serbia fears further damage to its reputation .
babic said the soccer hooligans were part of the same movement that rioted in protest at belgrade 's pride parade , adding that there was a " group of maybe 500 individuals who are at the core of every violent event in the country since the 1990s . "
he believes the hooligans to be mafia pawns , rather than true sports fans .
" these criminal organizations have used football for drug smuggling , for an exercise of political influence and whatever can be drawn from their position of power .
they mostly get away without being sentenced to prison , " he said .
hooligans threw flares at the players two police officers and 14 fans were injured in clashes after the game .
police seized clubs and knives from serb hooligans , who also hurled flares onto the pitch .
italian authorities claim they were not warned by serbia as to the danger posed by the hooligans , who arrived with banners proclaiming " kosovo is ours . "
newspaper reports have disputed the authorities ' claim .
originally , the hooligans had refused to sit in their designated area and had to be herded in by police .
" in the process , they were pushed in without any of them being checked or frisked , " according to world soccer 's rome correspondent , paddy agnew .
bildunterschrift : the hooligans brought in objects ranging from garden shears to firecrackers " these guys got in with all kinds of petards , smoke bombs , metal objects , garden sheers , " he told deutsche welle , adding , " obviously the italian authorities will have to explain how that happened . "
also arrested was an italian fan who attacked serb supporters with a crowbar .
the italian team were wearing black armbands to show solidarity with the families of four italian soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .
before the game , the serbs ’ first choice goalkeeper vladimir stojkovic was attacked by the fans , who threw a flare onto the team bus .
although stojkovic was not seriously injured , he refused to play out of fear , choosing to remain in the dressing room .
serb players may have encouraged hooligans incitement came from within the serb soccer team , according to agnew .
" the footballers made this three-finger signal which means ‘ greater serbia . '
they made that to their own fans , " he told deutsche welle .
italian coach cesare prandelli defended the serb players .
" we asked our opponents to go to their fans to try to calm them down … i do n't know what signs they made but they were clearly afraid , " the trainer said .
' 20 years of neglect ' meanwhile , former yugoslavia international player savo milosevic told belgrade 's b92 television that the violence in genoa was the result of 20 years of government neglect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prandelli defended the serb players , saying they were visibly afraid " the government has been completely disinterested in sport and its problems over the last 20 years , hence serbia is now paying a heavy price for the failure to tackle hooliganism swiftly and decisively , " he said .
tuesday 's rioting is certainly not the first incident of violence by serb hooligans .
in 2008 , after kosovo declared independence from serbia , a chanting crowd of young men left stadium stands to torch the us embassy in belgrade and ransack several others .

union members voted overwhelmingly on tuesday to extend their industrial action into wednesday and followed through with their threats to shut down some train services and stop fuel deliveries .
the sncf national rail company , which ran just one-in-three trains on tuesday , said service would likely be as badly disrupted on wednesday as the day before .
international train travel , however , was expected to return to normal with the eurostar service unaffected and many other trains running at almost normal levels to other destinations .

unions said some local fuel depots were also struck , raising the risk of shortages at fuel pumps , if the strike action continues .
an ongoing strike of oil terminals at the mediterranean port of marseille has left dozens of oil tankers and cargo ships waiting outside the harbor to be unloaded .
the stoppage has already led to diesel supplies running out on the island of corsica .
the french oil lobby ufip said on tuesday that gasoline stations on the mainland could start to see shortages in just over a week , if the strike continues .
tuesday 's nationwide protests were the biggest since the pension reform battle began earlier this year , despite widely varying estimates from police and trade unions of how many people took part . unions spoke of some 3.5 million demonstrators , while police said the figure was more like 1.2 million .
the pension reforms , which would raise the retirement age to 62 from 60 , are a cornerstone of president nicolas sarkozy 's domestic political agenda , who has vowed not to back down , despite the protests .

but it stops short of imposing a moratorium , leaving that up to national states . the eu 's energy commissioner , guenther oettinger , admitted on wednesday , " i 'm a realist , " as he pulled back from a proposed moratorium on new deep-sea oil-drilling which he had supported in july .
on tuesday , the us government had lifted its ban on drilling in the gulf of mexico , which had been imposed followed the disastrous consequences of the explosion of bp 's deepwater horizon rig in the gulf of mexico .
the ban had been expected to run until november , but it had met with strong opposition from the oil industry and politicians in the area affected economically .

they would be responsible for all damage caused within 200 miles of a coastline , instead of the current 12-mile limit .
" we have to make sure that a disaster similar to the one in the gulf of mexico will never happen in european waters , " said oettinger .
the legislation , to harmonize conditions across europe , would be presented early next year .
it would require approval from both the eu ministers and the parliament , and it is already believed that britain will oppose it .
there are few deep-sea rigs in europe , but several are planned in the north sea and the black sea .
further wells are planned in libyan and egyptian waters , where the consequences of any catastrophe would be felt in europe .

the letter was posted on several chinese and english websites on wednesday .
it was later deleted from chatrooms on major portals , possibly by government censors , though it continued to crop up in more obscure chat rooms .
mao 's former secretary among the signatories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's former secretary li rui is among the signatories the letter lists the names of 23 signatories , among them li rui , a former secretary to mao zedong , hu jiwei , the retired editor-in-chief of the communist party newspaper people 's daily , and jiang ping , the retired head of the china university of political science and law .
several other signatories are known for their reformist sympathies .
the main thrust of the bluntly worded letter is that the government should implement article 35 of the chinese constitution approved in 1982 , which allows chinese citizens " freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession and of demonstration " .
the " former avowal and concrete denial " of this right is described as " false democracy " in the letter .
the signatories call upon the government to give editors and journalists the freedom to report without restrictions and to end the system of censors previewing media and book content .
worried about the premier 's rights the letter cites recent examples of censorship , going so far as to state : " even the premier of our country does not have the freedom of speech or of press " .
apparently , the official xinhua news agency did not report comments by premier wen jiabao on political reform made in an important speech last august in the southern city of shenzhen .
as regards the communist party , the letter says that if the party does not reform itself , it will lose its vitality and die a natural death .
chinese citizens have the right to know the errors of the ruling party , the letter says .
leading chinese dissident liu xiaobo was awarded this year 's nobel peace prize last friday , though that event apparently has no direct connection with the group 's letter. ac / dpa / afp editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but while the supporters of the project may be in the minority , they 've also been holding protests which are growing in numbers . in the public debate over the controversial stuttgart 21 rail station renovation , a growing number of people are gathering to counter the massive opposition and show their support for the project .
christian list , organizer of the weekly pro-stuttgart 21 marches , said he thought the opposition had gotten out of hand .
" my beginning as a political activist was when i saw the people yelling and crying " liars ! " to the politicians in stuttgart , " he told deutsche welle .
" it all went a little bit too far .
so that was the moment when i said now is the point when i have to do something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supporters march to city hall every thursday growing in numbers every thursday , list gets together with a number of people and marches along a four-kilometer route to the city hall , where the crowd hears speeches to rally support .
he said the first march brought about 100 people , but that they have grown every week since , and that the most recent march drew 4,000 people .
that is still just a small fraction of the 60,000 to 100,000 people who showed up for the most recent protest against the project last saturday .
but list said the reasons why so many people have mobilized in opposition are not all based on fact .
" the politicians made big mistakes in the communication of this project , " he said .
" my opinion is that the people have too much information and they are overwhelmed by it .
so they just do n't know what is right and what is wrong . "
list said he supports the project because while it may be expensive , the economic benefits of connecting stuttgart to a broader high-speed rail network will eventually bring in even more money .
and although about 280 trees in the palace gardens have to be cut down , the project moves the train station underground , freeing up 100 hectares of land for public space where even more trees will be planted .
arbitration meetings there is little doubt that stuttgart 21 opponents have the loudest voice in the media .
their main complaints are that the renovation cost of 7 billion euros is far too high , and that the construction will damage the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler , left , said he is optimistic the arbitration will continue and they earned some vindication in their first meetings with state-appointed arbitrator heiner geissler on tuesday night , when geissler appeared to chastise state authorities for not being sufficiently transparent .
" all facts , all numbers , and all assessments have to be laid out on the table , " he told reporters .
" that 's the only way the lost trust and credibility can be won back .
and that 's an extremely important goal that we 're working toward in these talks . "
geissler added that he was optimistic that the discussions could continue and eventually reach a solution .
accusations of conflicting interests list runs his own communications firm , and he said working professionally in that field helped him in getting his message out .
but it has also led some people to claim he is not just a regular citizen voicing his opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : list said he hopes for a quick solution to the controversy " there are accusations that i work for -lrb- state rail company -rrb- deutsche bahn , or that i work for the city , that i 'm paid for doing this , " he said .
" and that 's not true .
my agency is working for different customers , but we do n't have deutsche bahn as a customer . "
despite his views on the project , list says his greatest hope is that the arbitration with opponents of stuttgart 21 will quickly lead to a resolution of the controversy .
" this divides the city right now , " he said .
" i have the hope that one day , very soon , this all calms down . "

" my beginning as a political activist was when i saw the people yelling and crying " liars ! " to the politicians in stuttgart , " he told deutsche welle .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supporters march to city hall every thursday growing in numbers every thursday , list gets together with a number of people and marches along a four-kilometer route to the city hall , where the crowd hears speeches to rally support .
he said the first march brought about 100 people , but that they have grown every week since , and that the most recent march drew 4,000 people .
that is still just a small fraction of the 60,000 to 100,000 people who showed up for the most recent protest against the project last saturday .
but list said the reasons why so many people have mobilized in opposition are not all based on fact .
" the politicians made big mistakes in the communication of this project , " he said .
" my opinion is that the people have too much information and they are overwhelmed by it .
so they just do n't know what is right and what is wrong . "
list said he supports the project because while it may be expensive , the economic benefits of connecting stuttgart to a broader high-speed rail network will eventually bring in even more money .
and although about 280 trees in the palace gardens have to be cut down , the project moves the train station underground , freeing up 100 hectares of land for public space where even more trees will be planted .

geissler added that he was optimistic that the discussions could continue and eventually reach a solution .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 13.10.2010 eu hopes to charge trucks for air and noise pollution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has no shortage of trucks on its highways a long-disputed proposal for taxing road haulage companies for air and noise pollution could gain momentum this week when eu transportation ministers meet to try and end a two-year deadlock . european union transportation ministers meeting in brussels to amend the " eurovignette " directive could strike a deal on friday to make truck operators pay a pollution fee .
but they are n't expected to approve a more controversial proposal on a congestion charge .
the ministers have been discussing changes to the directive for more than two years .
among the contentious issues : charging truckers for environmental damage , which is n't mandatory under the current legislation .
air and noise pollution the new rules would require truck operators to pay for the air and noise pollution caused by their vehicles , in addition to the tolls they 're already paying for road building and repair .
the additional costs could be as high as 0.5 euro cents per kilometer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : truckers already pay a toll to use german autobahns germany already has a toll system for heavy goods vehicles and currently charges between 17 and 18 cents per kilometer , according to adolf zobel , managing director of the german freight and waste trucking association -lrb- bgl -rrb- .
a part of the fee goes to air and noise pollution infrastructure measures such as noise-reducing asphalt and noise retention walls , he told deutsche welle .
while zobel acknowledges the reasons for charging a pollution fee , he objects to the current proposal that would allow eu member states to decide how the revenue should be spent .
" we say it must go entirely to infrastructure , including air and noise pollution measures ; roads need to have their own financing system , " he said .
" but brussels is considering allowing member states to use the money as they please . "
bgl and nearly all other european trucking associations object to the proposed road congestion charge .
and they 're not alone .
numerous national governments , worried about compounding truckers ' expenses , oppose the plan as well to win them over , the eu has weakened the proposal .
under a compromise now on the table , any congestion fee would have to be " revenue neutral " .
that means if national authorities , for instance , charge truckers higher tolls to use roads in peak hours , then they would have to reduce off-peak tolls by the same amount .
all watered down " a big problem with the revenue-neutral idea is that a lot of truckers really ca n't decide at what time of the day they can drive , " zobel said .
" that decision is often made by their customers . "
nor are environmental groups excited about the current proposal – but for a completely different reason .
" everything has been watered down , " said nina renshaw , deputy director of transport and environment , an organization that promotes the " polluter-pays " principle .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congestion is a popular word in germany around vacation time congestion , she told deutsche welle , is a significant contributor to both air and noise pollution , so a mandatory fee aimed at reducing it only makes sense .
the eurovignette directive was first adopted in 1993 .
it was revised in 2006 before member states ’ squabbling over further changes brought talks to a standstill in 2008 .
the directive was put back on the european policy agenda by belgium , which has taken over the six-month rotating presidency of the council of the eu .
if the transportation ministers reach an agreement on amending the directive , then the proposed legislation must go to the european parliament for final approval .

but some wonder if such government-funded muslim-targeted support services ultimately reinforce ethnic divisions instead of breaking down barriers .
the muslim youth helpline is a free and confidential service that young muslims across the united kingdom can utilize to talk about any issues they happen to be dealing with .
the organization , which was set up 10 years ago by four young muslim men who had noticed their friends , families and peers did not have anyone to go to for help , relies heavily on trained volunteers .
chief executive akeela ahmed says mainstream counseling services often overlook faith and cultural sensitivities when tackling issues such as forced marriage and sexual abuse , but that seeking advice from relatives or community leaders can be equally problematic for young muslims .
" if they tried to go for help at a community level , on issues like depression or drug abuse , they were either met with a lack of understanding , or an attitude that ' these things we do n't talk about , and you sweep it under the carpet , " ' she says .
" and then they also noticed that if they tried to go to mainstream or statutory support , say to a gp , they were met with a response that did n't really understand their needs . "
non-faith-specific bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hotline helps the victims of abuse the muslim youth helpline mainly hears from young adults and teenagers , but has received calls from children as young as five , or even parents concerned about their children .
ahmed insists the problems they encounter are not just linked to being a muslim , but are often universal .
" it -lsb- can involve -rsb- concerns about boy-girl relationships , concerns about parents , about education , " she says .
" and there are the more difficult and severe problems around mental illness , eating disorders , self-harm and suicide . "
and callers know they will receive a service in which they are not judged or chastised , says ahmed , who cites a frequent scenario of a teenage girl who thinks she might be pregnant to a boyfriend her parents have never met .
while the helpline often refers callers to mainstream support services , it says young british muslims still fear they will be misunderstood .
empowerment the key but some social service experts challenge the value of front-line organizations that flag themselves up as being muslim , arguing that this approach speaks to a small minority of young british muslims who identify themselves by faith alone .
parvin ali , chief executive and founder of the forum for advocacy training in the multicultural arena -lrb- fatima -rrb- , wonders whether some muslims turn to services branded " muslim " hoping to hear an islamic message .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatima aims to empower muslim women fatima works to economically and socially empower women across all ethnic minorities , specifically targeting individuals and their families to help them access education and jobs .
ali says the forum 's message is based on the belief that social integration comes through political and economic empowerment .
she argues that government-funded muslim organizations that only listen to muslims run the risk of working against integration into mainstream society .
" muslims are very quick to say what they want from non-muslims , but very , very slow to actually reciprocate , " ali says .
" it 's never been a two-way integration process , it 's always been , ' you have to let us integrate . '
but they never accept that they have to understand the culture they are actually living in , and see what accommodation they have to make also . "
ali also says that some communities display a low level of trust in their own ethnic services for fear their confidentiality might be breached , which could put them off raising concerns about a radicalized family member .
" people are actually afraid that if they go to a muslim organization and say they have concerns about members of their family , who are radicalized or in danger of being radicalized , the support that they are going to get or the response they are going to get will immediately be out there , and open and that many other people in the community will know about it , " she says .
" no one can get real assurance that if they go to an organization that is from an ethnic minority community that they will feel as safe . "
trust integral but akeela ahmed from the muslim youth helpline insists confidentiality is a fundamental principle underpinning her organization , which she says would intervene if a caller posed a threat to human life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims are said to be among the most marginalized minorities in britain " i 'm sure that any citizen would agree that if someone was posing a threat to another human life , you would have to contact the authorities , " she says .
" on radicalization , we have not had any issue to date in which we 've had to do that . "
ahmed says evidence shows british muslims are more likely to be marginalized than other minorities , showing poorer outcomes in education and mental and physical health .
she says the muslim youth helpline provides proper access to mainstream services , and that this can lead to more opportunities .
" if someone feels more included in society , if they feel they have the same options as other people , i guess they would feel more integrated , " she says .
parvin ali 's fatima network is also working towards that very goal .
while both sides agree that front-line services are essential to integrating muslims , the question is whether their work would be more effective if they were not just for muslims and run by muslims alone .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

but there are other problematic privacy issues worthy of debate , he said . over the last six years , netzpolitik.org has emerged as one of germany 's most popular blogs exploring the intersection of politics and technology.its editor , markus beckedahl , has written extensively about the issue of google street view and its pending launch in germany . beckedahl explained to deutsche welle that while street view hits an emotional nerve , there are larger online privacy issues that germans should be worried about . deutsche welle : after nearly 18 months of discussion , google is going ahead with its street view project and put images of german cities online by the end of 2010 .
is all of this public discussion over privacy much ado about nothing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus beckedahl is the editor of netzpolitik.org markus beckedahl : i do n't think google street view is a debate about nothing .
but it sounds a bit crazy because google street view is n't the biggest privacy problem that we have in germany .
it 's the first privacy debate where a lot of people can feel something about it .
in this debate you have your houses , you can see them .
you can feel how it is when your house is being pictured on the internet .
when it comes to your data it 's something you ca n't really see and you ca n't really feel .
people do n't care about personal data because they have no clue about databases . but now , google street view it 's something where my parents have an opinion about it , and maybe your parents do , too .
this is a new level in that debate .
and i think there is another aspect : that it 's google .
google is the biggest brand in the data industry and google has been very much discussed in the german public and the german media .
most german media are critical of google - so the combination of the big brand google and the perception that they store too much data , including our houses , this is the heart of the german debate on street view . the data protection debate has been going on among experts for a long time in germany .
do you think this is the first time it 's been so prominent in the mainstream ? yeah , it 's the first time that the older people in society are taking notice of internet privacy .
when it comes to other privacy debates in germany , for example , the data retention debate , it 's a debate where more younger people who are using the internet are more engaged in that debate .
now , when it comes to google street view it 's a debate run by older people who are not part of the internet society . do you think the reasons that people have given against google street view make sense - are people 's fears rational and reasonable ? not really .
i think most of the fears are irrational , and i think there are bigger problems concerning privacy issues .
i think there are bigger privacy problems with other google services than there are with google street view .
but the difference between privacy issues of using google mail or using the google search engine and storing all the data for nine months or longer , is totally different from a picture of my house on the internet .
on the other hand , it 's just a new step for google to get more and more information and maybe it 's one step too far .
people fear that google is storing too many different kinds of data on different kinds of services . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she would not remove her home from street view chancellor merkel has said she would not take herself off of street view , while foreign minister guido westerwelle has said he would do everything to stop the service .
how do you see this as playing out in the political sphere ? in the so-called " sommerloch , " the debates over the summer holidays , a lot of people thought that german politicians went crazy in the street view debate .
lots of the politicians who were in favor of more state surveillance were now the biggest privacy activists .
that was totally crazy because most of the other privacy activists thought it 's not a matter of debate - we have bigger problems than google street view and you should n't worry about such a small issue . a lot of politicians used this debate to create a good image of themselves and to tell the people that they understand their feelings and that they will protect them from this big company google from the united states . google has said they 're going to be releasing street view later this year in germany 's 20 biggest cities .
where do you think this issue will go from here ? i 'm not sure .
i think the debate is over .
i think it was a classic sommerloch story - a debate for the summer holidays when nothing else is happening .
i think that when google introduces the service in the first 20 cities , a lot of people will look at it and see how nice it is to see how our neighborhood looks and you can look at other neighborhoods and they will like this kind of service , the same as they like the introduction of google maps or google earth , or other services from other companies . i think there will only be some people who use the opt-out and there will be some people who think that they should opt-in , and so their house will be in the internet in the future so their house can be seen in that service . author : cyrus farivar editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 13.10.2010 syrian court strikes back in un hariri probe with own arrest warrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rafiq hariri was killed by a car bomb attack in beirut in 2005 a syrian court allegedly issues arrest warrants against 33 officials , including former un investigator detlev mehlis , involved in the international probe into the assassination of lebanese ex-premier rafiq hariri . the potential for an escalation in tensions surrounding the un-backed investigation into the murder of rafiq hariri increased dramatically last week when a damascus court allegedly issued arrest warrants against individuals it claims misled the international tribunal .
it is claimed that the syrian court has ordered the arrest of 33 people including detlev mehlis , the german prosecutor who led the early stages of the un investigation , accusing a wide range of officials of giving false testimony to the un tribunal .
according to general jamil al-sayyed , the former head of lebanon 's security services who was imprisoned for over four years on suspicion of being involved in hariri 's killing , a senior judge in damascus has issued arrest warrants " against judges , security officers , politicians , journalists and other lebanese , arab and foreign officials and individuals " involved in the investigation into the 2005 assassination .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sayyed issued his complaint to the court in damascus along with mehlis , the officials targeted by the damascus court include ashraf rifi , lebanon 's chief of police , top prosecutor saeed mirza , former justice minister charles rizk and abdel halim khadda , syria 's exiled former vice president .
sayyed , who along with three other suspects in hariri 's murder was released last year due to lack of evidence , lodged a complaint with the damascus court claiming that the un 's special tribunal for lebanon -lrb- stl -rrb- was based on fabricated testimony aimed at implicating syria and its supporters in lebanon .
sayyed claims that lebanese officials had refused to consider his complaint and that the un had also rejected his accusations , leading to him submitting his case to the court in damascus .
german prosecutor rejects claims the investigation led by mehlis , the commissioner of the un international independent investigation commission -lrb- uniiic -rrb- between 2005 and 2006 and author of two reports that implicated lebanese and syrian military intelligence in the assassination , has regularly been cited by syria and the shiite militant group hezbollah in their attempts to discredit the entire process .
the arrest warrant suggests that as tensions around the probe increase so will the campaign against mehlis and his work on the case .
mehlis rejected the claims that an arrest warrant had been issued against him and told deutsche welle that he was unaware of what basis any such warrant would have .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehlis and his investigation have been attacked by critics " i do not have the slightest idea what basis , if any , syria has for issuing an arrest warrant and i have not received any official notification from anyone , including the un and my own government on the actual existence of a syrian arrest warrant against me , " he said .
" if indeed an arrest warrant exists among others against the former lebanese justice minister , the chief of police the general prosecutor and above all witnesses in the assassination case , i would consider this as interference in the ongoing investigation . "
when asked if the arrest warrants added weight to the belief that damascus was somehow involved in hariri 's death and that syria was trying to further discredit the investigation , mehlis said : " you certainly have to wonder for what reason a country is so determined to get rid of an independent judicial process . "
heiko wimmen , a middle east expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , questioned the legitimacy of the warrants and the sources behind the evidence supporting them . " it is next to impossible to judge whether or not there is reliable factual evidence , " he told deutsche welle .
" the fact is that , during the early phase , the statements of witnesses with doubtful credentials were given more credit than they seemed to deserve .
with hindsight , it appears difficult to avoid the conclusion that during that phase , the investigation was determined to indict the syrian regime or a certain faction within it , and was therefore ready to accept evidence at face value that should have been probed more thoroughly . " " the syrians and their lebanese allies claim that this was not merely a result of negligence or bias on the side of the tribunal , but that these ' false witnesses ' were in fact ' fabricated ' by people close to hariri - the group against which the syrians now issued the warrants .
at least one of the ' false witnesses ' defected to syria in late 2005 , retracted his statements , and claimed that he was threatened and bribed into making them , so it is possible that the syrian warrants are based on these statements . "
arrest warrants part of a wider plan of disruption " the arrest warrants are part of a concerted effort to undermine confidence and faith in the stl , " nadim shehadi , a middle east expert at the royal institute of international affairs , chatham house , told deutsche welle .
" it is succeeding to a certain extent because it is diverting attention to side issues . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beirut was paralyzed by strikes , riots and bombings in 2007 " the question is not really about the warrants but about the stl which is an instrument of international protection over lebanon .
when it was set up , the country was under siege with parliament paralysed , the town center was occupied by the opposition , assassinations were regularly occurring , terror attacks and threats were ongoing .
the failure of the stl would be the failure of this protection . it is the un that is on trial as much as the perpetrators of the crimes in lebanon - it is a test of whether international legality exists and can provide such protection . " " making this move now is obviously part of a larger campaign , waged by hezbollah and syria , to discredit the tribunal and ultimately , to scrap it altogether , ahead of the expected indictments , which according to unofficial information will implicate members of hezbollah , " said heiko wimmen .
" it is a message to hariri that all his attempts to reconcile with damascus will not do as long as he refuses to disown the tribunal . " the stl has been investigating claims that hezbollah , with support from syria , was behind the car bomb that killed hariri in beirut five years ago .
both the shiite group and the government in damascus have consistently denied the accusations .
syria pulled its troops out of lebanon after a 29-year presence in response to the claims and bilateral ties between the two nations soured considerably as a result . syria-lebanon relations likely to suffer further relations between lebanon and syria had been slowly normalizing since rafiq hariri 's death , as indicated by syrian president basher al-assad 's visit to lebanon in august and lebanese prime minister saad hariri 's efforts to improve the relationship between the two countries over the past year , even going as far as saying that he had been wrong to implicate syria in the death of his father .
however further tensions seem likely as a result of this week 's visit to beirut by iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad who is seen as a staunch supporter of hezbollah . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between saad hariri and assad 's syria may unravel the visit and news of the arrest warrants are likely to strike a new blow to relations between damascus and beirut which are once again becoming strained over reports that the stl is ready to indict members of hezbollah in connection with hariri 's murder . just as significantly , it could also alter the course of the stl 's investigation and any subsequent prosecutions . " syria did not issue these arrest warrants , " said nadim shehadi .
" the announcement was made by the press office of general jamil sayyid .
an official syrian statement dismissing the importance of the warrants came a couple of days later . " " however , what is relevant in this affair is that it is an emphatic ' no ' from damascus to saad hariri 's offer of a compromise with both hezbollah and syria .
the compromise involves putting everything related to the assassinations in a box called ' the tribunal ' and carrying on with normal relations . " " also if there is any indictment of hezbollah members or syrians , hariri explicitly said that they would then be considered as rogue elements and not taken to implicate any others . the offer thus uses the stl as an instrument of stability rather than that of instability . the fact that the arrest warrants include most of saad hariri 's entourage and advisors means that the syrians will accept nothing less than abolition of the stl .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 13.10.2010 nato includes threat of cyber attack in new strategic concept document großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyber attacks on defense systems are a concern for nato nato plans to reform its mutual protection policy to include the increasing threat of cyber attack .
but while protecting member nations from computer viruses is a huge task in itself , it is far from the only challenge . nato foreign and defense ministers will convene for a series of informal meetings in brussels on thursday to discuss the alliance 's new strategic concept , missile defense and reform ahead of its november summit in lisbon . the new strategy paper , presented in draft form by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen on tuesday , addresses issues such as the creation of a european missile defense shield , the balancing of the alliance 's nuclear disarmament and deterrence goals , the reform of nato 's command structure and agencies , and the thorny topic of common defense spending . it also addresses the need for nato members to increase their awareness of and defense against the threat of cyber attack . the emergence of the stuxnet computer virus which some defense experts have already labelled the world 's " first cyber superweapon " has raised the very real prospect of cyber warfare making the leap from science fiction to security fact .
the mysterious electronic worm allegedly hit computerized industrial equipment in iran last month , causing the regime in tehran to claim it was part of a deliberate attack launched by one or more of its enemies against the islamic republic 's controversial nuclear program .
the implication from tehran was that the united states and / or israel were behind the launch of the virus .
stuxnet , which targets control systems made by german industrial giant siemens commonly used in utility and energy systems , has since been reported in china where millions of computers around the country have become infected .
stuxnet 's potentially global campaign once again highlights the vulnerability of computer systems and the potential financial and structural chaos a targeted virus can wreak .
in what was thought to be the first large-scale cyber attack on a sovereign state , estonia was hit with a denial-of-service attack in 2007 whereby networks were flooded with useless information which eventually shut down government services and banks .
while the attack came during a dispute with russia over the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , causing suspicion to fall on moscow , the source of the virus was never discovered or proven .
the attack was believed to have cost the baltic state between 19 million and 28 million euros -lrb- $ 26m- $ 38m -rrb- .
while the havoc created by the collapse of public and governmental infrastructure is worrying in itself , the application of viruses created to attack military systems is causing more concern .
nato concerned by growing military applications of viruses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : targeting energy and utility systems would cause chaos the threat of system-targeted viruses as a new weapon of war is being taken so seriously by nato that it is considering adding cyber warfare to article 5 of its charter which covers mutual protection of its members .
should nato agree to the inclusion of cyber attack in the article , the bloc would be honor-bound to respond to a cyber assault on any of its members - just as it would if a nato nation was being conventionally attacked .
nato , which experienced minor attacks by serbian hackers during the kosovo war in 1999 , intends to discuss the increasing threat of cyber warfare at its summit in lisbon next month .
" nato will face a lot of problems if cyber attacks are inserted into article 5 , " alex neil , an expert at the royal united services institute , a london-based security think-tank , told deutsche welle . " in terms of response , what we could see is a cooperative effort between members which have a cyber capability ; some of which are more developed than others . " " there has been a concerted effort by some nations to pursue covert offensive cyber capabilities and these could be harnessed by nato as part of a joint response , although some nations may not want to show the level of their own capability , even to their allies . " protecting alliance members fraught with difficulties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's doctrine of mutual protection may be updated while developing a new cyber strategy may make sense as the potential for attacks on defense systems grows , nato faces significant implementation challenges if it decides to include cyber protection under article 5 , according to derek reveron , a cyber warfare expert at the us naval war college in rhode island . " it 's unclear how nato might respond in a proportionate way , " reveron told deutsche welle .
" most cyber attacks result in data theft or data loss .
while dollar values are placed on data , there is clearly an important difference to an attack that produces human casualties or physical destruction . " " also , the potential for fratricide is great , " he added .
" if nato or an adversarial entity such as a country or a non-state actor launched a cyber attack , their own networks are vulnerable .
worms and viruses exploit vulnerabilities in commercially available software like microsoft windows .
as the stuxnet worm illustrates , infections can not be contained . " identifying source of cyber attacks almost impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accurately identifying the source of attacks is difficult as the small number of publically recognized attacks has shown , identifying the source of the virus is currently almost impossible - which is both a huge advantage to the attacker and a massive disadvantage to those looking to retaliate .
identifying a cyber enemy is as much a problem as the damage one can cause . " retaliation would be problematic because defining the source of the threat or attack is very difficult , " alex neil said . " you may be able to target a particular server but there are so many levels of deniability involved and often attacks come through proxy countries or through third parties . citing article 5 could only really be applied if the cyber attack comes as part of a broader , conventional attack . " " in the cyber world , individual hackers tend to pose the greatest danger to cyber security , but governments now include cyber war in their planning and operations .
but unlike a conventional attack , there are no national markings on a computer worm , " derek reveron said " many countries , including israel , russia , china , and the united states , have dedicated cyber programs within their defense establishments .
largely focused on defending their own networks , these organizations are developing offensive capabilities .
the greatest cyber capabilities lie in non-state actors and corporations though . " cyber attacks to be the opening salvos of future conflicts ? s ecurity experts are predicting that while cyber attacks alone could cause systems to be severely compromised and disabled , the development of cyber warfare could lead to stuxnet-type worms being released as the opening salvo in a conventional attack ahead of a traditional bombing campaign or land invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian computer viruses led the way before tanks in georgia " the most recent example of this was the cyber attack that accompanied russia 's invasion of georgia in 2008 , " reveron said .
" as russian tanks and aircraft were entering georgian territory , cyber warriors attacked the georgian ministry of defense .
though it had a minimal effect , the attack was a harbinger ; future conflicts will have both a physical dimension and a virtual dimension . " " in the worst scenario , a cyber attack would target industrial systems and attempt to control or destroy physical infrastructure .
in the most likely scenario , cyber capabilities would be used to disrupt command and control of military forces and discredit governments through media manipulation . " however , alex neil does not believe that all-out cyber war is imminent . " the threat is a salient one but cyber warfare is not currently at the forefront of active operations , " neil said .
" what we ’ re dealing with at the moment is cyber espionage and sabotage rather than warfare , which suggests all-out conflict . " author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a meeting with thaci in the capital city of pristina , clinton said the dialogue should begin as soon as possible . " ... even though there will be elections here and then in the following years elections in serbia , we believe that it is in kosovo 's interest for this dialogue to begin and to conclude in as expeditious a manner as possible , " clinton said .
clinton said the united states would take on a support role in the talks , which are to be brokered by the eu .
washington has been a strong supporter of kosovo , one of about 70 nations that recognizes kosovo as independent . common interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia vows it will never recognise the independence of kosovo the us secretary of state emphasized that the talks must not be allowed to drag on .

the two nations had agreed in september to move ahead with talks about shared practical concerns such as transport and telecommunications , as well as more sensitive issues like the return of refugees , the status of serbian orthodox monasteries and the majority serbs living in northern kosovo .
but just weeks after the agreement , the sudden resignation of president fatmir sejdiu ignited fears that the internal political crisis could stall the talks .
a step forward following his meeting with clinton , thaci said that pristina was ready to move past the rift with belgrade .

the letter was posted on several chinese and english websites on wednesday .
it was later deleted from chatrooms on major portals , possibly by government censors , though it continued to crop up in more obscure chat rooms .
mao 's former secretary among the signatories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's former secretary li rui is among the signatories the letter lists the names of 23 signatories , among them li rui , a former secretary to mao zedong , hu jiwei , the retired editor-in-chief of the communist party newspaper people 's daily , and jiang ping , the retired head of the china university of political science and law .
several other signatories are known for their reformist sympathies .
the main thrust of the bluntly worded letter is that the government should implement article 35 of the chinese constitution approved in 1982 , which allows chinese citizens " freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession and of demonstration " .
the " former avowal and concrete denial " of this right is described as " false democracy " in the letter .
the signatories call upon the government to give editors and journalists the freedom to report without restrictions and to end the system of censors previewing media and book content .
worried about the premier 's rights the letter cites recent examples of censorship , going so far as to state : " even the premier of our country does not have the freedom of speech or of press " .
apparently , the official xinhua news agency did not report comments by premier wen jiabao on political reform made in an important speech last august in the southern city of shenzhen .
as regards the communist party , the letter says that if the party does not reform itself , it will lose its vitality and die a natural death .
chinese citizens have the right to know the errors of the ruling party , the letter says .

the iranian govermnent said they were trying to interview the son of a woman sentenced to death by stoning . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said wednesday that he was doing all he could to secure the release of two journalists arrested in iran for interviewing " counter-revolutionaries " whilst on tourist visas .
" we are working with urgency to resolve this case , " westerwelle said .
he confirmed that the arrested men were german citizens , and that germany was still trying to contact them .
iran 's judiciary said on monday that the two were detained after interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , the iranian woman whose stoning sentence was shelved last month following a global outcry .
working for release westerwelle has appealed to his iranian counterpart , manuscher mottaki , to personally take up the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has asked his iranian counterpart to intervene " we are working on all diplomatic levels and using all diplomatic channels to pursue the freeing of these two germans and returning them to germany as soon as possible , " westerwelle said .
the two detainees have not been named and it is not clear who they were working for .
initial reports suggested they may have been working for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper .
hendrik zoerner , the spokesperson of the german journalists trade union , djv , said he contacted the newspaper for more information after the arrests were made public .
" at that time , their public stance was that they could not confirm or deny the reports .
and so we still do n't know who it was or who they were working for , " zoerner said .
some sources say the pair were a reporter and a photographer .
risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders calls iran 's media censorship ' disturbing ' the iranian government has accused the men of breaking iranian law by doing research without official accreditation . iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast also said the two germans were working with anti-revolutionary networks abroad .
" an anti-revolutionary group based in germany made the preparations for these two people to refer to ms mohammadi 's son , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast told a weekly news conference on tuesday .
doing journalistic research in iran on a tourist visa is very dangerous , says , zoerner . " iran is not a free country and has been trying for years to hinder journalists who are practicing their profession . if you 're caught doing research there as a tourist , you 're taking a huge risk , " zoerner said .

meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

first , he had his spectacles stolen at a launch party in london for his new novel " freedom . "
then it transpired that the wrong draft of the book had been published in britain and an entire print run of 80,000 copies had to be pulped . but the rapturous reception he was given at the frankfurt book fair last week no doubt provided some comfort .
" he was surrounded by an entourage of admirers wherever he went , " said german author and illustrator nadia budde , who was there to pick up a german youth literature award . the media circus has continued to dog him on his current reading tour .
the interest he 's generating is no surprise given how well " freedom , " which took him nine years to complete , is doing in germany .
when it was published in translation last month , it shot straight into the top five on the spiegel bestseller list and his readings this week are all sold out . dead or - very much - alive ? not least because franzen spent time in berlin as a fulbright scholar , germany has always had a very soft spot for him .
but not only him - a visit to any german bookstore provides ample evidence that readers in the land of " poets and thinkers " ca n't seem to get enough of american fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the novel dead ?
" people here take literature very seriously , " franzen told journalists in frankfurt over the weekend . but why specifically american literature , especially when many believe it 's seen better days ?
us critic lee siegel triggered a storm of controversy this summer when he pronounced the american novel dead in an article for the new york observer . " fiction has become culturally irrelevant , " he railed .
" for about a million reasons , fiction has now become a museum-piece genre , most of whose practitioners are more like cripplingly self-conscious curators or theoreticians than writers . " german readers beg to differ .
" contemporary us literature is just more diverse and original than its german equivalent , " observed heinz ickstadt from the john f. kennedy institute for north american studies in berlin . the rock-n-roll factor a big fan of american writers , nadia budde feels that they have a lightness of touch that their german counterparts lack - and that in comparison , german fiction is indeed a " museum-piece genre . " " you can always see how carefully -lsb- german -rsb- novels have been constructed , polished and controlled , " she said , pointing to writers such as daniel kehlmann , " whereas there 's something very rock and roll about novels by us writers like franzen , jeffrey eugenides , michael chabon and david foster wallace .
they have something unbridled about them , something very free and easy , effortless , cool and crazy - something that germans long to have but just do n't . " like many of his contemporaries , franzen certainly writes with a visceral edge .
" my idea of a novel is something that has an emotional impact , so what i do is to go to the places where we feel the strongest emotions , " said franzen .
" -lsb- as a writer -rsb- you try and get energy going in a book , and you reach for the content that has its own intrinsic energy .
what you want is to make the pages come alive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us authors are edgier than their german counterparts he and his peers can make german writing look very heavy-handed - especially when it 's aiming for humor .
" as close as it is to reality , us literature is not as naked and stark - reading contemporary german writing can sometimes feel like having things pointed out to you under a neon light , " said budde . love-hate relationship with the us what also makes germany such an enthusiastic market for us writers is the innate familiarity to germans of today 's america .
even though the trans-atlantic relationship suffered during the bush administration , to germany the us still represents the new world .
over the years , it 's lost none of its sheen . " despite all the criticism that exists against the us , it 's still the land of opportunity to us , " said budde , " not just in terms of money and success , but also as a country that 's home to an incredible mix of nationalities . "
historically , of course , it 's also a country where immigrants could reinvent themselves and shrug off their past . so while us writers like franzen and john irving are happy to wear influences such as stendhal , dickens and tolstoy on their sleeves , they also manage to create what franzen calls " enveloping narratives " that take on their own momentum . in contrast , " contemporary german writers just seem so very weighed down by european history and literary classics , " observed budde . but ultimately , the dominance of us fiction in the german book market could also have more prosaic reasons .
in literature as in cinema , it 's america that calls the shots in germany . " it has a lot to do with the structure of book markets , " said heinz ickstadt .
" big names inevitably work their magic , and the german book market does n't want to be seen to be limping behind when it comes to getting out the latest thomas pynchon or richard powers .
potential bestsellers are always going to be a temptation . " author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many believe the hooligans to be part of an organized movement to ruin serbia 's reputation in europe . serbian officials expressed fear of a right-wing extremist plot against their country 's entry to the european union , after serbian soccer hooligans clashed with italian police tuesday evening at the two countries ' euro 2012 qualifying game .
" obviously somebody wants to demonstrate that serbia is neither ready , nor mature enough to go to europe , " justice ministry state secretary , slobodan homen , said wednesday in an interview with tv b92 .
at least sixteen people were hospitalized and 17 serb fans arrested in the northern italian city of genoa after violent riots caused a 40-minute delay to the match and then forced the game to be abandoned six minutes in .
part of a bigger plot the president of the serbian football organization fss , tomislav karadzic , said the riots were organized in belgrade , well ahead of the match .
" we have had hints that this would happen .
these kids are just the executors , those who ordered this are in belgrade , " he told serbian reporters after the game was abandoned , adding , " the state must react . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent right-extremist turned belgrade 's pride parade into a battleground the serb hooligans are believed by many to be part of an organized , ultra-nationalist movement to damage serbia 's chances at eu accession , according to german press agency dpa 's belgrade correspondent boris babic , who told deutsche welle that serbia fears further damage to its reputation .
babic said the soccer hooligans were part of the same movement that rioted in protest at belgrade 's pride parade , adding that there was a " group of maybe 500 individuals who are at the core of every violent event in the country since the 1990s . "
he believes the hooligans to be mafia pawns , rather than true sports fans .
" these criminal organizations have used football for drug smuggling , for an exercise of political influence and whatever can be drawn from their position of power .
they mostly get away without being sentenced to prison , " he said .
hooligans threw flares at the players two police officers and 14 fans were injured in clashes after the game .
police seized clubs and knives from serb hooligans , who also hurled flares onto the pitch .
italian authorities claim they were not warned by serbia as to the danger posed by the hooligans , who arrived with banners proclaiming " kosovo is ours . "
newspaper reports have disputed the authorities ' claim .
originally , the hooligans had refused to sit in their designated area and had to be herded in by police .
" in the process , they were pushed in without any of them being checked or frisked , " according to world soccer 's rome correspondent , paddy agnew .
bildunterschrift : the hooligans brought in objects ranging from garden shears to firecrackers " these guys got in with all kinds of petards , smoke bombs , metal objects , garden sheers , " he told deutsche welle , adding , " obviously the italian authorities will have to explain how that happened . "
also arrested was an italian fan who attacked serb supporters with a crowbar .
the italian team were wearing black armbands to show solidarity with the families of four italian soldiers killed in afghanistan last week .
before the game , the serbs ’ first choice goalkeeper vladimir stojkovic was attacked by the fans , who threw a flare onto the team bus .
although stojkovic was not seriously injured , he refused to play out of fear , choosing to remain in the dressing room .
serb players may have encouraged hooligans incitement came from within the serb soccer team , according to agnew .
" the footballers made this three-finger signal which means ‘ greater serbia . '
they made that to their own fans , " he told deutsche welle .
italian coach cesare prandelli defended the serb players .
" we asked our opponents to go to their fans to try to calm them down … i do n't know what signs they made but they were clearly afraid , " the trainer said .
' 20 years of neglect ' meanwhile , former yugoslavia international player savo milosevic told belgrade 's b92 television that the violence in genoa was the result of 20 years of government neglect .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prandelli defended the serb players , saying they were visibly afraid " the government has been completely disinterested in sport and its problems over the last 20 years , hence serbia is now paying a heavy price for the failure to tackle hooliganism swiftly and decisively , " he said .
tuesday 's rioting is certainly not the first incident of violence by serb hooligans .
in 2008 , after kosovo declared independence from serbia , a chanting crowd of young men left stadium stands to torch the us embassy in belgrade and ransack several others .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

following a meeting with thaci in the capital city of pristina , clinton said the dialogue should begin as soon as possible . " ... even though there will be elections here and then in the following years elections in serbia , we believe that it is in kosovo 's interest for this dialogue to begin and to conclude in as expeditious a manner as possible , " clinton said .

now the eu is pressing for a 2014 end to the subsidies , angering some . in a bid to secure a 2007 law protecting coal mining subsidies during a phasing-out of domestic production through 2018 , union leaders this week called for top-level talks between the german government and mining company rag .
the law may be threatened by the european commission 's push for subsidies to non-competitive hard coal mines throughout the eu to be cut by october 2014 .
the move could greatly affect the german states of north rhine-westphalia and saarland , where five mines employ more than 20,000 miners .
when the agreement to cut subsidies by 2018 was signed into law in 2007 , a clause was included that conditions would be reviewed in 2012 .
at the time , a deutsche welle article mentioned some 34,000 miners working in 8 mines throughout germany .
coal regions could become blighted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loss of subsidies could devastate employment in some regions christoph meer , a spokesman for the mining , chemical and energy industrial union , said the 2007 agreement was a compromise based in part on a promise that domestic coal mining subsidies would be ended gradually and without the blight of layoffs .
speeding up the process would lead to " significant increases in unemployment in coal mining regions , " he said .
" the cost of speeding this up would be massive , " he told deutsche welle .
" if this suggestion of the eu commission were to be carried it out , it would lead to massive layoffs , and the social model would collapse . "
he added that germany 's coal power plants would continue to be stoked with imported coal for years to come , negating any reductions in greenhouse gas emissions .
" what we expect now is for the federal government to energetically advocate for germany 's interests with one voice in brussels , " he said .

first , he had his spectacles stolen at a launch party in london for his new novel " freedom . "
then it transpired that the wrong draft of the book had been published in britain and an entire print run of 80,000 copies had to be pulped . but the rapturous reception he was given at the frankfurt book fair last week no doubt provided some comfort .
" he was surrounded by an entourage of admirers wherever he went , " said german author and illustrator nadia budde , who was there to pick up a german youth literature award . the media circus has continued to dog him on his current reading tour .
the interest he 's generating is no surprise given how well " freedom , " which took him nine years to complete , is doing in germany .
when it was published in translation last month , it shot straight into the top five on the spiegel bestseller list and his readings this week are all sold out . dead or - very much - alive ? not least because franzen spent time in berlin as a fulbright scholar , germany has always had a very soft spot for him .
but not only him - a visit to any german bookstore provides ample evidence that readers in the land of " poets and thinkers " ca n't seem to get enough of american fiction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the novel dead ?
" people here take literature very seriously , " franzen told journalists in frankfurt over the weekend . but why specifically american literature , especially when many believe it 's seen better days ?
us critic lee siegel triggered a storm of controversy this summer when he pronounced the american novel dead in an article for the new york observer . " fiction has become culturally irrelevant , " he railed .
" for about a million reasons , fiction has now become a museum-piece genre , most of whose practitioners are more like cripplingly self-conscious curators or theoreticians than writers . " german readers beg to differ .
" contemporary us literature is just more diverse and original than its german equivalent , " observed heinz ickstadt from the john f. kennedy institute for north american studies in berlin . the rock-n-roll factor a big fan of american writers , nadia budde feels that they have a lightness of touch that their german counterparts lack - and that in comparison , german fiction is indeed a " museum-piece genre . " " you can always see how carefully -lsb- german -rsb- novels have been constructed , polished and controlled , " she said , pointing to writers such as daniel kehlmann , " whereas there 's something very rock and roll about novels by us writers like franzen , jeffrey eugenides , michael chabon and david foster wallace .
they have something unbridled about them , something very free and easy , effortless , cool and crazy - something that germans long to have but just do n't . " like many of his contemporaries , franzen certainly writes with a visceral edge .
" my idea of a novel is something that has an emotional impact , so what i do is to go to the places where we feel the strongest emotions , " said franzen .
" -lsb- as a writer -rsb- you try and get energy going in a book , and you reach for the content that has its own intrinsic energy .
what you want is to make the pages come alive . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us authors are edgier than their german counterparts he and his peers can make german writing look very heavy-handed - especially when it 's aiming for humor .
" as close as it is to reality , us literature is not as naked and stark - reading contemporary german writing can sometimes feel like having things pointed out to you under a neon light , " said budde . love-hate relationship with the us what also makes germany such an enthusiastic market for us writers is the innate familiarity to germans of today 's america .
even though the trans-atlantic relationship suffered during the bush administration , to germany the us still represents the new world .
over the years , it 's lost none of its sheen . " despite all the criticism that exists against the us , it 's still the land of opportunity to us , " said budde , " not just in terms of money and success , but also as a country that 's home to an incredible mix of nationalities . "
historically , of course , it 's also a country where immigrants could reinvent themselves and shrug off their past . so while us writers like franzen and john irving are happy to wear influences such as stendhal , dickens and tolstoy on their sleeves , they also manage to create what franzen calls " enveloping narratives " that take on their own momentum . in contrast , " contemporary german writers just seem so very weighed down by european history and literary classics , " observed budde . but ultimately , the dominance of us fiction in the german book market could also have more prosaic reasons .
in literature as in cinema , it 's america that calls the shots in germany . " it has a lot to do with the structure of book markets , " said heinz ickstadt .
" big names inevitably work their magic , and the german book market does n't want to be seen to be limping behind when it comes to getting out the latest thomas pynchon or richard powers .
potential bestsellers are always going to be a temptation . " author : jane paulick editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at least sixteen people were hospitalized and 17 serb fans arrested in the northern italian city of genoa after violent riots caused a 40-minute delay to the match and then forced the game to be abandoned six minutes in .
part of a bigger plot the president of the serbian football organization fss , tomislav karadzic , said the riots were organized in belgrade , well ahead of the match .

babic said the soccer hooligans were part of the same movement that rioted in protest at belgrade 's pride parade , adding that there was a " group of maybe 500 individuals who are at the core of every violent event in the country since the 1990s . "
he believes the hooligans to be mafia pawns , rather than true sports fans .

but some internet experts liken the concept to outsourcing police work . the united kingdom is notorious for its widespread use of cctv surveillance cameras .
now , a new internet startup is adding a twist to the privacy debate by bringing live streams of footage to viewers online .
devon-based " internet eyes " hopes to profit by rewarding internet users who spot and report shoplifters .
the rewards can be as much as 1,000 british pounds -lrb- 1,144 euros -rrb- , and internet privacy and civil liberties advocates describe the system as a privatization of law enforcement .
internet eyes went online on october 4 , and its founder , tony morgan , said the site has garnered more than 1,000 viewers who have reported more than 135 possible incidents .
the site prevents voyeurism by anonymizing feeds , which are switched every 20 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk has a long history of monitoring the public with cctv cameras " you ca n't use internet eyes for voyeuristic pleasures , " morgan told deutsche welle .
" we 've made sure that there 's no way this can be done .
with internet eyes you do n't know where you 're watching . "
service fee for businesses when a user reports suspicious activity , a text message is sent to two mobile phone numbers selected by the store owner .
it is then followed by a picture message of what was on the camera at the time .
immediately after reporting activity , users are transferred to a new feed so they ca n't see what transpires in the store .
internet eyes plans to make its money by charging a 75 pound monthly fee to storeowners who subscribe to the service , making it significantly less expensive than hiring a security guard .
the company is providing its service free of charge for three months in the uk in the hopes winning over customers .
" it 's very , very inexpensive , " morgan said .
" if a retailer does n't lose more than that -lrb- to shoplifting -rrb- during the course of a month , then he does n't need our service .
but that 's highly unlikely . "
morgan says the uk 's information commissioner 's office withdrew its initial objections to the service after internet eyes agreed to charge users a nominal fee to prevent abuse and limit itself to the european union .
likely to struggle on the european level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say cctv cameras are ineffective and intrusive but viktor mayer-schoenberger of the oxford internet institute says he believes internet eyes will run into trouble when it butts against the european union 's data protection directive .
" keep in mind that there is a huge risk , given the fact that no data protection commissioner has ruled on this as far as i can tell , " he told deutsche welle .
" they spoke with information commissioner 's office , but that does n't mean anything . "
the eu data protection directive creates a " minimum standard " for countries to meet , meaning what is legal in the uk might not be legal elsewhere , according to mayer-schoenberger .
" it 's an obvious solution given the power of crowdsourcing and internet economics – namely the fact that there are so many eyeballs out there on the net that can be brought to good use , " he said .
could foster bias and suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been abuses of over aggressive surveillance in the german corporate environment but regardless of internet eyes ' legal status , mayer-schoenberger objects to the service because of the social precedent it sets .
he sees it as the outsourcing of a law enforcement function to amateur private citizens , who have a higher likelihood of biases such as racial profiling .
" just pressing the button actually causes this scene to be investigated further , " he said " that 's pretty powerful , i 'd say .
that means i can direct the attention of law enforcement to something i find suspicious .
that 's a pretty powerful position . ”
mayer-schoenberger also said internet eyes ' built-in reward structure caters to suspicion and a host of other societal problems .
" from a business sense it makes perfect sense , " he said .
" from a legal perspective , whether or not its legal depends on complicated issues .
from a societal perspective , i 'd be extremely cautious . "
experts say cctv ineffective according to ross anderson , a professor of security engineering at the university of cambridge , cctv has been shown in research to be ineffective .
he described himself as being " shocked but not surprised " by the launch of internet eyes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of internet eyes says he 's helping small shopkeepers " it works in car parks , but almost nowhere else , " he wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" so in the long run , i expect this business to fail .
in the short run , it 's a symptom of the way in which many englishmen were persuaded to abandon their liberties one by one under both thatcher and blair .
so we might be thankful that policy in europe is also made by countries like germany , poland and lithuania , with more recent memories of oppression than we have . "
anderson pointed out that the united kingdom is currently being taken to court by the european commission for failing to effectively implement the data protection directive .
protects independent businesses but morgan argues his company 's service helps small , independent retailers , many of whom ca n't afford to hire security guards and are struggling to maintain their place in the commercial landscape .
" is n't it time we started to look after the independent retail chap instead of looking after the people that rob him ? " he said .
" we do so much to protect those that do the stealing , yet nothing for the poor chap who is trying to make a living . "

the new rules are part of president nicolas sarkozy 's law and order crackdown .
the bill calls for any foreign-born citizens naturalized for less than 10 years to be stripped of their citizenship if convicted of violent crimes against police officers or other public officials .
this punishment currently applies only to terrorism charges .
the new measures would also allow the police to deport foreign nationals , including those from other eu countries , for repeated acts of theft , aggressive begging , or for illegally occupying land - a move that appears to target foreign-born roma gypsies living in france .
in addition , the new law will make it easier to expel any foreigner who is considered a burden on france 's social welfare system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : besson wants ' good french citizens ' sarkozy 's government drew condemnation from eu officials in recent months for rounding up hundreds of roma from illegal camps and deporting them to romania and bulgaria .
immigration minister eric besson , who proposed the new rules , said he wanted a “ mechanism for producing good french citizens . ”
he hailed the measures , which passed comfortably in the first reading , 294-239 , calling the vote “ a big first step in the building of a european immigration policy . ”
critics , however , claim that the plan will make second-class citizens of immigrants who obtain french nationality .
the draft legislation still has to be put before the senate .

meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 13.10.2010 uk startup ' internet eyes ' crowdsources retail surveillance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk is notorious for its use of cctv cameras for a small monthly fee , uk shop owners can have their surveillance cameras watched by internet users eager to catch shoplifters for a cash reward .
but some internet experts liken the concept to outsourcing police work . the united kingdom is notorious for its widespread use of cctv surveillance cameras .
now , a new internet startup is adding a twist to the privacy debate by bringing live streams of footage to viewers online .
devon-based " internet eyes " hopes to profit by rewarding internet users who spot and report shoplifters .
the rewards can be as much as 1,000 british pounds -lrb- 1,144 euros -rrb- , and internet privacy and civil liberties advocates describe the system as a privatization of law enforcement .
internet eyes went online on october 4 , and its founder , tony morgan , said the site has garnered more than 1,000 viewers who have reported more than 135 possible incidents .
the site prevents voyeurism by anonymizing feeds , which are switched every 20 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk has a long history of monitoring the public with cctv cameras " you ca n't use internet eyes for voyeuristic pleasures , " morgan told deutsche welle .
" we 've made sure that there 's no way this can be done .
with internet eyes you do n't know where you 're watching . "
service fee for businesses when a user reports suspicious activity , a text message is sent to two mobile phone numbers selected by the store owner .
it is then followed by a picture message of what was on the camera at the time .
immediately after reporting activity , users are transferred to a new feed so they ca n't see what transpires in the store .
internet eyes plans to make its money by charging a 75 pound monthly fee to storeowners who subscribe to the service , making it significantly less expensive than hiring a security guard .
the company is providing its service free of charge for three months in the uk in the hopes winning over customers .
" it 's very , very inexpensive , " morgan said .
" if a retailer does n't lose more than that -lrb- to shoplifting -rrb- during the course of a month , then he does n't need our service .
but that 's highly unlikely . "
morgan says the uk 's information commissioner 's office withdrew its initial objections to the service after internet eyes agreed to charge users a nominal fee to prevent abuse and limit itself to the european union .
likely to struggle on the european level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say cctv cameras are ineffective and intrusive but viktor mayer-schoenberger of the oxford internet institute says he believes internet eyes will run into trouble when it butts against the european union 's data protection directive .
" keep in mind that there is a huge risk , given the fact that no data protection commissioner has ruled on this as far as i can tell , " he told deutsche welle .
" they spoke with information commissioner 's office , but that does n't mean anything . "
the eu data protection directive creates a " minimum standard " for countries to meet , meaning what is legal in the uk might not be legal elsewhere , according to mayer-schoenberger .
" it 's an obvious solution given the power of crowdsourcing and internet economics – namely the fact that there are so many eyeballs out there on the net that can be brought to good use , " he said .
could foster bias and suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been abuses of over aggressive surveillance in the german corporate environment but regardless of internet eyes ' legal status , mayer-schoenberger objects to the service because of the social precedent it sets .
he sees it as the outsourcing of a law enforcement function to amateur private citizens , who have a higher likelihood of biases such as racial profiling .
" just pressing the button actually causes this scene to be investigated further , " he said " that 's pretty powerful , i 'd say .
that means i can direct the attention of law enforcement to something i find suspicious .
that 's a pretty powerful position . ”
mayer-schoenberger also said internet eyes ' built-in reward structure caters to suspicion and a host of other societal problems .
" from a business sense it makes perfect sense , " he said .
" from a legal perspective , whether or not its legal depends on complicated issues .
from a societal perspective , i 'd be extremely cautious . "
experts say cctv ineffective according to ross anderson , a professor of security engineering at the university of cambridge , cctv has been shown in research to be ineffective .
he described himself as being " shocked but not surprised " by the launch of internet eyes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of internet eyes says he 's helping small shopkeepers " it works in car parks , but almost nowhere else , " he wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" so in the long run , i expect this business to fail .
in the short run , it 's a symptom of the way in which many englishmen were persuaded to abandon their liberties one by one under both thatcher and blair .
so we might be thankful that policy in europe is also made by countries like germany , poland and lithuania , with more recent memories of oppression than we have . "
anderson pointed out that the united kingdom is currently being taken to court by the european commission for failing to effectively implement the data protection directive .
protects independent businesses but morgan argues his company 's service helps small , independent retailers , many of whom ca n't afford to hire security guards and are struggling to maintain their place in the commercial landscape .
" is n't it time we started to look after the independent retail chap instead of looking after the people that rob him ? " he said .
" we do so much to protect those that do the stealing , yet nothing for the poor chap who is trying to make a living . "

the iranian govermnent said they were trying to interview the son of a woman sentenced to death by stoning . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said wednesday that he was doing all he could to secure the release of two journalists arrested in iran for interviewing " counter-revolutionaries " whilst on tourist visas .
" we are working with urgency to resolve this case , " westerwelle said .
he confirmed that the arrested men were german citizens , and that germany was still trying to contact them .
iran 's judiciary said on monday that the two were detained after interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , the iranian woman whose stoning sentence was shelved last month following a global outcry .
working for release westerwelle has appealed to his iranian counterpart , manuscher mottaki , to personally take up the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has asked his iranian counterpart to intervene " we are working on all diplomatic levels and using all diplomatic channels to pursue the freeing of these two germans and returning them to germany as soon as possible , " westerwelle said .
the two detainees have not been named and it is not clear who they were working for .
initial reports suggested they may have been working for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper .
hendrik zoerner , the spokesperson of the german journalists trade union , djv , said he contacted the newspaper for more information after the arrests were made public .
" at that time , their public stance was that they could not confirm or deny the reports .
and so we still do n't know who it was or who they were working for , " zoerner said .
some sources say the pair were a reporter and a photographer .
risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders calls iran 's media censorship ' disturbing ' the iranian government has accused the men of breaking iranian law by doing research without official accreditation . iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast also said the two germans were working with anti-revolutionary networks abroad .
" an anti-revolutionary group based in germany made the preparations for these two people to refer to ms mohammadi 's son , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast told a weekly news conference on tuesday .
doing journalistic research in iran on a tourist visa is very dangerous , says , zoerner . " iran is not a free country and has been trying for years to hinder journalists who are practicing their profession . if you 're caught doing research there as a tourist , you 're taking a huge risk , " zoerner said .

the letter was posted on several chinese and english websites on wednesday .
it was later deleted from chatrooms on major portals , possibly by government censors , though it continued to crop up in more obscure chat rooms .
mao 's former secretary among the signatories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's former secretary li rui is among the signatories the letter lists the names of 23 signatories , among them li rui , a former secretary to mao zedong , hu jiwei , the retired editor-in-chief of the communist party newspaper people 's daily , and jiang ping , the retired head of the china university of political science and law .
several other signatories are known for their reformist sympathies .
the main thrust of the bluntly worded letter is that the government should implement article 35 of the chinese constitution approved in 1982 , which allows chinese citizens " freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession and of demonstration " .
the " former avowal and concrete denial " of this right is described as " false democracy " in the letter .
the signatories call upon the government to give editors and journalists the freedom to report without restrictions and to end the system of censors previewing media and book content .
worried about the premier 's rights the letter cites recent examples of censorship , going so far as to state : " even the premier of our country does not have the freedom of speech or of press " .
apparently , the official xinhua news agency did not report comments by premier wen jiabao on political reform made in an important speech last august in the southern city of shenzhen .
as regards the communist party , the letter says that if the party does not reform itself , it will lose its vitality and die a natural death .
chinese citizens have the right to know the errors of the ruling party , the letter says .

union members voted overwhelmingly on tuesday to extend their industrial action into wednesday and followed through with their threats to shut down some train services and stop fuel deliveries .
the sncf national rail company , which ran just one-in-three trains on tuesday , said service would likely be as badly disrupted on wednesday as the day before .
international train travel , however , was expected to return to normal with the eurostar service unaffected and many other trains running at almost normal levels to other destinations .

the iranian govermnent said they were trying to interview the son of a woman sentenced to death by stoning . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said wednesday that he was doing all he could to secure the release of two journalists arrested in iran for interviewing " counter-revolutionaries " whilst on tourist visas .
" we are working with urgency to resolve this case , " westerwelle said .
he confirmed that the arrested men were german citizens , and that germany was still trying to contact them .
iran 's judiciary said on monday that the two were detained after interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , the iranian woman whose stoning sentence was shelved last month following a global outcry .
working for release westerwelle has appealed to his iranian counterpart , manuscher mottaki , to personally take up the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has asked his iranian counterpart to intervene " we are working on all diplomatic levels and using all diplomatic channels to pursue the freeing of these two germans and returning them to germany as soon as possible , " westerwelle said .
the two detainees have not been named and it is not clear who they were working for .
initial reports suggested they may have been working for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper .
hendrik zoerner , the spokesperson of the german journalists trade union , djv , said he contacted the newspaper for more information after the arrests were made public .
" at that time , their public stance was that they could not confirm or deny the reports .
and so we still do n't know who it was or who they were working for , " zoerner said .
some sources say the pair were a reporter and a photographer .
risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders calls iran 's media censorship ' disturbing ' the iranian government has accused the men of breaking iranian law by doing research without official accreditation . iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast also said the two germans were working with anti-revolutionary networks abroad .
" an anti-revolutionary group based in germany made the preparations for these two people to refer to ms mohammadi 's son , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast told a weekly news conference on tuesday .
doing journalistic research in iran on a tourist visa is very dangerous , says , zoerner . " iran is not a free country and has been trying for years to hinder journalists who are practicing their profession . if you 're caught doing research there as a tourist , you 're taking a huge risk , " zoerner said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 13.10.2010 hochtief prepares defense against spanish takeover bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction giant hochtief employs 55,000 people spain 's acs construction has grown rapidly in recent years , and is seeking to expand further by acquiring germany 's hochtief .
meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

if the trials are successful , the eurostar monoply on the route could become a thing of the past . a train belonging to german rail operator deutsche bahn entered the channel tunnel that connects england with mainland europe for the first time on wednesday .
the ice3 train , built by the german company siemens , threatens to rival the monopoly held by the french-built eurostar train . since the trains still lack approval for the route between france and britain , they were pulled by a locomotive .
on board were staff from deutsche bahn and tunnel operator eurotunnel plus a technical team , but no passengers .
end of an era ?
the ice train was the first passenger train not operated by eurostar to use the tunnel , after eu rules required the tunnel be opened to competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurostar trains have had a monopoly on the tunnel france , which owns 55 percent of the cross-channel eurostar service , has reacted angrily to the company decision last week to buy trains worth about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 836 million -rrb- from siemens , rather than the french company alstom .
testing continues the train went only part of the way through the tunnel before returning to france .
a full trip to london is scheduled for next week .
deutsche bahn plans to offer passengers a high-speed connection with ice trains through the tunnel under the english channel by the end of 2013 .
about nine million passengers travel each year on the eurotstar train routes that connect brussels , london and paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 13.10.2010 marches in favor of stuttgart 21 rail project gain support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public support has been drowned out by the opposition opposition to the stuttgart 21 rail project has overtaken german media .
but while the supporters of the project may be in the minority , they 've also been holding protests which are growing in numbers . in the public debate over the controversial stuttgart 21 rail station renovation , a growing number of people are gathering to counter the massive opposition and show their support for the project .
christian list , organizer of the weekly pro-stuttgart 21 marches , said he thought the opposition had gotten out of hand .
" my beginning as a political activist was when i saw the people yelling and crying " liars ! " to the politicians in stuttgart , " he told deutsche welle .
" it all went a little bit too far .
so that was the moment when i said now is the point when i have to do something . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the supporters march to city hall every thursday growing in numbers every thursday , list gets together with a number of people and marches along a four-kilometer route to the city hall , where the crowd hears speeches to rally support .
he said the first march brought about 100 people , but that they have grown every week since , and that the most recent march drew 4,000 people .
that is still just a small fraction of the 60,000 to 100,000 people who showed up for the most recent protest against the project last saturday .
but list said the reasons why so many people have mobilized in opposition are not all based on fact .
" the politicians made big mistakes in the communication of this project , " he said .
" my opinion is that the people have too much information and they are overwhelmed by it .
so they just do n't know what is right and what is wrong . "
list said he supports the project because while it may be expensive , the economic benefits of connecting stuttgart to a broader high-speed rail network will eventually bring in even more money .
and although about 280 trees in the palace gardens have to be cut down , the project moves the train station underground , freeing up 100 hectares of land for public space where even more trees will be planted .
arbitration meetings there is little doubt that stuttgart 21 opponents have the loudest voice in the media .
their main complaints are that the renovation cost of 7 billion euros is far too high , and that the construction will damage the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler , left , said he is optimistic the arbitration will continue and they earned some vindication in their first meetings with state-appointed arbitrator heiner geissler on tuesday night , when geissler appeared to chastise state authorities for not being sufficiently transparent .
" all facts , all numbers , and all assessments have to be laid out on the table , " he told reporters .
" that 's the only way the lost trust and credibility can be won back .
and that 's an extremely important goal that we 're working toward in these talks . "
geissler added that he was optimistic that the discussions could continue and eventually reach a solution .
accusations of conflicting interests list runs his own communications firm , and he said working professionally in that field helped him in getting his message out .
but it has also led some people to claim he is not just a regular citizen voicing his opinion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : list said he hopes for a quick solution to the controversy " there are accusations that i work for -lrb- state rail company -rrb- deutsche bahn , or that i work for the city , that i 'm paid for doing this , " he said .
" and that 's not true .
my agency is working for different customers , but we do n't have deutsche bahn as a customer . "
despite his views on the project , list says his greatest hope is that the arbitration with opponents of stuttgart 21 will quickly lead to a resolution of the controversy .
" this divides the city right now , " he said .
" i have the hope that one day , very soon , this all calms down . "

following a meeting with thaci in the capital city of pristina , clinton said the dialogue should begin as soon as possible . " ... even though there will be elections here and then in the following years elections in serbia , we believe that it is in kosovo 's interest for this dialogue to begin and to conclude in as expeditious a manner as possible , " clinton said .

but just weeks after the agreement , the sudden resignation of president fatmir sejdiu ignited fears that the internal political crisis could stall the talks .
a step forward following his meeting with clinton , thaci said that pristina was ready to move past the rift with belgrade .
" time has come for finishing a century old conflict between kosovo and serbia .

the letter was posted on several chinese and english websites on wednesday .
it was later deleted from chatrooms on major portals , possibly by government censors , though it continued to crop up in more obscure chat rooms .
mao 's former secretary among the signatories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's former secretary li rui is among the signatories the letter lists the names of 23 signatories , among them li rui , a former secretary to mao zedong , hu jiwei , the retired editor-in-chief of the communist party newspaper people 's daily , and jiang ping , the retired head of the china university of political science and law .
several other signatories are known for their reformist sympathies .
the main thrust of the bluntly worded letter is that the government should implement article 35 of the chinese constitution approved in 1982 , which allows chinese citizens " freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession and of demonstration " .
the " former avowal and concrete denial " of this right is described as " false democracy " in the letter .
the signatories call upon the government to give editors and journalists the freedom to report without restrictions and to end the system of censors previewing media and book content .
worried about the premier 's rights the letter cites recent examples of censorship , going so far as to state : " even the premier of our country does not have the freedom of speech or of press " .
apparently , the official xinhua news agency did not report comments by premier wen jiabao on political reform made in an important speech last august in the southern city of shenzhen .
as regards the communist party , the letter says that if the party does not reform itself , it will lose its vitality and die a natural death .
chinese citizens have the right to know the errors of the ruling party , the letter says .

meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

"
the decision breaks with tradition and stunned the author himself . howard jacobson was " truly flabbergasted " to win this year 's man booker prize , the author told reporters after the presentation of the award tuesday evening in london 's guildhall . jacobson 's " the finkler question " is the first humorous novel to win the most esteemed literary award in the english-speaking world . previously longlisted twice for the prize , jacobson had grown accustomed to going away empty handed and was not considered a favorite for this year 's award .
nevertheless , he convinced three of the five judges , beating out favorite tom mccarthy and two-time winner peter carey . " they -lsb- the man booker judges -rsb- took me in their arms a little bit in the longlist - the shortlist felt like an embrace , " said jacobson , 68 .
" i never thought the affair was going to be consummated . " boosting readership british newspaper the guardian called this year 's choice " a victory for that most overlooked genre on literary prize lists , the comic novel , " while the independent said the jury 's decision " broke the mould . " " the finkler question , " as jacobson says , explores the jewish experience in britain .
the main character , a bbc radio producer , is not jewish himself , but becomes fascinated with jewishness through two close friends . the man booker prize is endowed with 50,000 pounds -lrb- $ 80,000 -rrb- , but jacobson said he 's more interested in winning readers than making money . " at my age it 's less about how much comes into your bank account as wanting readers , " said the author , who published his first novel 27 years ago .

the iranian govermnent said they were trying to interview the son of a woman sentenced to death by stoning . german foreign minister guido westerwelle said wednesday that he was doing all he could to secure the release of two journalists arrested in iran for interviewing " counter-revolutionaries " whilst on tourist visas .
" we are working with urgency to resolve this case , " westerwelle said .
he confirmed that the arrested men were german citizens , and that germany was still trying to contact them .
iran 's judiciary said on monday that the two were detained after interviewing the son of sakineh mohammadi ashtiani , the iranian woman whose stoning sentence was shelved last month following a global outcry .
working for release westerwelle has appealed to his iranian counterpart , manuscher mottaki , to personally take up the case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle has asked his iranian counterpart to intervene " we are working on all diplomatic levels and using all diplomatic channels to pursue the freeing of these two germans and returning them to germany as soon as possible , " westerwelle said .
the two detainees have not been named and it is not clear who they were working for .
initial reports suggested they may have been working for the bild am sonntag weekly newspaper .
hendrik zoerner , the spokesperson of the german journalists trade union , djv , said he contacted the newspaper for more information after the arrests were made public .
" at that time , their public stance was that they could not confirm or deny the reports .
and so we still do n't know who it was or who they were working for , " zoerner said .
some sources say the pair were a reporter and a photographer .
risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders calls iran 's media censorship ' disturbing ' the iranian government has accused the men of breaking iranian law by doing research without official accreditation . iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast also said the two germans were working with anti-revolutionary networks abroad .
" an anti-revolutionary group based in germany made the preparations for these two people to refer to ms mohammadi 's son , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman ramin mehmanparast told a weekly news conference on tuesday .
doing journalistic research in iran on a tourist visa is very dangerous , says , zoerner . " iran is not a free country and has been trying for years to hinder journalists who are practicing their profession . if you 're caught doing research there as a tourist , you 're taking a huge risk , " zoerner said .

but it stops short of imposing a moratorium , leaving that up to national states . the eu 's energy commissioner , guenther oettinger , admitted on wednesday , " i 'm a realist , " as he pulled back from a proposed moratorium on new deep-sea oil-drilling which he had supported in july .
on tuesday , the us government had lifted its ban on drilling in the gulf of mexico , which had been imposed followed the disastrous consequences of the explosion of bp 's deepwater horizon rig in the gulf of mexico .
the ban had been expected to run until november , but it had met with strong opposition from the oil industry and politicians in the area affected economically .
the decision to prevent new drilling in european water will now be left up to the individual member states , but britain , the country responsible for most of the oil wells , is strictly opposed .
polluters to pay more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther oettinger could not push through his moratorium instead , oettinger proposed standards which countries should adopt when granting licenses .
under the proposals , companies would have to show that they had enough funds to pay for any environmental damage a disaster might cause .
they would be responsible for all damage caused within 200 miles of a coastline , instead of the current 12-mile limit .
" we have to make sure that a disaster similar to the one in the gulf of mexico will never happen in european waters , " said oettinger .
the legislation , to harmonize conditions across europe , would be presented early next year .
it would require approval from both the eu ministers and the parliament , and it is already believed that britain will oppose it .
there are few deep-sea rigs in europe , but several are planned in the north sea and the black sea .
further wells are planned in libyan and egyptian waters , where the consequences of any catastrophe would be felt in europe .

the letter was posted on several chinese and english websites on wednesday .
it was later deleted from chatrooms on major portals , possibly by government censors , though it continued to crop up in more obscure chat rooms .
mao 's former secretary among the signatories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's former secretary li rui is among the signatories the letter lists the names of 23 signatories , among them li rui , a former secretary to mao zedong , hu jiwei , the retired editor-in-chief of the communist party newspaper people 's daily , and jiang ping , the retired head of the china university of political science and law .
several other signatories are known for their reformist sympathies .
the main thrust of the bluntly worded letter is that the government should implement article 35 of the chinese constitution approved in 1982 , which allows chinese citizens " freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession and of demonstration " .
the " former avowal and concrete denial " of this right is described as " false democracy " in the letter .
the signatories call upon the government to give editors and journalists the freedom to report without restrictions and to end the system of censors previewing media and book content .
worried about the premier 's rights the letter cites recent examples of censorship , going so far as to state : " even the premier of our country does not have the freedom of speech or of press " .
apparently , the official xinhua news agency did not report comments by premier wen jiabao on political reform made in an important speech last august in the southern city of shenzhen .
as regards the communist party , the letter says that if the party does not reform itself , it will lose its vitality and die a natural death .
chinese citizens have the right to know the errors of the ruling party , the letter says .

islam and muslims are met with particular reservations . the study released wednesday called " right-wing extremism in germany 2010 " argues that extreme views have penetrated to the heart of german society .
but , although between 10 and 20 percent of the population approve of traditional far-right positions such as the need for a dictator , or say that the nazis were n't so bad after all , policy makers will be more alarmed at the high levels of approval given to statements expressing disapproval of foreigners in germany .
for example , 32 percent approve of the statement that " when there 's a shortage of jobs , foreigners should be sent back home ; " 34 percent agree or strongly agree with the statement that " foreigners only come here to exploit germany 's social welfare system ; " and 35 percent think that " germany has a dangerous level of foreign influence as a result of the many foreigners in the country .

in each of these cases , approval was considerably higher in the former east germany than in the former west .
majority critical of islam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not only neo-nazis who hold extremist views the survey , which was carried out by a team of researchers from the university of leipzig for the friedrich ebert foundation , which is linked to the social democratic party , also found high levels of chauvinism across the board , with some 27 percent of the population thinking that the main task of the german government should be " to ensure that germany gets the power and influence it is entitled to . "
but extreme views turned into majority opinions when it came to islam , with 55 percent saying they could understand that people find arabs unpleasant , and 58 percent saying that the practice of the muslim religion should be " considerably restricted . "
indeed , an absolute majority of those who otherwise did not hold extremist views agreed with these two statements .
the survey was carried out in april , before the latest controversy over the role of islam in german society .
the researchers have carried out a similar survey every two years since 2002 , and , after the figures for 2008 -lrb- during an economic boom -rrb- turned out to be considerably lower than those of the years before , this year 's figures have returned roughly to the norm .
although the researchers argue that the survey proves that right-wing extremist views have reached the " middle " of society , their own figures show that such views are far more prevalent among the elderly , the poorly educated and the unemployed .

if the trials are successful , the eurostar monoply on the route could become a thing of the past . a train belonging to german rail operator deutsche bahn entered the channel tunnel that connects england with mainland europe for the first time on wednesday .
the ice3 train , built by the german company siemens , threatens to rival the monopoly held by the french-built eurostar train . since the trains still lack approval for the route between france and britain , they were pulled by a locomotive .
on board were staff from deutsche bahn and tunnel operator eurotunnel plus a technical team , but no passengers .
end of an era ?
the ice train was the first passenger train not operated by eurostar to use the tunnel , after eu rules required the tunnel be opened to competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurostar trains have had a monopoly on the tunnel france , which owns 55 percent of the cross-channel eurostar service , has reacted angrily to the company decision last week to buy trains worth about 600 million euros -lrb- $ 836 million -rrb- from siemens , rather than the french company alstom .
testing continues the train went only part of the way through the tunnel before returning to france .
a full trip to london is scheduled for next week .
deutsche bahn plans to offer passengers a high-speed connection with ice trains through the tunnel under the english channel by the end of 2013 .
about nine million passengers travel each year on the eurotstar train routes that connect brussels , london and paris .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 13.10.2010 uk startup ' internet eyes ' crowdsources retail surveillance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk is notorious for its use of cctv cameras for a small monthly fee , uk shop owners can have their surveillance cameras watched by internet users eager to catch shoplifters for a cash reward .
but some internet experts liken the concept to outsourcing police work . the united kingdom is notorious for its widespread use of cctv surveillance cameras .
now , a new internet startup is adding a twist to the privacy debate by bringing live streams of footage to viewers online .
devon-based " internet eyes " hopes to profit by rewarding internet users who spot and report shoplifters .
the rewards can be as much as 1,000 british pounds -lrb- 1,144 euros -rrb- , and internet privacy and civil liberties advocates describe the system as a privatization of law enforcement .
internet eyes went online on october 4 , and its founder , tony morgan , said the site has garnered more than 1,000 viewers who have reported more than 135 possible incidents .
the site prevents voyeurism by anonymizing feeds , which are switched every 20 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk has a long history of monitoring the public with cctv cameras " you ca n't use internet eyes for voyeuristic pleasures , " morgan told deutsche welle .
" we 've made sure that there 's no way this can be done .
with internet eyes you do n't know where you 're watching . "
service fee for businesses when a user reports suspicious activity , a text message is sent to two mobile phone numbers selected by the store owner .
it is then followed by a picture message of what was on the camera at the time .
immediately after reporting activity , users are transferred to a new feed so they ca n't see what transpires in the store .
internet eyes plans to make its money by charging a 75 pound monthly fee to storeowners who subscribe to the service , making it significantly less expensive than hiring a security guard .
the company is providing its service free of charge for three months in the uk in the hopes winning over customers .
" it 's very , very inexpensive , " morgan said .
" if a retailer does n't lose more than that -lrb- to shoplifting -rrb- during the course of a month , then he does n't need our service .
but that 's highly unlikely . "
morgan says the uk 's information commissioner 's office withdrew its initial objections to the service after internet eyes agreed to charge users a nominal fee to prevent abuse and limit itself to the european union .
likely to struggle on the european level bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers say cctv cameras are ineffective and intrusive but viktor mayer-schoenberger of the oxford internet institute says he believes internet eyes will run into trouble when it butts against the european union 's data protection directive .
" keep in mind that there is a huge risk , given the fact that no data protection commissioner has ruled on this as far as i can tell , " he told deutsche welle .
" they spoke with information commissioner 's office , but that does n't mean anything . "
the eu data protection directive creates a " minimum standard " for countries to meet , meaning what is legal in the uk might not be legal elsewhere , according to mayer-schoenberger .
" it 's an obvious solution given the power of crowdsourcing and internet economics – namely the fact that there are so many eyeballs out there on the net that can be brought to good use , " he said .
could foster bias and suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been abuses of over aggressive surveillance in the german corporate environment but regardless of internet eyes ' legal status , mayer-schoenberger objects to the service because of the social precedent it sets .
he sees it as the outsourcing of a law enforcement function to amateur private citizens , who have a higher likelihood of biases such as racial profiling .
" just pressing the button actually causes this scene to be investigated further , " he said " that 's pretty powerful , i 'd say .
that means i can direct the attention of law enforcement to something i find suspicious .
that 's a pretty powerful position . ”
mayer-schoenberger also said internet eyes ' built-in reward structure caters to suspicion and a host of other societal problems .
" from a business sense it makes perfect sense , " he said .
" from a legal perspective , whether or not its legal depends on complicated issues .
from a societal perspective , i 'd be extremely cautious . "
experts say cctv ineffective according to ross anderson , a professor of security engineering at the university of cambridge , cctv has been shown in research to be ineffective .
he described himself as being " shocked but not surprised " by the launch of internet eyes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founder of internet eyes says he 's helping small shopkeepers " it works in car parks , but almost nowhere else , " he wrote in an e-mail to deutsche welle .
" so in the long run , i expect this business to fail .
in the short run , it 's a symptom of the way in which many englishmen were persuaded to abandon their liberties one by one under both thatcher and blair .
so we might be thankful that policy in europe is also made by countries like germany , poland and lithuania , with more recent memories of oppression than we have . "
anderson pointed out that the united kingdom is currently being taken to court by the european commission for failing to effectively implement the data protection directive .
protects independent businesses but morgan argues his company 's service helps small , independent retailers , many of whom ca n't afford to hire security guards and are struggling to maintain their place in the commercial landscape .
" is n't it time we started to look after the independent retail chap instead of looking after the people that rob him ? " he said .
" we do so much to protect those that do the stealing , yet nothing for the poor chap who is trying to make a living . "

the letter was posted on several chinese and english websites on wednesday .
it was later deleted from chatrooms on major portals , possibly by government censors , though it continued to crop up in more obscure chat rooms .
mao 's former secretary among the signatories bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mao 's former secretary li rui is among the signatories the letter lists the names of 23 signatories , among them li rui , a former secretary to mao zedong , hu jiwei , the retired editor-in-chief of the communist party newspaper people 's daily , and jiang ping , the retired head of the china university of political science and law .
several other signatories are known for their reformist sympathies .
the main thrust of the bluntly worded letter is that the government should implement article 35 of the chinese constitution approved in 1982 , which allows chinese citizens " freedom of speech , of the press , of assembly , of association , of procession and of demonstration " .
the " former avowal and concrete denial " of this right is described as " false democracy " in the letter .
the signatories call upon the government to give editors and journalists the freedom to report without restrictions and to end the system of censors previewing media and book content .
worried about the premier 's rights the letter cites recent examples of censorship , going so far as to state : " even the premier of our country does not have the freedom of speech or of press " .
apparently , the official xinhua news agency did not report comments by premier wen jiabao on political reform made in an important speech last august in the southern city of shenzhen .
as regards the communist party , the letter says that if the party does not reform itself , it will lose its vitality and die a natural death .
chinese citizens have the right to know the errors of the ruling party , the letter says .

meanwhile hochtief is seeking political support and examining ways to thwart the bid . threatened by a possible hostile takeover , german construction giant hochtief has enlisted help from the political establishment .
the spanish construction company acs – which is already the company 's largest single shareholder with a nearly 30 percent stake – announced its takeover plans last month .
spd party leader sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief 's headquarters in essen on thursday to meet with its works council and gather information about the situation .
acs is set to submit its offer to germany 's financial regulator , bafin , for review on the same day .
a hochtief spokesman said until the acs offer has cleared bafin , it 's too early to describe it as hostile or otherwise .
nevertheless , the company is working on plans to combat the scenario .
“ we 're examining all options , ” he told deutsche welle .
if bafin approves the offer , it could be brought to shareholders by the end of december .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sigmar gabriel will visit hochtief to hear staff concerns about a possible takeover rapid international expansion in recent years , acs has been rapidly expanding outside of the spanish market .
phoebe kebbel of frankfurt-based hering schuppener , a consultancy representing the company in germany , told deutsche welle that “ for quite some time acs has been in the process of becoming significantly more international . ”
in 2009 , 25 percent of acs ' turnover was generated outside of spain , as compared to 40 percent today .
regardless of the outcome of its plans for hochtief , acs intends to source 50 percent of its turnover from outside of spain by 2012 , including its current 30 percent stake in hochtief .
“ internationalization is certainly a significant strategic focus for acs , but one way or another the company is headed in that direction , ” kebbel said .
kebbel said would n't describe acs ' intentions as hostile because hochtief would remain listed and headquartered in germany , although acs seeks a stake of more than 50 percent to financially consolidate the companies over time .
hochtief would be able to maintain a significant free float , and the two companies would become a leading market force in the western world .
“ the friendly intentions here are really justifiable , ” she said .
spanish market weak according to marc gabriel , an analyst with bankhaus lampe , acs has its sights set on hochtief 's international business , which accounts for 90 percent of its total turnover .
the spanish economy has particularly lagged in the real estate sector , eating into acs ' domestic business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hochtief chief herbert luetkestratkoetter is looking to fend off the spanish bid “ the market there is still bordering on a crisis , and that means the great profits they 've made in recent years are less , ” he told deutsche welle .
gabriel said hochtief has a number of options at its disposal to thwart a hostile bid .
the most drastic measure would be to transfer ownership of hochtief to its australian subsidiary leighton holdings .
hochtief may also consider a capital increase .
selling more shares would water down acs ' current stake in hochtief , forcing the heavily indebted company to buy many more shares to gain control of the german group , gabriel said .
gabriel added that hochtief 's executives should view the takeover bid as hostile because instead of approaching the german firm with the offer of a negotiation , acs kept its plans secret until they were made public through an information leak , he said .
hochtief has 66,000 employees worldwide , including 11,000 in germany .
a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

a takeover by acs would create one of the world 's largest construction companies .

due to privacy concerns and german law , google is allowing residents to opt-out before october 15 by submitting a form online .
that will blur the facade of individual homes once the site becomes public .
a spokesperson for google germany , lena wagner , responded to deutsche welle 's questions about street view by e-mail .
deutsche welle : how many people have opted out of street view in germany ?
lena wagner : we 're not able to give you an exact figure for the number of letters we have received because that is n't yet clear .
for example , some of the letters are duplicates , others relate to other products and some are spam .
we encourage those who do n't want their houses to appear on street view to use the tool , and once we know what the total figure is we 'll publish it .
is google worried about setting a precedent here in germany for other countries to follow - that is , to let them opt-out of the service ?
we agreed to pre-publication opt-out in germany due to the unique position in german law and we have no plans to do this in other countries at this time .
is google at all concerned about what signal it sends when one opts-out ?
we take privacy very seriously .
while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service .
that 's why we provide easily accessible tools for flagging imagery for review and removal and to pre-publication opt-out their property .
has google had any requests from other countries or citizens to allow them to have the same deal as in germany ?
as we 've said before , we 're not offering this elsewhere .
we have practical , easy to use proven privacy controls built into street view which work really well around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google street view currently is available in 13 european countries what will google do with the names / addresses data that people submit to be used for opting out in germany ?
the data is necessary to identify the house which was requested to be blurred .
we will only use it in order to process the request .
we will delete the data within a period which has been agreed upon with the -lsb- data protection authority -rsb- after the requests have been processed .
does google think that germans ' fears of street view are rational ?
many fears are based on misinformation such as street view imagery is real-time - in fact it is anywhere between a few months to up to two years old at the time a given area is introduced .
we take privacy protections very seriously and that 's why we have developed state of the art operational and technological controls for street view , -lsb- for example -rsb- including the automatic blurring of faces and licence plates .
does google recognize that there are different cultural standards of privacy in different countries ?
no two countries are ever the same and we work with the authorities in every country to address concerns they may have about street view .
all images in our street view product abide by the local laws and cultural norms of the country they are taken in and street view only features imagery taken on public property .
it 's also worth putting this in context - this imagery is no different from what any person can readily capture or see walking down the street themselves .
imagery of this kind is available in a wide variety of formats for cities all around the world and on various sites on the web .
have there been many examples of people / cities contacting google to say that they support street view ?
the city oberstaufen is a great example of cities which would like to have street view imagery of their streets .
the citizens even made a movie to encourage us to come to their city so that they can show its beauty worldwide .
what are the plans for further expansion of street view in germany and the rest of europe ?
we 've already launched street view in 13 european countries and will add the 20 biggest cities in germany within this year .
we hope to add further locations in time .

its construction initially sparked protests , but now some are hoping it could be a sign of integration for muslims . poland , like many other european countries , is trying to find ways of integrating , or co-existing with , its immigrant population .
the country has a growing muslim community , fed by immigrants from syria , iraq and libya , who are attracted by poland 's membership of the european union .
polish authorities have begun granting permission to construct several mosques in the country .
in warsaw , a project to build a cultural center initially proved controversial , and was opposed by traditional roman catholic groups .
but others were more supportive .
liberal christian , jewish and lay groups expressed solidarity for the rights of muslims to practice their religion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw 's main mosque houses the the muslim religious union in poland the islamic cultural center being built in warsaw has been designed to fit in with polish architectural tradition .
salim ismail of the polish islamic league stressed that care was taken to avoid symbols that poland 's roman catholic majority might find offensive .
" there is no minaret to remind the faithful of prayer times , " ismail said . " our idea was to make the center multi-functional … we want to build bridges and forge contacts . "
along with a prayer room the center will house a gallery , a multimedia center and library .
the organizers behind the construction of the warsaw islamic cultural center hope that the instituion will serve to change stereotypes about muslims in the wider community .
to help them get their message across , they have turned to poland 's own established muslim community , the tartars .
poland 's native muslim population polish tartars , who practice islam , are an ethnic group that came from the crimea to settle in poland 600 years ago .
this small , but influential community has traditionally provided warriors for polish armies .
there are also a number of prominent polish academics and artists who are descended from the tartars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tartars have been in poland for over 300 years , settling here after the battle for vienna .
writer selim chazbijewicz thinks that polish tartars are aware of their potential role as a bridge between polish and islamic cultures .
" we tartars are part of polish culture , " chazbijewicz told deutsche welle .
" in fact , we are probably the only living reminder of how diverse poland 's society used to be in past centuries … we want to preserve traces of our culture in libraries and archives , because we realize that within two to three generations , polish tartars may melt into the rest of polish society . "
polish tourists enjoy going to see historic wooden mosques in traditional tartar villages like kruszyniany in the northeast of the country .
the visibility of tartar culture helps ordinary poles realize that muslims are also part of the the country 's heritage .
but there are some in poland , like leftwing politician tadeusz iwinski , who believe that it is not enough to keep the tradition alive for the tourists .
iwinski wants poland 's growing muslim community to develop a formal relationship with the state , along the lines of the concordat which currently outlines the state 's relations with christian churches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a deeply catholic country " major churches , especially the dominant roman catholic church , are involved in regular consultations with the authorities to thrash out problems .
i believe polish muslims should enjoy the same rights as christiansm , " iwinski said .
given the strong emphasis usually placed on christian values in poland 's daily political and social life , minority groups are encouraged that attention is now being paid to their rights too .

the design , which honours the london 2012 olympics , will appear on 50p coins from 13 october 2010 .
it is part of new batch of coins representing the 29 olympic and paralympic sports .
each new coin was designed by a member of the public following a national competition that received nearly 30,000 original entries .
art graduate thomas babbage , originally from tredington near shipston-on-stour , saw the advert for the competition on the internet and decided to submit a number of designs for the different sports in a variety of styles .
thomas babbage has visited the royal mint where all 29 designs have been made into coins he told bbc coventry & warwickshire : " the horse one was the one they decided was good to put on a coin .
it 's quite small but the image of a horse jumping over fences is not entirely how you might expect it to .
they 've used the crosshatching from my drawing in the 3d casting so it 's quite unusual . "
he added : " it 's a special feeling , you are down in history to a certain extent .
" it 's strange but nice to know you 've done something that will go into people 's pockets .
but i 'm keeping my feet on the ground ! "
royal approval from nearly 30,000 entries submitted , mr babbage was one of just 29 winners .
all the winning designs had to obtain final approval from the treasury and the queen .
dave knight , the royal mint 's director of commemorative coins , said : " every one of the winners is making history .
their coins will become treasured mementos of the biggest sporting event to happen on uk shores for over half a century and we hope will encourage a new generation of collectors .
the youngest competition winner was florence jackson , aged nine " every coin captures the spirit , excitement and passion of the olympics .
in isolation each is a work of art , together they are an inspirational portrait of a sporting phenomenon .
" the royal mint is immensely proud to be part of london 2012 and we 're thrilled that this competition has enabled the general public to play a part too . "
mr babbage 's design will eventually be found on three million 50p coins , starting to be seen in general circulation from october .

more than 40 people have died as a result of crashes on roads policed by avon and somerset constabulary so far this year .
but september saw 13 of those deaths accounting for almost a third of the entire year 's fatalities .
chief inspector polly king , from the avon and somerset road policing unit , answered questions on how they are trying to bring that number down .
q , what has caused this jump in deaths on the region 's roads ?
we really do n't know .
while clearly there is an investigation going on into all of those 13 deaths there does n't appear to be any common factor in terms of location , time of day , type of vehicle or age of driver .
every single one of those deaths is tragic and has brought about enormous suffering to family and friends .
q , is the problem down to motorists being too casual on the road ?
i think that is certainly some of the issue but for me the tragic reality is that the vast majority of collisions are actually preventable .
in policing circles , we talk about the ' fatal four ' - and i make no excuse for using such a horrible term .
there are four main contributory factors to collisions , particularly to those involving serious injuries and fatalities .
they are : excessive or inappropriate speed , people driving while they are under the influence of drinks or drugs , people using a mobile phone and also failing to wear a seatbelt .
if you do any of those four things you are gambling with your life and other people 's lives .
q , is the message about safe driving not getting through to motorists ?
it is about time people began taking personal responsibility for their driving behaviour .
the four things that i have mentioned are all changeable .
it 's about individuals looking at their driving behaviour and just making those changes .
we undertake a number of education packages and we know that particularly around speed that an appropriate mixture of education , enforcement and engineering changes to our roads will really make a difference .
q , what do you think about the trend of speed cameras being taken down ?
speed cameras are only a part of our enforcement operation and we 'll continue our sustained efforts with the west of england road safety partnership to look at education , enforcement and environmental changes .

in a public meeting on 12 october the board agreed to omit the two villages from its future plans .
under government rules , 2400 new homes must be built in purbeck by the year 2026 .
residents of wool argued that 191 new homes have already been built around the village in the last five years .
however corfe castle residents said that new affordable housing was desperately needed by locals .
local resident michael bond said the decision had " killed " corfe castle .
the council agreed to review its policy if a developer offered to build housing that was 100 % affordable .
rachel , a mother from corfe castle , told the meeting that her family had lived in corfe for five generations but she could not afford a property there .
" i want to stay but my house is unfit to live in , " she said .
" my choice is to leave the village i grew up in or live in a house full of damp and mould . "
priced out councillor wendy starr pointed out that the average wage in purbeck is £ 22,880 , with most mortgage lenders offering to lend a maximum of three times a person 's or married couple 's salary to buy a home .
i 'm trying to stop small dorset villages becoming exclusively the right of the rich and wealthy councillor gary suttle according to latest figures from the land registry of england and wales , the average price of a property in purbeck is £ 268,249 .
councillor gary suttle proposed that " affordable housing " should mean houses costing £ 100,000 or less and that for every two dwellings built , one should be put on the market at a lower price .
" i 'm trying to stop small dorset villages becoming exclusively the right of the rich and wealthy , " he said .
the council also voted to continue looking for potential sites in swanage on which to build 200 dwellings , with between 40 - 100 offered at affordable prices .
two of the four identified so far - a former grammar school and recreation area herston fields - have met with considerable opposition from local residents .
swanage warning stephen foote of the save herston fields group presented the council with a petition signed by 2974 people in support of the campaign .
" over the past 15 years swanage has seen some 750 dwelling built - that represents 34 % of all new development for the whole of purbeck , " he said .
" this relentless development is not sustainable and has to stop . "
purbeck marbler dave glassock said that a seam of marble which runs from peveril point to worbarrow tout is " smack underneath " the fields , meaning that there is also water running underneath it out to sea .
" if you stop the flow it will run onto the railway and flood swanage , " he warned .
the public meeting was arranged to continue discussions that begain on 5 october when over 400 purbeck residents , including the actor edward fox , came to wareham to debate the council 's proposals .
" i 'm really pleased with the outcome of the meetings , " said planning policy manager steve dring .
" we 've agreed something with a focus on affordable housing .
we have to balance the needs of the wider district with the people who live next door . "

advertisement penelope keith spoke to members of the trust actress penelope keith has visited derby 's hippodrome theatre to support the group fighting to save it .
the good life star is backing the derby hippodrome restoration trust 's plans to buy the disused venue from its current owner and restore it .
derby city council has started on thousands of pounds worth of repairs to make the green lane theatre safe .
but keith , who is starring in the rivals in nottingham , says the venue deserves to be restored .
she told bbc east midlands today : " it 's a listed building and it should be preserved .
it 's part of derby 's history .
" any theatre is close to my heart and this deserves to be preserved but as with anything , it needs money . "
the grade ii-listed venue was built in 1914 and has been variously used as a theatre , cinema and bingo hall .
but the hippodrome has been disused since 2007 and derby city council has been in dispute with the building 's current owner over its upkeep .
the building has been up for sale since december 2009 and the dhrt is hoping to gather enough support to not only buy the venue but also convert it into a modern theatre .

the group works with young people who are at risk of running away .
it has set up a charity shop in meadowhall , selling the celebrity items .
the charity chicks store will be staffed by volunteers , with every penny raised going directly to the charity .
the shop has been operated before , both times in dinnington where safe @ last has its base .
this is the first time it has been run on such a scale .
safe @ last was established in june 2000 .
ten years on the charity provides a range of services for young runaways including the only emergency refuge outside london for children aged 16 and under .
items donated to help its latest fundraising campaign include sienna miller 's roberto cavalli sunglasses and the herve leger dress which fern britton wore during her last ever ' this morning ' appearance .
fashion designer , wayne hemingway , who founded the red or dead brand , was at meadowhall to perform the opening and lend his support to the venture : " the main idea is to get people who 're in the public eye to hand something over and that brings attention to it , and that brings other people to the store . "
the celebrity items will not have designer price tags , but wayne hemingway hoped people would be more generous : this sparkly top was given to the charity by twiggy " if i was going in there as a punter and it was normal charity shop prices , i 'd be thinking i 'd donate a bit more , would n't you ?
" this is great because it raises money for a good charity - just a great idea really . "
the celebrity items will be available on a first come first serve basis , with others being auctioned throughout the week .

with a new video for their single innocent flow and a support slot with x factor 's danyl johnson they look like they are on their way .
lead singer ben smith explains the process for making the video .
" it was filmed by oliver heyward who is the fifth member of the band and our live sound engineer .
" he filmed us recording the song in the studio , whilst making a video diary .
" we did n't start out thinking we were going to make a video .
it all happened very organically so i think that 's why it works .
" then he took the footage away and made the video himself .
it 's just pure us having fun and making music .
there is no acting .
" the recordings are what we are actually doing on the record - none of it is mimed so it all looks real , because it is .
" videos are a fantastic source of engaging your audience , it 's not been up very long - maybe two months - and already we 've had over 3,000 views on youtube and over 700 people have shared it on facebook , which we are all overjoyed about .
" i think videos are still very important .
it also puts faces to the music .
youtube is a very strong tool to have , i would n't say we depend on it but it helps for sure . "
big move the four-piece band includes members daniel western , liam barnes and james ashby - ben , liam and james have all recently moved in together , which they say is helping the harmony of the band .
" it 's good for the creative , " says liam .
" we really get to feel out each others creative places and can bounce off each other with ideas all the time . "
" it 's just living it , " says ben .
" we 've gone from it being our hobby to being our job .
we wake up in the morning , we write songs , if we have n't got any money we teach .
it 's just a way of life now .
" and we 've moved out of home .
we 've just grown up and i think that shows in the music .
it 's a more mature sound . "
so can living together and being in a band together become too much ?
" we all do our own thing , " says liam .
" we do other stuff just to get out of it .
it 's great because you go out and do other stuff and then come back refreshed .
" you can have too much of a good thing .
you can have too much of the guys .
" but it never feels like a burden , because we 're always enjoying it . "
" we 're all just great friends , " says ben .
" everyone argues but we get on so well most of the time and once we 've finished playing music we will go out on the town together .
we will relax and chill together .
" music is n't a chore .
we all love doing it . "
celebrity support drummer daniel spoke about the band 's forthcoming gig supporting danyl at sub89 in reading .
" we 've been friends with danyl for a long time , " dan says .
" i 've known him for 10 years , he actually supported us at our first album launch 2 years ago , so he asked us if we 'd like to do this gig with him .
the quotes will support danyl johnson in reading " he 's a keen supporter of the band and often comes to gigs .
in fact he was at our last bbc introducing show at the oakford .
" we 're really looking forward to it .
it looks like it 's going to be a busy night and we like big crowds . "
drummer dan joined the band in november last year and the other band members admit it 's been the best thing for them .
" it 's amazing , " ben says .
" he is just a great guy .
he is wicked and an awesome drummer .
it 's been so good since he joined the band , everything is falling into place .
" hopefully everyone will be able to hear in the songs .
his influence on the tracks is a little bit more rock .
we 've gone from an indie / rock band to more rock now - we 're not really an indie band anymore .
it 's rock .
" he loves led zeppelin , bonham is his biggest influence and you can hear his passion in the songs now so he 's fitted in perfectly . "
so will the boys be going down the commercial pop route like aborfield-born danyl .
" he chose to go down a completely different path than us .
so we wish him all the success in the world but we wo n't be tapping him up for simon cowell 's number just yet .
" we 're more and rock ' n ' roll . "
the four-piece will be hitting the gig circuit heavily in the next few months .
on 17 october they will play the wilde theatre in bracknell supported by borderline : fire on 21 october they play with danyl johnson at sub 89 on 10 november they play the bbc introducing night at the oakford social club in reading on 18 november they will be at the proud galleries in camden bookmark with : delicious digg reddit facebook stumbleupon what are these ?

it will include removing asbestos as well as restoring all the working parts of the engine and boiler .
bruce knights , manager of the eastleigh works said : " we are hoping to find it 's in pretty good condition and we can get it to a1 working nick for the next 80 years .
" the real important part is to see it leave the site in steam - there will be some moist eyes then , i think . "
few other sites are large enough to carry out a full renovation the return of the cheltenham is a landmark for the eastleigh works which was at the hub of locomotive building and repair in britain for almost 100 years .
it closed in 2005 but re-opened three years later to work on refitting modern trains .

the rescue operation at the san jose mine is now well underway , with the hope that all 33 will soon be safe .
keith hartshorne , national union of mineworkers branch delegate at kellingley , said he felt relieved .
he said : " they are just absolutely amazing scenes .
an outcome like this is truly unbelievable . "
the first of the 33 miners trapped underground were winched to the surface in a special rescue capsule amid scenes of jubilation .
miners at kellingley colliery near knottingley have been closely following developments in northern chile .
" fantastic job " keith hartshorne said he was amazed at the fortitude the miners have shown during their long wait for rescue .
he said : " my heart goes out to them .
i think they have done a fantastic job to get them out .
" for the lads down there for that amount of time to be so disciplined just goes to show how well-organised they have been as a unit . "
keith said that the most difficult moment of the rescue would probably have been when the drilling operation first reached the miners .
to come up and see the euphoria , the emotion and the reunited families , it 's absolutely incredible .
keith hartshorne , num delegate , kellingley he explained : " we have all had accidents when we have been drilling through things - whether it 's a wall or a piece of wood .
" the last little bit is crucial .
you need to ease off the pressure otherwise you will end up with a mess .
" you have got to have a clear-cut hole to get this capsule up with the lads in . "
keith said he had a little experience of what the 33 chilean miners would have faced during their incarceration .
he said : " there was an incident in the shaft and we were underground for 18 hours .
that 's nothing compared to this .
" they did send us some food and water down and it was n't too much of an ordeal .
" we knew we were going to get out , not like they did when they were trapped for 17 days and nobody knew where they were . "
many difficulties the chilean miners have been in dim conditions underground for such a long time that they need to wear sunglasses to protect their eyes as they emerge from the rescue capsule .
however , keith hartshorne said there may be many other difficulties facing them , too .
he said : " it will have affected they all in different ways .
there will be some in there who are desperate to get out .
" let 's face it , some of them will be at breaking point . "
" when you 're underground you just want to come up and pick up the pieces as they were .
" from what i gather , it could be quite hard for those at the top as well as those underground . "
kellingley : the risks of going underground are the same everywhere as the night shift ended at kellingley colliery , miners there were happy to discover the rescue operation in chile was well underway .
watching developments , keith said it was quite an emotional time - even thousands of miles away from the unfolding events .
he said : " there are n't many people who can imagine what they are going through .
" to come up and see the euphoria , the emotion and the reunited families , it 's absolutely incredible . "

work has begun to remove a derelict building on the seafront that has not been used since 1994 .
the structure , condemned as unsafe , was once used as an aquarium .
it is one of several projects that together will revamp the town 's esplanade .
the work to remove the building is expected to take three weeks .
cllr howard legg , chair of the seafront regeneration board , said : " the removal of this redundant building is a critical part in the programme of the seafront regeneration project . "
he said its demolition clears the area ready for the construction of new facilities for visitors - a food kiosk and a beach rescue hut .
victorian lights the building has been derelict since 1994 .
the programme will improve the area ahead of the sailing events of the london 2012 olympic games , to be held in the borough .
it also includes work to widen the pavement between bond street and new street ; 16 fewer car parking spaces on the seafront ; and the refurbishment of public toilets .
plans to remove the old victorian " fairy " street lights will also go ahead , despite some public opposition .
they will be replaced by a more efficient-to-run " laser " lighting scheme , called veils of light - seven 16-metre-tall steel columns along the seafront , sending a beam of light out to sea after dark until midnight .
the victorian sheltered seating areas , from the 1880s , will also be refurbished and have " subtle " lighting installed , mr legg said .
he added that english heritage has been consulted for work that involves all of the seafront 's victorian structures .
and last july , the tourist information office -lrb- tic -rrb- kiosk was relocated from the centre of the esplanade to the foyer of the weymouth pavilion theatre .
mr legg says the move will be reviewed next october as was always planned .
the building is now let to a holiday homes business .
but he said : " some resorts in the south west do n't have a tic .
we 're maintaining that service . "
scaled back cllr legg : " we 're doing it to make weymouth a better place to live . "
the esplanade plans were originally much more ambitious .
there were plans to create a paved george iii square around the statue of the monarch , and a complete refurbishment of the pier bandstand area .
but in june 2009 the project was scaled back after it lost £ 6.6m of funding from the south west regional development agency , after its own budget was reduced significantly .
mr legg said : " it would have been nice to pedestrianise the square .
i still think we 're doing pretty well but we could have done better .
" some of the plans can still go ahead , but parts of it are now an " upgrade " project rather than a " remodelling " . "
but not everyone in weymouth is so enthusiastic about the work on the esplanade .
weymouth businessman jeremy peel yates runs a tanning salon in the town centre .
he says he and his customers are too concerned about the extensive and ongoing road works in the town - a £ 9m scheme designed to ease congestion that began in june - to notice work on the seafront .
he said : " the road works are driving us all nuts .
people are not coming into weymouth unless they have to .
" i talk to other business owners and tourist trade is already down .
people do n't like holidaying in a building site . "
the seafront regeneration , funded jointly by dorset county council and weymouth and portland borough council , english heritage , wessex water and southern electric , as well as funding from private businesses , will make the whole area " more enticing " , says mr legg .
" i think it will feel more open , and visually more attractive .
" we 're doing it to make weymouth a better place to live and visit . "
