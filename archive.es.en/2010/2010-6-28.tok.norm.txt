program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 28.06.2010 race for knowledge spurs physics research at cern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc has been producing collisions since march the large hadron collider is coming late to the party and has a lot to prove in the particle physics community .
it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .

jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .

still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .

germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .

such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 28.06.2010 mueller 's heroics are typical of new ' young germany ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller , the man of the match , is 20 years old the german squad that beat england to progress to the quarterfinals is the youngest ever with an average age of 25 .
but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

meanwhile , anti g-20 protests continued in the streets of toronto . world leaders at the group of 20 summit on sunday pledged to cut their national deficits in half by 2013 and agreed to let members set levies on their banks , but rejected calls for a worldwide tax on financial transactions .
on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .
“ frankly , the outcome was better than i expected , ” said german chancellor angela merkel .
she said leaders had come up with a formula for debt reduction that would not harm growth , a plan that “ corresponds exactly to our timeline . ”
" our challenges are as diverse as our nations , " said us president barack obama .
" but together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy , and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time . "
" there are a range of policy approaches to this end .
some countries are pursuing a financial levy .
other countries are pursuing different approaches , " leaders said in the summit 's final report , which took negotiators at least 45 hours to draft .

" i am still all excited , " she told reporters .
" i can only say to the german team , go on like this - it was great .

police adopted a more aggressive strategy sunday by going into the crowd to make arrests , compared to saturday when they stood back as protesters torched four police cars and vandalized stores and banks .
a heavy downpour and severe thunderstorm warning discouraged some protesters , though clashes continued into the evening .
despite the reported violence , toronto police said no serious injuries were reported among police , protesters and bystanders .

but the financial crisis pushed other important topics - like climate change , say , or the fight against poverty and hunger - right off the agenda . at this point , even the wealthy nations themselves are admitting that they have n't kept their promises to poorer countries .
maybe that is why more recent promises - like the initiative to fight maternal and infant death , proposed here in toronto , - are somewhat more modest .

or save the lives of 800,000 infants .
or , you can spend that money on a gigantic summit meeting , like the one that took place in canada over the weekend .
the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations - and later of the 20 most important economies - met in toronto .
considering the financial cost of the meeting , the results were weak .
one plan on the table but there is also another way of looking at it : considering how much money has been spent recently on rescuing banks and even entire nations , a billion dollars is n't much at all .
the global financial markets need a new structure - that much is beyond question .
but when it comes to figuring out how top politicians should go about making these changes , the devil is in the details .
the financial world has entire legions of lobbyists out fighting against over-regulation .
economies ca n't function without money , and indeed , regulations ca n't be so tight that they squeeze the life out of the banks .
an economy ca n't function without liquidity .
but banks need to resume their original role - that of service-providers to the economy - not of gamblers who do n't know their limits .
also , they have to be able to go bankrupt without pulling the entire financial system into ruin .
a plan for a new architecture for our global financial system is on the table .
us president barack obama proudly unveiled it in toronto .
in washington , congress is expected to pass the law this week .
the europeans were impressed - and will need to get moving in order to come up with their own plan .
surprises and disappointments the summit was preceded by the rolling thunder of discord ; america versus germany , spending versus austerity . but in the end , reason prevailed .
the ambitious formula : growth through intelligent austerity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme these kinds of conflicts are important .
in the final analysis , the players find themselves on virgin political soil .
no one can come up with the ultimate solution , because every country is faced with different conditions .
thus , the debate has no winners and no losers - and that was the big surprise that came out of toronto .
but the financial crisis pushed other important topics - like climate change , say , or the fight against poverty and hunger - right off the agenda . at this point , even the wealthy nations themselves are admitting that they have n't kept their promises to poorer countries .
maybe that is why more recent promises - like the initiative to fight maternal and infant death , proposed here in toronto , - are somewhat more modest .
it is miserable to see how much money wealthy countries are willing and able to throw around in order to keep their own heads above water .
and that was the big disappointment that came out of toronto .
a new litmus test be that as it may , the g20 nations need to come together .
at some point , the crisis that forced them to come together , will be over .
and the introduction of financial market reforms could divide the group .
the g20 is different from the g8 in that all the countries do n't share the same values .
it sounds positive when china not only loosens its monetary policy ahead of the meeting , but then goes on to advocate sustainable growth during the summit itself .
in any case , the real litmus test for the g20 still lies ahead , since many of the important decisions for a new world financial order were pushed back to the coming summit in south korea .
the big crisis is n't far behind us .
and only in seoul will we be able to look back and gauge the success - or lack thereof - of the toronto summit .

necas will lead a center-right coalition that plans to rein in the country 's debt . one month after parliamentary elections , czech president vaclav klaus has named petr necas as the country 's new president .
" i am convinced the government is in the right hands .
i believe you will manage to put a cabinet together in a short time , " klaus told necas in the capital , prague on monday .
the appointment brings the czech republic one step closer to formation of a new center-right government .
necas , 45 , heads the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which emerged as the strongest party from the may election . it is now in coalition talks with the conservative top 09 and the populist public affairs party .
necas said he aimed to complete the coalition deal by july 7 and have the cabinet in place by the middle of july .
once the government is appointed , it has 30 days to pass a confidence vote in the parliament 's lower house .
the new cabinet is expected to take measures aimed at halting the growth of debt , fighting corruption , supporting the economy and boosting the rule of law .
the new government is to replace a caretaker government led by jan fischer , which has ruled the czech republic for the past 14 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 28.06.2010 race for knowledge spurs physics research at cern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc has been producing collisions since march the large hadron collider is coming late to the party and has a lot to prove in the particle physics community .
it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

russia , meanwhile , remains skeptical about kyrgyzstan 's aspirations . opposition leaders said on monday that they were wary of the results of the weekend referendum , which was hailed by the interim government as an overwhelming display of the country 's desire for a new constitution .
adakhan madumarov , leader of the batun kyrgyzstan party , said the figures were " impossibly high " given the ongoing fallout from deadly ethnic riots that rocked the south of the country earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election commission said turnout was at 69 percent kyrgyzstan 's central election commission said that over 90 percent of voters had approved the plan to make the country a parliamentary republic .
at this point , over 95 percent of districts in kyrgyzstan have reported their results , with voter turnout at just under 70 percent .
" i highly doubt that the central election commission 's data reflects the real picture , as monitors from our party on the ground give conflicting information , " madumarov said .
the former interior minister and head of the ata-zhurt opposition party , omurbek suvanaliyev described the figures as fantasy and accused the interim government of " massive falsification " in the registration of voters .
' overwhelming success ' interim kyrgyz leader roza otunbayeva said the referendum on sunday was an overwhelming success , adding that it had taken place without incident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otunbayeva , center , will stay in power until 2011 " the new constitution has been adopted , despite the savage attacks of its opponents , " otunbayeva told a news conference in the capital , bishkek .
otunbayeva remained convinced that the divisions in the country would not get in the way of her interim government 's plans for reform .
" today the people of kyrgyzstan are voting for stability in the country and the legality of the authorities , " otunbayeva said .
" we will show the world that kyrgyzstan is united . "
the interim government defiantly pressed ahead with the vote despite deadly clashes between minority uzbeks and majority kyrgyz earlier this month , which sparked fears of a collapse of the country .
medvedev skeptical russian president dmitri medvedev , speaking after the g20 summit in toronto , expressed doubt as to whether the country was ready for a parliamentary democracy - or even whether kyrgyz authorities could impose order at present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev says kyrgyzstan is too unstabile for democracy " in its current state , there are a host of scenarios for kyrgyzstan , including the most unpleasant scenario - the collapse of the state , " medvedev said . at least 294 people were killed this month in violence between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan , a former soviet republic which hosts us and russian military air bases and shares a border with china . author : gabriel borrud -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 28.06.2010 race for knowledge spurs physics research at cern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc has been producing collisions since march the large hadron collider is coming late to the party and has a lot to prove in the particle physics community .
it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .

sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .

meanwhile , anti g-20 protests continued in the streets of toronto . world leaders at the group of 20 summit on sunday pledged to cut their national deficits in half by 2013 and agreed to let members set levies on their banks , but rejected calls for a worldwide tax on financial transactions .
on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .
“ frankly , the outcome was better than i expected , ” said german chancellor angela merkel .
she said leaders had come up with a formula for debt reduction that would not harm growth , a plan that “ corresponds exactly to our timeline . ”
" our challenges are as diverse as our nations , " said us president barack obama .
" but together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy , and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time . "
" there are a range of policy approaches to this end .
some countries are pursuing a financial levy .
other countries are pursuing different approaches , " leaders said in the summit 's final report , which took negotiators at least 45 hours to draft .
transaction tax rejected however , the report was also seen as a blow to european ambitions as it made no reference to a financial transaction tax , a proposal rejected by a " vast majority " of g-20 leaders " at once , " according to diplomatic sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron , right , merkel took time out to watch the world cup merkel , who along with the leaders of britain and france had pushed hard for worldwide support of the tax , admitted that the outcome was less than she had hoped for .
britain , france and germany are all expected to introduce their own bank levies later this year , and the us is also planning a similar move .
merkel had reason to be more upbeat earlier in the day , as she took time out from the conference to watch the second half of the germany-england match with british prime minister david cameron , which germany won 4-1 .
" i am still all excited , " she told reporters .
" i can only say to the german team , go on like this - it was great .
today everything went perfectly in the heads and in the legs . "
clashes continue as world leaders talked and watched the world cup in the convention center , anti g-20 demonstrators continued to protest in numerous locations outside the tightly controlled security perimeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continued on sunday at least 600 protesters had been arrested by late afternoon , as standoffs saw police in full riot gear firing tear gas for the second straight day .
" police are continuing to arrest people who engage in criminal activity , " said police spokeswoman jenn geary .
" if they breach security they 're going to be arrested . "
police adopted a more aggressive strategy sunday by going into the crowd to make arrests , compared to saturday when they stood back as protesters torched four police cars and vandalized stores and banks .
a heavy downpour and severe thunderstorm warning discouraged some protesters , though clashes continued into the evening .
despite the reported violence , toronto police said no serious injuries were reported among police , protesters and bystanders .

russia , meanwhile , remains skeptical about kyrgyzstan 's aspirations . opposition leaders said on monday that they were wary of the results of the weekend referendum , which was hailed by the interim government as an overwhelming display of the country 's desire for a new constitution .
adakhan madumarov , leader of the batun kyrgyzstan party , said the figures were " impossibly high " given the ongoing fallout from deadly ethnic riots that rocked the south of the country earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election commission said turnout was at 69 percent kyrgyzstan 's central election commission said that over 90 percent of voters had approved the plan to make the country a parliamentary republic .

for instance , you can provide access to clean drinking water for 50 million people .
or save the lives of 800,000 infants .
or , you can spend that money on a gigantic summit meeting , like the one that took place in canada over the weekend .
the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations - and later of the 20 most important economies - met in toronto .
considering the financial cost of the meeting , the results were weak .
one plan on the table but there is also another way of looking at it : considering how much money has been spent recently on rescuing banks and even entire nations , a billion dollars is n't much at all .
the global financial markets need a new structure - that much is beyond question .
but when it comes to figuring out how top politicians should go about making these changes , the devil is in the details .
the financial world has entire legions of lobbyists out fighting against over-regulation .
economies ca n't function without money , and indeed , regulations ca n't be so tight that they squeeze the life out of the banks .
an economy ca n't function without liquidity .
but banks need to resume their original role - that of service-providers to the economy - not of gamblers who do n't know their limits .
also , they have to be able to go bankrupt without pulling the entire financial system into ruin .
a plan for a new architecture for our global financial system is on the table .
us president barack obama proudly unveiled it in toronto .
in washington , congress is expected to pass the law this week .
the europeans were impressed - and will need to get moving in order to come up with their own plan .
surprises and disappointments the summit was preceded by the rolling thunder of discord ; america versus germany , spending versus austerity . but in the end , reason prevailed .
the ambitious formula : growth through intelligent austerity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme these kinds of conflicts are important .
in the final analysis , the players find themselves on virgin political soil .
no one can come up with the ultimate solution , because every country is faced with different conditions .
thus , the debate has no winners and no losers - and that was the big surprise that came out of toronto .
but the financial crisis pushed other important topics - like climate change , say , or the fight against poverty and hunger - right off the agenda . at this point , even the wealthy nations themselves are admitting that they have n't kept their promises to poorer countries .
maybe that is why more recent promises - like the initiative to fight maternal and infant death , proposed here in toronto , - are somewhat more modest .
it is miserable to see how much money wealthy countries are willing and able to throw around in order to keep their own heads above water .
and that was the big disappointment that came out of toronto .
a new litmus test be that as it may , the g20 nations need to come together .
at some point , the crisis that forced them to come together , will be over .
and the introduction of financial market reforms could divide the group .
the g20 is different from the g8 in that all the countries do n't share the same values .
it sounds positive when china not only loosens its monetary policy ahead of the meeting , but then goes on to advocate sustainable growth during the summit itself .
in any case , the real litmus test for the g20 still lies ahead , since many of the important decisions for a new world financial order were pushed back to the coming summit in south korea .
the big crisis is n't far behind us .
and only in seoul will we be able to look back and gauge the success - or lack thereof - of the toronto summit .

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '

how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .

" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .

" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .

the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues .

in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .

the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues .

argentina are undefeated thus far , and the question is : are they good , very good or world-class ? when germany 's young squad takes to the pitch against argentina on saturday in cape town , they will be forgiven if they 're a bit awe-struck .
lining up on the other side will be a living legend with a short fuse , the consensus choice for the world 's most skilled player and three other forwards who would likely be in the starting eleven if they played for joachim loew .
on the other hand , the gauchos have yet to face any truly top opponents and thus remain as enigmatic as coach diego maradona .
recent history is also on germany 's side : the team knocked out argentina at the same stage of the 2006 world cup . but is there any chance of repeating the upset of the albicelestes this time round ?
the key to success would involve exploiting weaknesses at the back .
and they 'll have to pay special attention to the little guy who wears number 10 .
the human playstation bildunterschrift : messi always draws lots of attention any discussion of argentina has to start with fifa world player of the year lionel messi .
at the tender age of 23 , he is already the all-time leading scorer in the champions league for his club barcelona .
arsenal coach arsene wenger called him " unstoppable , " " like a playstation " and " the best player in the world by some distance " after being on the receiving end of one recent barrage .
much has been made of messi 's failure to score yet in the world cup , but no one should be fooled .
the youngster has been drawing two to three markers throughout most matches - in the group stage , greece coach otto rehhagel even assigned a man-to-man marker to do nothing but follow messi around .
that has opened up opportunities for argentina 's strikers , especially gonzalo higuain and carlos tevez .
and after four games , messi already has four assists .
it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .
the trick is to limit his impact somewhat - but even that is going to pose major problems for the german defense . " against germany , i 'm playing double or nothing , " messi told reporters on sunday after argentina had sealed their quarterfinal berth with a 3-1 win over mexico .
the nationalelf has been warned .
midfield balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mascherano is argentina 's heart and soul maradona has five quality midfielders at his disposal , and with the exception of captain javier mascherano , who 's played every minute of the world cup , the coach has been rotating them .
they are a diverse lot .
angel di maria is only 22 years old and is a rising star for portugese club benfica .
juan sebastian veron , on the other hand , is a grizzled 35 year-old veteran who has played for a number of top clubs in europe , including manchester united and chelsea .
what they all have in common , though , are quick feet .
argentina have moved the ball forward faster than any other team at the world cup .
they 're also a reliable defensive unit - which is more than can be said for the gauchos ' back line .
question marks bildunterschrift : demichelis ' concentration has drifted at times if this team has an achilles ' heel , it 's in defense .
center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .
so it will be well worth thomas mueller , mesut oezil and lukas podolski probing for weaknesses at the back .
genius or madman ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear sometimes what maradona has been trying to say undoubtedly the most inscrutable factor for argentina is the man nominally in charge : maradona .
the living legend 's tirade against journalists after argentina 's difficult qualification for the world cup has become a youtube favorite , and his remarks to the press after progressing to the quarterfinals were n't bad either .
" why should i think about germany , " maradona bellowed at reporters after the mexico win .
" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .
have carte blanche to write whatever you want about what i think about germany . "
maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .
but maradona does seem to have his players on his side , and team morale has been good .
and that 's just another reason why argentina is going to be a much , much more difficult adversary for germany than england 's luckless and hapless lot .

it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

net migration to the uk was 142,000 from january to september last year , down from 160,000 in the previous 12-month period .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 28.06.2010 advertisers and street artists swap tactics in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street artists and corporations are fighting over the same public spaces in a fight for attention , ads and street art are doing a switcheroo .
street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

the temporary cap is to precede a permanent limit next year . the british government has announced a temporary cap on the number of skilled non-eu immigrants who are allowed to enter britain , ahead of a permanent cap on numbers to be introduced next april .
the temporary curb will take effect next month , and is to limit the number of non-eu immigrants to just over 24,000 before april 2011 , a fall of five percent on last year .
prime minister david cameron took a tough line on immigration during his election campaign last month , promising reductions .
home secretary theresa may said net immigration had been too high under the previous labour government , and that if left uncontrolled , immigration " was not a good thing " due to the pressure it placed on public services .
" what we have as an aim is indeed to bring immigration down from the hundreds of thousands that it became under labour to the tens of thousands that it used to be .
there are various ways in which we can do that , " she told bbc radio .
" this government believes that britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration , " she said .
may added that the interim limit was necessary to avoid a rush of immigrants ahead of the permanent cap next year .
she said that recent figures showed that migration from eu countries to the uk accounted for around 33 percent of the total , with the rest consisting of non-eu and non-british peoples .
net migration to the uk was 142,000 from january to september last year , down from 160,000 in the previous 12-month period .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 28.06.2010 eu , us sign swift terror finance deal , overcoming privacy worries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swift handles interbank financial communication the european union and the united states have signed a deal allowing the banking data of ordinary europeans to be sent to the us for investigation .
washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .
" after intense confrontation , the eu council has finally come to terms with our demands . "

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .
" after intense confrontation , the eu council has finally come to terms with our demands . "

the temporary cap is to precede a permanent limit next year . the british government has announced a temporary cap on the number of skilled non-eu immigrants who are allowed to enter britain , ahead of a permanent cap on numbers to be introduced next april .
the temporary curb will take effect next month , and is to limit the number of non-eu immigrants to just over 24,000 before april 2011 , a fall of five percent on last year .
prime minister david cameron took a tough line on immigration during his election campaign last month , promising reductions .
home secretary theresa may said net immigration had been too high under the previous labour government , and that if left uncontrolled , immigration " was not a good thing " due to the pressure it placed on public services .
" what we have as an aim is indeed to bring immigration down from the hundreds of thousands that it became under labour to the tens of thousands that it used to be .
there are various ways in which we can do that , " she told bbc radio .
" this government believes that britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration , " she said .
may added that the interim limit was necessary to avoid a rush of immigrants ahead of the permanent cap next year .
she said that recent figures showed that migration from eu countries to the uk accounted for around 33 percent of the total , with the rest consisting of non-eu and non-british peoples .
net migration to the uk was 142,000 from january to september last year , down from 160,000 in the previous 12-month period .

meanwhile , anti g-20 protests continued in the streets of toronto . world leaders at the group of 20 summit on sunday pledged to cut their national deficits in half by 2013 and agreed to let members set levies on their banks , but rejected calls for a worldwide tax on financial transactions .
on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .
“ frankly , the outcome was better than i expected , ” said german chancellor angela merkel .
she said leaders had come up with a formula for debt reduction that would not harm growth , a plan that “ corresponds exactly to our timeline . ”
" our challenges are as diverse as our nations , " said us president barack obama .
" but together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy , and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time . "
" there are a range of policy approaches to this end .
some countries are pursuing a financial levy .
other countries are pursuing different approaches , " leaders said in the summit 's final report , which took negotiators at least 45 hours to draft .
transaction tax rejected however , the report was also seen as a blow to european ambitions as it made no reference to a financial transaction tax , a proposal rejected by a " vast majority " of g-20 leaders " at once , " according to diplomatic sources .

britain , france and germany are all expected to introduce their own bank levies later this year , and the us is also planning a similar move .
merkel had reason to be more upbeat earlier in the day , as she took time out from the conference to watch the second half of the germany-england match with british prime minister david cameron , which germany won 4-1 .
" i am still all excited , " she told reporters .
" i can only say to the german team , go on like this - it was great .
today everything went perfectly in the heads and in the legs . "
clashes continue as world leaders talked and watched the world cup in the convention center , anti g-20 demonstrators continued to protest in numerous locations outside the tightly controlled security perimeter .

" police are continuing to arrest people who engage in criminal activity , " said police spokeswoman jenn geary .
" if they breach security they 're going to be arrested . "
police adopted a more aggressive strategy sunday by going into the crowd to make arrests , compared to saturday when they stood back as protesters torched four police cars and vandalized stores and banks .
a heavy downpour and severe thunderstorm warning discouraged some protesters , though clashes continued into the evening .
despite the reported violence , toronto police said no serious injuries were reported among police , protesters and bystanders .

russia , meanwhile , remains skeptical about kyrgyzstan 's aspirations . opposition leaders said on monday that they were wary of the results of the weekend referendum , which was hailed by the interim government as an overwhelming display of the country 's desire for a new constitution .

" i highly doubt that the central election commission 's data reflects the real picture , as monitors from our party on the ground give conflicting information , " madumarov said .
the former interior minister and head of the ata-zhurt opposition party , omurbek suvanaliyev described the figures as fantasy and accused the interim government of " massive falsification " in the registration of voters .

" today the people of kyrgyzstan are voting for stability in the country and the legality of the authorities , " otunbayeva said .
" we will show the world that kyrgyzstan is united . "
the interim government defiantly pressed ahead with the vote despite deadly clashes between minority uzbeks and majority kyrgyz earlier this month , which sparked fears of a collapse of the country .

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .

martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 28.06.2010 advertisers and street artists swap tactics in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street artists and corporations are fighting over the same public spaces in a fight for attention , ads and street art are doing a switcheroo .
street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

the temporary cap is to precede a permanent limit next year . the british government has announced a temporary cap on the number of skilled non-eu immigrants who are allowed to enter britain , ahead of a permanent cap on numbers to be introduced next april .
the temporary curb will take effect next month , and is to limit the number of non-eu immigrants to just over 24,000 before april 2011 , a fall of five percent on last year .
prime minister david cameron took a tough line on immigration during his election campaign last month , promising reductions .
home secretary theresa may said net immigration had been too high under the previous labour government , and that if left uncontrolled , immigration " was not a good thing " due to the pressure it placed on public services .
" what we have as an aim is indeed to bring immigration down from the hundreds of thousands that it became under labour to the tens of thousands that it used to be .
there are various ways in which we can do that , " she told bbc radio .
" this government believes that britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration , " she said .
may added that the interim limit was necessary to avoid a rush of immigrants ahead of the permanent cap next year .
she said that recent figures showed that migration from eu countries to the uk accounted for around 33 percent of the total , with the rest consisting of non-eu and non-british peoples .
net migration to the uk was 142,000 from january to september last year , down from 160,000 in the previous 12-month period .

for instance , you can provide access to clean drinking water for 50 million people .
or save the lives of 800,000 infants .
or , you can spend that money on a gigantic summit meeting , like the one that took place in canada over the weekend .
the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations - and later of the 20 most important economies - met in toronto .
considering the financial cost of the meeting , the results were weak .
one plan on the table but there is also another way of looking at it : considering how much money has been spent recently on rescuing banks and even entire nations , a billion dollars is n't much at all .
the global financial markets need a new structure - that much is beyond question .
but when it comes to figuring out how top politicians should go about making these changes , the devil is in the details .
the financial world has entire legions of lobbyists out fighting against over-regulation .
economies ca n't function without money , and indeed , regulations ca n't be so tight that they squeeze the life out of the banks .
an economy ca n't function without liquidity .
but banks need to resume their original role - that of service-providers to the economy - not of gamblers who do n't know their limits .
also , they have to be able to go bankrupt without pulling the entire financial system into ruin .
a plan for a new architecture for our global financial system is on the table .
us president barack obama proudly unveiled it in toronto .
in washington , congress is expected to pass the law this week .
the europeans were impressed - and will need to get moving in order to come up with their own plan .
surprises and disappointments the summit was preceded by the rolling thunder of discord ; america versus germany , spending versus austerity . but in the end , reason prevailed .
the ambitious formula : growth through intelligent austerity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme these kinds of conflicts are important .
in the final analysis , the players find themselves on virgin political soil .
no one can come up with the ultimate solution , because every country is faced with different conditions .
thus , the debate has no winners and no losers - and that was the big surprise that came out of toronto .
but the financial crisis pushed other important topics - like climate change , say , or the fight against poverty and hunger - right off the agenda . at this point , even the wealthy nations themselves are admitting that they have n't kept their promises to poorer countries .
maybe that is why more recent promises - like the initiative to fight maternal and infant death , proposed here in toronto , - are somewhat more modest .
it is miserable to see how much money wealthy countries are willing and able to throw around in order to keep their own heads above water .
and that was the big disappointment that came out of toronto .
a new litmus test be that as it may , the g20 nations need to come together .
at some point , the crisis that forced them to come together , will be over .
and the introduction of financial market reforms could divide the group .
the g20 is different from the g8 in that all the countries do n't share the same values .
it sounds positive when china not only loosens its monetary policy ahead of the meeting , but then goes on to advocate sustainable growth during the summit itself .
in any case , the real litmus test for the g20 still lies ahead , since many of the important decisions for a new world financial order were pushed back to the coming summit in south korea .
the big crisis is n't far behind us .
and only in seoul will we be able to look back and gauge the success - or lack thereof - of the toronto summit .

for instance , you can provide access to clean drinking water for 50 million people .
or save the lives of 800,000 infants .
or , you can spend that money on a gigantic summit meeting , like the one that took place in canada over the weekend .
the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations - and later of the 20 most important economies - met in toronto .
considering the financial cost of the meeting , the results were weak .
one plan on the table but there is also another way of looking at it : considering how much money has been spent recently on rescuing banks and even entire nations , a billion dollars is n't much at all .
the global financial markets need a new structure - that much is beyond question .
but when it comes to figuring out how top politicians should go about making these changes , the devil is in the details .
the financial world has entire legions of lobbyists out fighting against over-regulation .
economies ca n't function without money , and indeed , regulations ca n't be so tight that they squeeze the life out of the banks .
an economy ca n't function without liquidity .
but banks need to resume their original role - that of service-providers to the economy - not of gamblers who do n't know their limits .
also , they have to be able to go bankrupt without pulling the entire financial system into ruin .
a plan for a new architecture for our global financial system is on the table .
us president barack obama proudly unveiled it in toronto .
in washington , congress is expected to pass the law this week .
the europeans were impressed - and will need to get moving in order to come up with their own plan .
surprises and disappointments the summit was preceded by the rolling thunder of discord ; america versus germany , spending versus austerity . but in the end , reason prevailed .
the ambitious formula : growth through intelligent austerity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme these kinds of conflicts are important .
in the final analysis , the players find themselves on virgin political soil .
no one can come up with the ultimate solution , because every country is faced with different conditions .
thus , the debate has no winners and no losers - and that was the big surprise that came out of toronto .
but the financial crisis pushed other important topics - like climate change , say , or the fight against poverty and hunger - right off the agenda . at this point , even the wealthy nations themselves are admitting that they have n't kept their promises to poorer countries .
maybe that is why more recent promises - like the initiative to fight maternal and infant death , proposed here in toronto , - are somewhat more modest .
it is miserable to see how much money wealthy countries are willing and able to throw around in order to keep their own heads above water .
and that was the big disappointment that came out of toronto .
a new litmus test be that as it may , the g20 nations need to come together .
at some point , the crisis that forced them to come together , will be over .
and the introduction of financial market reforms could divide the group .
the g20 is different from the g8 in that all the countries do n't share the same values .
it sounds positive when china not only loosens its monetary policy ahead of the meeting , but then goes on to advocate sustainable growth during the summit itself .
in any case , the real litmus test for the g20 still lies ahead , since many of the important decisions for a new world financial order were pushed back to the coming summit in south korea .
the big crisis is n't far behind us .
and only in seoul will we be able to look back and gauge the success - or lack thereof - of the toronto summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 28.06.2010 mueller 's heroics are typical of new ' young germany ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mueller , the man of the match , is 20 years old the german squad that beat england to progress to the quarterfinals is the youngest ever with an average age of 25 .
but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

the temporary cap is to precede a permanent limit next year . the british government has announced a temporary cap on the number of skilled non-eu immigrants who are allowed to enter britain , ahead of a permanent cap on numbers to be introduced next april .
the temporary curb will take effect next month , and is to limit the number of non-eu immigrants to just over 24,000 before april 2011 , a fall of five percent on last year .
prime minister david cameron took a tough line on immigration during his election campaign last month , promising reductions .
home secretary theresa may said net immigration had been too high under the previous labour government , and that if left uncontrolled , immigration " was not a good thing " due to the pressure it placed on public services .
" what we have as an aim is indeed to bring immigration down from the hundreds of thousands that it became under labour to the tens of thousands that it used to be .
there are various ways in which we can do that , " she told bbc radio .
" this government believes that britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration , " she said .
may added that the interim limit was necessary to avoid a rush of immigrants ahead of the permanent cap next year .
she said that recent figures showed that migration from eu countries to the uk accounted for around 33 percent of the total , with the rest consisting of non-eu and non-british peoples .
net migration to the uk was 142,000 from january to september last year , down from 160,000 in the previous 12-month period .

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .

the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .

the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .

if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

argentina are undefeated thus far , and the question is : are they good , very good or world-class ? when germany 's young squad takes to the pitch against argentina on saturday in cape town , they will be forgiven if they 're a bit awe-struck .
lining up on the other side will be a living legend with a short fuse , the consensus choice for the world 's most skilled player and three other forwards who would likely be in the starting eleven if they played for joachim loew .
on the other hand , the gauchos have yet to face any truly top opponents and thus remain as enigmatic as coach diego maradona .
recent history is also on germany 's side : the team knocked out argentina at the same stage of the 2006 world cup . but is there any chance of repeating the upset of the albicelestes this time round ?
the key to success would involve exploiting weaknesses at the back .
and they 'll have to pay special attention to the little guy who wears number 10 .
the human playstation bildunterschrift : messi always draws lots of attention any discussion of argentina has to start with fifa world player of the year lionel messi .
at the tender age of 23 , he is already the all-time leading scorer in the champions league for his club barcelona .
arsenal coach arsene wenger called him " unstoppable , " " like a playstation " and " the best player in the world by some distance " after being on the receiving end of one recent barrage .
much has been made of messi 's failure to score yet in the world cup , but no one should be fooled .
the youngster has been drawing two to three markers throughout most matches - in the group stage , greece coach otto rehhagel even assigned a man-to-man marker to do nothing but follow messi around .
that has opened up opportunities for argentina 's strikers , especially gonzalo higuain and carlos tevez .
and after four games , messi already has four assists .
it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .
the trick is to limit his impact somewhat - but even that is going to pose major problems for the german defense . " against germany , i 'm playing double or nothing , " messi told reporters on sunday after argentina had sealed their quarterfinal berth with a 3-1 win over mexico .
the nationalelf has been warned .
midfield balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mascherano is argentina 's heart and soul maradona has five quality midfielders at his disposal , and with the exception of captain javier mascherano , who 's played every minute of the world cup , the coach has been rotating them .
they are a diverse lot .
angel di maria is only 22 years old and is a rising star for portugese club benfica .
juan sebastian veron , on the other hand , is a grizzled 35 year-old veteran who has played for a number of top clubs in europe , including manchester united and chelsea .
what they all have in common , though , are quick feet .
argentina have moved the ball forward faster than any other team at the world cup .
they 're also a reliable defensive unit - which is more than can be said for the gauchos ' back line .
question marks bildunterschrift : demichelis ' concentration has drifted at times if this team has an achilles ' heel , it 's in defense .
center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .
so it will be well worth thomas mueller , mesut oezil and lukas podolski probing for weaknesses at the back .
genius or madman ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear sometimes what maradona has been trying to say undoubtedly the most inscrutable factor for argentina is the man nominally in charge : maradona .
the living legend 's tirade against journalists after argentina 's difficult qualification for the world cup has become a youtube favorite , and his remarks to the press after progressing to the quarterfinals were n't bad either .
" why should i think about germany , " maradona bellowed at reporters after the mexico win .
" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .
have carte blanche to write whatever you want about what i think about germany . "
maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .
but maradona does seem to have his players on his side , and team morale has been good .
and that 's just another reason why argentina is going to be a much , much more difficult adversary for germany than england 's luckless and hapless lot .

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .
" after intense confrontation , the eu council has finally come to terms with our demands . "

genius or madman ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear sometimes what maradona has been trying to say undoubtedly the most inscrutable factor for argentina is the man nominally in charge : maradona .
the living legend 's tirade against journalists after argentina 's difficult qualification for the world cup has become a youtube favorite , and his remarks to the press after progressing to the quarterfinals were n't bad either .
" why should i think about germany , " maradona bellowed at reporters after the mexico win .
" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .
have carte blanche to write whatever you want about what i think about germany . "
maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .
but maradona does seem to have his players on his side , and team morale has been good .
and that 's just another reason why argentina is going to be a much , much more difficult adversary for germany than england 's luckless and hapless lot .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .
" after intense confrontation , the eu council has finally come to terms with our demands . "

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .

robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .

lining up on the other side will be a living legend with a short fuse , the consensus choice for the world 's most skilled player and three other forwards who would likely be in the starting eleven if they played for joachim loew .
on the other hand , the gauchos have yet to face any truly top opponents and thus remain as enigmatic as coach diego maradona .
recent history is also on germany 's side : the team knocked out argentina at the same stage of the 2006 world cup . but is there any chance of repeating the upset of the albicelestes this time round ?
the key to success would involve exploiting weaknesses at the back .
and they 'll have to pay special attention to the little guy who wears number 10 .
the human playstation bildunterschrift : messi always draws lots of attention any discussion of argentina has to start with fifa world player of the year lionel messi .
at the tender age of 23 , he is already the all-time leading scorer in the champions league for his club barcelona .
arsenal coach arsene wenger called him " unstoppable , " " like a playstation " and " the best player in the world by some distance " after being on the receiving end of one recent barrage .
much has been made of messi 's failure to score yet in the world cup , but no one should be fooled .
the youngster has been drawing two to three markers throughout most matches - in the group stage , greece coach otto rehhagel even assigned a man-to-man marker to do nothing but follow messi around .
that has opened up opportunities for argentina 's strikers , especially gonzalo higuain and carlos tevez .
and after four games , messi already has four assists .
it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .
the trick is to limit his impact somewhat - but even that is going to pose major problems for the german defense . " against germany , i 'm playing double or nothing , " messi told reporters on sunday after argentina had sealed their quarterfinal berth with a 3-1 win over mexico .
the nationalelf has been warned .
midfield balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mascherano is argentina 's heart and soul maradona has five quality midfielders at his disposal , and with the exception of captain javier mascherano , who 's played every minute of the world cup , the coach has been rotating them .
they are a diverse lot .
angel di maria is only 22 years old and is a rising star for portugese club benfica .
juan sebastian veron , on the other hand , is a grizzled 35 year-old veteran who has played for a number of top clubs in europe , including manchester united and chelsea .
what they all have in common , though , are quick feet .
argentina have moved the ball forward faster than any other team at the world cup .
they 're also a reliable defensive unit - which is more than can be said for the gauchos ' back line .
question marks bildunterschrift : demichelis ' concentration has drifted at times if this team has an achilles ' heel , it 's in defense .
center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .
so it will be well worth thomas mueller , mesut oezil and lukas podolski probing for weaknesses at the back .
genius or madman ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear sometimes what maradona has been trying to say undoubtedly the most inscrutable factor for argentina is the man nominally in charge : maradona .
the living legend 's tirade against journalists after argentina 's difficult qualification for the world cup has become a youtube favorite , and his remarks to the press after progressing to the quarterfinals were n't bad either .
" why should i think about germany , " maradona bellowed at reporters after the mexico win .
" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .
have carte blanche to write whatever you want about what i think about germany . "
maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .
but maradona does seem to have his players on his side , and team morale has been good .
and that 's just another reason why argentina is going to be a much , much more difficult adversary for germany than england 's luckless and hapless lot .

center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .
so it will be well worth thomas mueller , mesut oezil and lukas podolski probing for weaknesses at the back .
genius or madman ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear sometimes what maradona has been trying to say undoubtedly the most inscrutable factor for argentina is the man nominally in charge : maradona .
the living legend 's tirade against journalists after argentina 's difficult qualification for the world cup has become a youtube favorite , and his remarks to the press after progressing to the quarterfinals were n't bad either .
" why should i think about germany , " maradona bellowed at reporters after the mexico win .
" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .
have carte blanche to write whatever you want about what i think about germany . "
maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .
but maradona does seem to have his players on his side , and team morale has been good .
and that 's just another reason why argentina is going to be a much , much more difficult adversary for germany than england 's luckless and hapless lot .

it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 28.06.2010 advertisers and street artists swap tactics in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street artists and corporations are fighting over the same public spaces in a fight for attention , ads and street art are doing a switcheroo .
street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 28.06.2010 advertisers and street artists swap tactics in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street artists and corporations are fighting over the same public spaces in a fight for attention , ads and street art are doing a switcheroo .
street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 28.06.2010 eu , us sign swift terror finance deal , overcoming privacy worries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swift handles interbank financial communication the european union and the united states have signed a deal allowing the banking data of ordinary europeans to be sent to the us for investigation .
washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .
" after intense confrontation , the eu council has finally come to terms with our demands . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 28.06.2010 star-studded argentina will put germany to the test in quarterfinals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two biggest names in the cup belong to argentina having dispatched england , the nationalelf now have to face one of the pre-tournament favorites .
argentina are undefeated thus far , and the question is : are they good , very good or world-class ? when germany 's young squad takes to the pitch against argentina on saturday in cape town , they will be forgiven if they 're a bit awe-struck .
lining up on the other side will be a living legend with a short fuse , the consensus choice for the world 's most skilled player and three other forwards who would likely be in the starting eleven if they played for joachim loew .
on the other hand , the gauchos have yet to face any truly top opponents and thus remain as enigmatic as coach diego maradona .
recent history is also on germany 's side : the team knocked out argentina at the same stage of the 2006 world cup . but is there any chance of repeating the upset of the albicelestes this time round ?
the key to success would involve exploiting weaknesses at the back .
and they 'll have to pay special attention to the little guy who wears number 10 .
the human playstation bildunterschrift : messi always draws lots of attention any discussion of argentina has to start with fifa world player of the year lionel messi .
at the tender age of 23 , he is already the all-time leading scorer in the champions league for his club barcelona .
arsenal coach arsene wenger called him " unstoppable , " " like a playstation " and " the best player in the world by some distance " after being on the receiving end of one recent barrage .
much has been made of messi 's failure to score yet in the world cup , but no one should be fooled .
the youngster has been drawing two to three markers throughout most matches - in the group stage , greece coach otto rehhagel even assigned a man-to-man marker to do nothing but follow messi around .
that has opened up opportunities for argentina 's strikers , especially gonzalo higuain and carlos tevez .
and after four games , messi already has four assists .
it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .
the trick is to limit his impact somewhat - but even that is going to pose major problems for the german defense . " against germany , i 'm playing double or nothing , " messi told reporters on sunday after argentina had sealed their quarterfinal berth with a 3-1 win over mexico .
the nationalelf has been warned .
midfield balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mascherano is argentina 's heart and soul maradona has five quality midfielders at his disposal , and with the exception of captain javier mascherano , who 's played every minute of the world cup , the coach has been rotating them .
they are a diverse lot .
angel di maria is only 22 years old and is a rising star for portugese club benfica .
juan sebastian veron , on the other hand , is a grizzled 35 year-old veteran who has played for a number of top clubs in europe , including manchester united and chelsea .
what they all have in common , though , are quick feet .
argentina have moved the ball forward faster than any other team at the world cup .
they 're also a reliable defensive unit - which is more than can be said for the gauchos ' back line .
question marks bildunterschrift : demichelis ' concentration has drifted at times if this team has an achilles ' heel , it 's in defense .
center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .
so it will be well worth thomas mueller , mesut oezil and lukas podolski probing for weaknesses at the back .
genius or madman ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear sometimes what maradona has been trying to say undoubtedly the most inscrutable factor for argentina is the man nominally in charge : maradona .
the living legend 's tirade against journalists after argentina 's difficult qualification for the world cup has become a youtube favorite , and his remarks to the press after progressing to the quarterfinals were n't bad either .
" why should i think about germany , " maradona bellowed at reporters after the mexico win .
" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .
have carte blanche to write whatever you want about what i think about germany . "
maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .
but maradona does seem to have his players on his side , and team morale has been good .
and that 's just another reason why argentina is going to be a much , much more difficult adversary for germany than england 's luckless and hapless lot .

arsenal coach arsene wenger called him " unstoppable , " " like a playstation " and " the best player in the world by some distance " after being on the receiving end of one recent barrage .
much has been made of messi 's failure to score yet in the world cup , but no one should be fooled .
the youngster has been drawing two to three markers throughout most matches - in the group stage , greece coach otto rehhagel even assigned a man-to-man marker to do nothing but follow messi around .

it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .
the trick is to limit his impact somewhat - but even that is going to pose major problems for the german defense . " against germany , i 'm playing double or nothing , " messi told reporters on sunday after argentina had sealed their quarterfinal berth with a 3-1 win over mexico .

center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .

" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .

maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .

that has opened up opportunities for argentina 's strikers , especially gonzalo higuain and carlos tevez .
and after four games , messi already has four assists .
it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .
the trick is to limit his impact somewhat - but even that is going to pose major problems for the german defense . " against germany , i 'm playing double or nothing , " messi told reporters on sunday after argentina had sealed their quarterfinal berth with a 3-1 win over mexico .
the nationalelf has been warned .
midfield balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mascherano is argentina 's heart and soul maradona has five quality midfielders at his disposal , and with the exception of captain javier mascherano , who 's played every minute of the world cup , the coach has been rotating them .
they are a diverse lot .
angel di maria is only 22 years old and is a rising star for portugese club benfica .
juan sebastian veron , on the other hand , is a grizzled 35 year-old veteran who has played for a number of top clubs in europe , including manchester united and chelsea .
what they all have in common , though , are quick feet .
argentina have moved the ball forward faster than any other team at the world cup .
they 're also a reliable defensive unit - which is more than can be said for the gauchos ' back line .
question marks bildunterschrift : demichelis ' concentration has drifted at times if this team has an achilles ' heel , it 's in defense .
center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .
so it will be well worth thomas mueller , mesut oezil and lukas podolski probing for weaknesses at the back .
genius or madman ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear sometimes what maradona has been trying to say undoubtedly the most inscrutable factor for argentina is the man nominally in charge : maradona .
the living legend 's tirade against journalists after argentina 's difficult qualification for the world cup has become a youtube favorite , and his remarks to the press after progressing to the quarterfinals were n't bad either .
" why should i think about germany , " maradona bellowed at reporters after the mexico win .
" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .
have carte blanche to write whatever you want about what i think about germany . "
maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .
but maradona does seem to have his players on his side , and team morale has been good .
and that 's just another reason why argentina is going to be a much , much more difficult adversary for germany than england 's luckless and hapless lot .

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .

the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .

the temporary cap is to precede a permanent limit next year . the british government has announced a temporary cap on the number of skilled non-eu immigrants who are allowed to enter britain , ahead of a permanent cap on numbers to be introduced next april .
the temporary curb will take effect next month , and is to limit the number of non-eu immigrants to just over 24,000 before april 2011 , a fall of five percent on last year .
prime minister david cameron took a tough line on immigration during his election campaign last month , promising reductions .
home secretary theresa may said net immigration had been too high under the previous labour government , and that if left uncontrolled , immigration " was not a good thing " due to the pressure it placed on public services .
" what we have as an aim is indeed to bring immigration down from the hundreds of thousands that it became under labour to the tens of thousands that it used to be .
there are various ways in which we can do that , " she told bbc radio .
" this government believes that britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration , " she said .
may added that the interim limit was necessary to avoid a rush of immigrants ahead of the permanent cap next year .
she said that recent figures showed that migration from eu countries to the uk accounted for around 33 percent of the total , with the rest consisting of non-eu and non-british peoples .
net migration to the uk was 142,000 from january to september last year , down from 160,000 in the previous 12-month period .

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 28.06.2010 opinion : the real test of g20 summit meetings is yet to come großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's henrik boehme says the g20 summit in toronto over the weekend brought both disappointments and surprises - and it left the real value of such meetings to be determined at a later date . you can do a lot with a billion dollars -lrb- 810 million euros -rrb- .
for instance , you can provide access to clean drinking water for 50 million people .
or save the lives of 800,000 infants .
or , you can spend that money on a gigantic summit meeting , like the one that took place in canada over the weekend .
the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations - and later of the 20 most important economies - met in toronto .
considering the financial cost of the meeting , the results were weak .
one plan on the table but there is also another way of looking at it : considering how much money has been spent recently on rescuing banks and even entire nations , a billion dollars is n't much at all .
the global financial markets need a new structure - that much is beyond question .
but when it comes to figuring out how top politicians should go about making these changes , the devil is in the details .
the financial world has entire legions of lobbyists out fighting against over-regulation .
economies ca n't function without money , and indeed , regulations ca n't be so tight that they squeeze the life out of the banks .
an economy ca n't function without liquidity .
but banks need to resume their original role - that of service-providers to the economy - not of gamblers who do n't know their limits .
also , they have to be able to go bankrupt without pulling the entire financial system into ruin .
a plan for a new architecture for our global financial system is on the table .
us president barack obama proudly unveiled it in toronto .
in washington , congress is expected to pass the law this week .
the europeans were impressed - and will need to get moving in order to come up with their own plan .
surprises and disappointments the summit was preceded by the rolling thunder of discord ; america versus germany , spending versus austerity . but in the end , reason prevailed .
the ambitious formula : growth through intelligent austerity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme these kinds of conflicts are important .
in the final analysis , the players find themselves on virgin political soil .
no one can come up with the ultimate solution , because every country is faced with different conditions .
thus , the debate has no winners and no losers - and that was the big surprise that came out of toronto .
but the financial crisis pushed other important topics - like climate change , say , or the fight against poverty and hunger - right off the agenda . at this point , even the wealthy nations themselves are admitting that they have n't kept their promises to poorer countries .
maybe that is why more recent promises - like the initiative to fight maternal and infant death , proposed here in toronto , - are somewhat more modest .
it is miserable to see how much money wealthy countries are willing and able to throw around in order to keep their own heads above water .
and that was the big disappointment that came out of toronto .
a new litmus test be that as it may , the g20 nations need to come together .
at some point , the crisis that forced them to come together , will be over .
and the introduction of financial market reforms could divide the group .
the g20 is different from the g8 in that all the countries do n't share the same values .
it sounds positive when china not only loosens its monetary policy ahead of the meeting , but then goes on to advocate sustainable growth during the summit itself .
in any case , the real litmus test for the g20 still lies ahead , since many of the important decisions for a new world financial order were pushed back to the coming summit in south korea .
the big crisis is n't far behind us .
and only in seoul will we be able to look back and gauge the success - or lack thereof - of the toronto summit .

the temporary cap is to precede a permanent limit next year . the british government has announced a temporary cap on the number of skilled non-eu immigrants who are allowed to enter britain , ahead of a permanent cap on numbers to be introduced next april .
the temporary curb will take effect next month , and is to limit the number of non-eu immigrants to just over 24,000 before april 2011 , a fall of five percent on last year .
prime minister david cameron took a tough line on immigration during his election campaign last month , promising reductions .
home secretary theresa may said net immigration had been too high under the previous labour government , and that if left uncontrolled , immigration " was not a good thing " due to the pressure it placed on public services .
" what we have as an aim is indeed to bring immigration down from the hundreds of thousands that it became under labour to the tens of thousands that it used to be .
there are various ways in which we can do that , " she told bbc radio .
" this government believes that britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration , " she said .
may added that the interim limit was necessary to avoid a rush of immigrants ahead of the permanent cap next year .
she said that recent figures showed that migration from eu countries to the uk accounted for around 33 percent of the total , with the rest consisting of non-eu and non-british peoples .
net migration to the uk was 142,000 from january to september last year , down from 160,000 in the previous 12-month period .

argentina are undefeated thus far , and the question is : are they good , very good or world-class ? when germany 's young squad takes to the pitch against argentina on saturday in cape town , they will be forgiven if they 're a bit awe-struck .
lining up on the other side will be a living legend with a short fuse , the consensus choice for the world 's most skilled player and three other forwards who would likely be in the starting eleven if they played for joachim loew .
on the other hand , the gauchos have yet to face any truly top opponents and thus remain as enigmatic as coach diego maradona .
recent history is also on germany 's side : the team knocked out argentina at the same stage of the 2006 world cup . but is there any chance of repeating the upset of the albicelestes this time round ?
the key to success would involve exploiting weaknesses at the back .

recent history is also on germany 's side : the team knocked out argentina at the same stage of the 2006 world cup . but is there any chance of repeating the upset of the albicelestes this time round ?
the key to success would involve exploiting weaknesses at the back .
and they 'll have to pay special attention to the little guy who wears number 10 .
the human playstation bildunterschrift : messi always draws lots of attention any discussion of argentina has to start with fifa world player of the year lionel messi .
at the tender age of 23 , he is already the all-time leading scorer in the champions league for his club barcelona .
arsenal coach arsene wenger called him " unstoppable , " " like a playstation " and " the best player in the world by some distance " after being on the receiving end of one recent barrage .
much has been made of messi 's failure to score yet in the world cup , but no one should be fooled .
the youngster has been drawing two to three markers throughout most matches - in the group stage , greece coach otto rehhagel even assigned a man-to-man marker to do nothing but follow messi around .
that has opened up opportunities for argentina 's strikers , especially gonzalo higuain and carlos tevez .
and after four games , messi already has four assists .
it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .
the trick is to limit his impact somewhat - but even that is going to pose major problems for the german defense . " against germany , i 'm playing double or nothing , " messi told reporters on sunday after argentina had sealed their quarterfinal berth with a 3-1 win over mexico .
the nationalelf has been warned .
midfield balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mascherano is argentina 's heart and soul maradona has five quality midfielders at his disposal , and with the exception of captain javier mascherano , who 's played every minute of the world cup , the coach has been rotating them .
they are a diverse lot .
angel di maria is only 22 years old and is a rising star for portugese club benfica .
juan sebastian veron , on the other hand , is a grizzled 35 year-old veteran who has played for a number of top clubs in europe , including manchester united and chelsea .
what they all have in common , though , are quick feet .
argentina have moved the ball forward faster than any other team at the world cup .
they 're also a reliable defensive unit - which is more than can be said for the gauchos ' back line .
question marks bildunterschrift : demichelis ' concentration has drifted at times if this team has an achilles ' heel , it 's in defense .
center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .
so it will be well worth thomas mueller , mesut oezil and lukas podolski probing for weaknesses at the back .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear sometimes what maradona has been trying to say undoubtedly the most inscrutable factor for argentina is the man nominally in charge : maradona .
the living legend 's tirade against journalists after argentina 's difficult qualification for the world cup has become a youtube favorite , and his remarks to the press after progressing to the quarterfinals were n't bad either .
" why should i think about germany , " maradona bellowed at reporters after the mexico win .
" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .
have carte blanche to write whatever you want about what i think about germany . "
maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .
but maradona does seem to have his players on his side , and team morale has been good .
and that 's just another reason why argentina is going to be a much , much more difficult adversary for germany than england 's luckless and hapless lot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 28.06.2010 advertisers and street artists swap tactics in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street artists and corporations are fighting over the same public spaces in a fight for attention , ads and street art are doing a switcheroo .
street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .

even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .

" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .

the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .
" after intense confrontation , the eu council has finally come to terms with our demands . "

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 28.06.2010 advertisers and street artists swap tactics in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street artists and corporations are fighting over the same public spaces in a fight for attention , ads and street art are doing a switcheroo .
street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 28.06.2010 advertisers and street artists swap tactics in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street artists and corporations are fighting over the same public spaces in a fight for attention , ads and street art are doing a switcheroo .
street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .

robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 28.06.2010 advertisers and street artists swap tactics in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street artists and corporations are fighting over the same public spaces in a fight for attention , ads and street art are doing a switcheroo .
street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .
" after intense confrontation , the eu council has finally come to terms with our demands . "

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

however , mutual suspicion and a lack of employment prospects threaten to break the peace . the atmosphere is pleasant and peaceful at this market in south urumqi .
uighur traders sell anything members of their community might need – melons and t-shirts for example .
a jade trader from northern xinjiang , called daot * says there is a lot of mutual distrust . many uighurs were arrested arbitrarily last year .
people are constantly asked to show their papers , even today . bildunterschrift : over 1,400 people were arrested in the aftermath of bloody riots daot says that all uighurs are considered by the authorities as potential rioters .
he is angry that he has fallen prey to this prejudice : " i came home one day and there was nothing left .
i have no idea who took my things . " patrol teams and army trucks in the run up to the anniversary of the riots , men in uniform , carrying sticks , have been patrolling the streets .
army trucks have been blaring out slogans about ethnic harmony .
daot is sad that the patrol teams include uighurs .
this means that members of the same community can not even trust each other , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authorities want uighur children to lean chinese better some han chinese also wonder whether money alone will be able to appease the tense relations with the uighurs . " in the current situation , we have to face it , " says zang fuchong , a student " first we need interaction , we need a common language .
if we do not interact , we can not understand each other .
if we do not understand many things , this will create misunderstandings .
because our customs are different in many fields , our lifestyle and also some religious beliefs . " a good grasp of chinese is imperative to aid interaction and understanding , the authorities not only want to boost economic aid but to introduce more language courses so that the uighurs ’ grasp of chinese improves . " the chinese say we need more workers but when our people go for a job you have to speak chinese , " says memet , who works as a guard in a bank in another city in xinjiang , north of urumqi . " if you don ’ t know chinese , there ’ s no way . " memet speaks good chinese but most of his relatives do not .
most of them are unemployed .
they live in the southern part of the city like the other uighurs , in houses made of mud and grass , where there is no running water or electricity .
there are no han chinese here and nobody to practice chinese with . many barriers and little hope one employment option is to set up a stall on a market but memet says even this is not easy because " the city officials tell us to go and if you do they take everything , they chase you away , and do n't let you sell your things on the market .
if they catch you , you get fined . " he says the chinese just want to drive the uighurs into the ground .
he tells the story of his niece who speaks perfect chinese and english and has a tourism management diploma .
after being rejected by all the hotels in urumqi because she was a uighur , she now sells ice cream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police squads patrol the streets of urumqi after the riots last year memet is bitter and has few expectations from the politicians : " a new secretary replaced xinjiang party secretary wang lequan .
he has said many good things about xinjiang .
but who knows what will happen tomorrow , the day after or next year ? " observers say that if there is not more exchange and attempts at mutual understanding , new riots could easily break out again . author : ye zhiliang -lrb- act -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein * none of the names in this article are real send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for instance , you can provide access to clean drinking water for 50 million people .
or save the lives of 800,000 infants .
or , you can spend that money on a gigantic summit meeting , like the one that took place in canada over the weekend .
the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations - and later of the 20 most important economies - met in toronto .
considering the financial cost of the meeting , the results were weak .
one plan on the table but there is also another way of looking at it : considering how much money has been spent recently on rescuing banks and even entire nations , a billion dollars is n't much at all .
the global financial markets need a new structure - that much is beyond question .
but when it comes to figuring out how top politicians should go about making these changes , the devil is in the details .
the financial world has entire legions of lobbyists out fighting against over-regulation .
economies ca n't function without money , and indeed , regulations ca n't be so tight that they squeeze the life out of the banks .
an economy ca n't function without liquidity .
but banks need to resume their original role - that of service-providers to the economy - not of gamblers who do n't know their limits .
also , they have to be able to go bankrupt without pulling the entire financial system into ruin .
a plan for a new architecture for our global financial system is on the table .
us president barack obama proudly unveiled it in toronto .
in washington , congress is expected to pass the law this week .
the europeans were impressed - and will need to get moving in order to come up with their own plan .
surprises and disappointments the summit was preceded by the rolling thunder of discord ; america versus germany , spending versus austerity . but in the end , reason prevailed .
the ambitious formula : growth through intelligent austerity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme these kinds of conflicts are important .
in the final analysis , the players find themselves on virgin political soil .
no one can come up with the ultimate solution , because every country is faced with different conditions .
thus , the debate has no winners and no losers - and that was the big surprise that came out of toronto .
but the financial crisis pushed other important topics - like climate change , say , or the fight against poverty and hunger - right off the agenda . at this point , even the wealthy nations themselves are admitting that they have n't kept their promises to poorer countries .
maybe that is why more recent promises - like the initiative to fight maternal and infant death , proposed here in toronto , - are somewhat more modest .
it is miserable to see how much money wealthy countries are willing and able to throw around in order to keep their own heads above water .
and that was the big disappointment that came out of toronto .
a new litmus test be that as it may , the g20 nations need to come together .
at some point , the crisis that forced them to come together , will be over .
and the introduction of financial market reforms could divide the group .
the g20 is different from the g8 in that all the countries do n't share the same values .
it sounds positive when china not only loosens its monetary policy ahead of the meeting , but then goes on to advocate sustainable growth during the summit itself .
in any case , the real litmus test for the g20 still lies ahead , since many of the important decisions for a new world financial order were pushed back to the coming summit in south korea .
the big crisis is n't far behind us .
and only in seoul will we be able to look back and gauge the success - or lack thereof - of the toronto summit .

russia , meanwhile , remains skeptical about kyrgyzstan 's aspirations . opposition leaders said on monday that they were wary of the results of the weekend referendum , which was hailed by the interim government as an overwhelming display of the country 's desire for a new constitution .
adakhan madumarov , leader of the batun kyrgyzstan party , said the figures were " impossibly high " given the ongoing fallout from deadly ethnic riots that rocked the south of the country earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election commission said turnout was at 69 percent kyrgyzstan 's central election commission said that over 90 percent of voters had approved the plan to make the country a parliamentary republic .
at this point , over 95 percent of districts in kyrgyzstan have reported their results , with voter turnout at just under 70 percent .
" i highly doubt that the central election commission 's data reflects the real picture , as monitors from our party on the ground give conflicting information , " madumarov said .
the former interior minister and head of the ata-zhurt opposition party , omurbek suvanaliyev described the figures as fantasy and accused the interim government of " massive falsification " in the registration of voters .
' overwhelming success ' interim kyrgyz leader roza otunbayeva said the referendum on sunday was an overwhelming success , adding that it had taken place without incident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otunbayeva , center , will stay in power until 2011 " the new constitution has been adopted , despite the savage attacks of its opponents , " otunbayeva told a news conference in the capital , bishkek .
otunbayeva remained convinced that the divisions in the country would not get in the way of her interim government 's plans for reform .
" today the people of kyrgyzstan are voting for stability in the country and the legality of the authorities , " otunbayeva said .
" we will show the world that kyrgyzstan is united . "
the interim government defiantly pressed ahead with the vote despite deadly clashes between minority uzbeks and majority kyrgyz earlier this month , which sparked fears of a collapse of the country .
medvedev skeptical russian president dmitri medvedev , speaking after the g20 summit in toronto , expressed doubt as to whether the country was ready for a parliamentary democracy - or even whether kyrgyz authorities could impose order at present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev says kyrgyzstan is too unstabile for democracy " in its current state , there are a host of scenarios for kyrgyzstan , including the most unpleasant scenario - the collapse of the state , " medvedev said . at least 294 people were killed this month in violence between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan , a former soviet republic which hosts us and russian military air bases and shares a border with china . author : gabriel borrud -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

meanwhile , anti g-20 protests continued in the streets of toronto . world leaders at the group of 20 summit on sunday pledged to cut their national deficits in half by 2013 and agreed to let members set levies on their banks , but rejected calls for a worldwide tax on financial transactions .
on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .
“ frankly , the outcome was better than i expected , ” said german chancellor angela merkel .
she said leaders had come up with a formula for debt reduction that would not harm growth , a plan that “ corresponds exactly to our timeline . ”
" our challenges are as diverse as our nations , " said us president barack obama .
" but together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy , and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time . "
" there are a range of policy approaches to this end .
some countries are pursuing a financial levy .
other countries are pursuing different approaches , " leaders said in the summit 's final report , which took negotiators at least 45 hours to draft .
transaction tax rejected however , the report was also seen as a blow to european ambitions as it made no reference to a financial transaction tax , a proposal rejected by a " vast majority " of g-20 leaders " at once , " according to diplomatic sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron , right , merkel took time out to watch the world cup merkel , who along with the leaders of britain and france had pushed hard for worldwide support of the tax , admitted that the outcome was less than she had hoped for .
britain , france and germany are all expected to introduce their own bank levies later this year , and the us is also planning a similar move .
merkel had reason to be more upbeat earlier in the day , as she took time out from the conference to watch the second half of the germany-england match with british prime minister david cameron , which germany won 4-1 .
" i am still all excited , " she told reporters .
" i can only say to the german team , go on like this - it was great .
today everything went perfectly in the heads and in the legs . "
clashes continue as world leaders talked and watched the world cup in the convention center , anti g-20 demonstrators continued to protest in numerous locations outside the tightly controlled security perimeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continued on sunday at least 600 protesters had been arrested by late afternoon , as standoffs saw police in full riot gear firing tear gas for the second straight day .
" police are continuing to arrest people who engage in criminal activity , " said police spokeswoman jenn geary .
" if they breach security they 're going to be arrested . "
police adopted a more aggressive strategy sunday by going into the crowd to make arrests , compared to saturday when they stood back as protesters torched four police cars and vandalized stores and banks .
a heavy downpour and severe thunderstorm warning discouraged some protesters , though clashes continued into the evening .
despite the reported violence , toronto police said no serious injuries were reported among police , protesters and bystanders .

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us .

michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "

meanwhile , anti g-20 protests continued in the streets of toronto . world leaders at the group of 20 summit on sunday pledged to cut their national deficits in half by 2013 and agreed to let members set levies on their banks , but rejected calls for a worldwide tax on financial transactions .
on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .
“ frankly , the outcome was better than i expected , ” said german chancellor angela merkel .
she said leaders had come up with a formula for debt reduction that would not harm growth , a plan that “ corresponds exactly to our timeline . ”
" our challenges are as diverse as our nations , " said us president barack obama .
" but together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy , and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time . "
" there are a range of policy approaches to this end .
some countries are pursuing a financial levy .
other countries are pursuing different approaches , " leaders said in the summit 's final report , which took negotiators at least 45 hours to draft .
transaction tax rejected however , the report was also seen as a blow to european ambitions as it made no reference to a financial transaction tax , a proposal rejected by a " vast majority " of g-20 leaders " at once , " according to diplomatic sources .

britain , france and germany are all expected to introduce their own bank levies later this year , and the us is also planning a similar move .
merkel had reason to be more upbeat earlier in the day , as she took time out from the conference to watch the second half of the germany-england match with british prime minister david cameron , which germany won 4-1 .
" i am still all excited , " she told reporters .
" i can only say to the german team , go on like this - it was great .
today everything went perfectly in the heads and in the legs . "
clashes continue as world leaders talked and watched the world cup in the convention center , anti g-20 demonstrators continued to protest in numerous locations outside the tightly controlled security perimeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continued on sunday at least 600 protesters had been arrested by late afternoon , as standoffs saw police in full riot gear firing tear gas for the second straight day .
" police are continuing to arrest people who engage in criminal activity , " said police spokeswoman jenn geary .
" if they breach security they 're going to be arrested . "
police adopted a more aggressive strategy sunday by going into the crowd to make arrests , compared to saturday when they stood back as protesters torched four police cars and vandalized stores and banks .
a heavy downpour and severe thunderstorm warning discouraged some protesters , though clashes continued into the evening .
despite the reported violence , toronto police said no serious injuries were reported among police , protesters and bystanders .

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .
" after intense confrontation , the eu council has finally come to terms with our demands . "

argentina are undefeated thus far , and the question is : are they good , very good or world-class ? when germany 's young squad takes to the pitch against argentina on saturday in cape town , they will be forgiven if they 're a bit awe-struck .
lining up on the other side will be a living legend with a short fuse , the consensus choice for the world 's most skilled player and three other forwards who would likely be in the starting eleven if they played for joachim loew .
on the other hand , the gauchos have yet to face any truly top opponents and thus remain as enigmatic as coach diego maradona .
recent history is also on germany 's side : the team knocked out argentina at the same stage of the 2006 world cup . but is there any chance of repeating the upset of the albicelestes this time round ?
the key to success would involve exploiting weaknesses at the back .
and they 'll have to pay special attention to the little guy who wears number 10 .
the human playstation bildunterschrift : messi always draws lots of attention any discussion of argentina has to start with fifa world player of the year lionel messi .
at the tender age of 23 , he is already the all-time leading scorer in the champions league for his club barcelona .
arsenal coach arsene wenger called him " unstoppable , " " like a playstation " and " the best player in the world by some distance " after being on the receiving end of one recent barrage .
much has been made of messi 's failure to score yet in the world cup , but no one should be fooled .
the youngster has been drawing two to three markers throughout most matches - in the group stage , greece coach otto rehhagel even assigned a man-to-man marker to do nothing but follow messi around .
that has opened up opportunities for argentina 's strikers , especially gonzalo higuain and carlos tevez .
and after four games , messi already has four assists .
it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .
the trick is to limit his impact somewhat - but even that is going to pose major problems for the german defense . " against germany , i 'm playing double or nothing , " messi told reporters on sunday after argentina had sealed their quarterfinal berth with a 3-1 win over mexico .
the nationalelf has been warned .
midfield balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mascherano is argentina 's heart and soul maradona has five quality midfielders at his disposal , and with the exception of captain javier mascherano , who 's played every minute of the world cup , the coach has been rotating them .
they are a diverse lot .
angel di maria is only 22 years old and is a rising star for portugese club benfica .
juan sebastian veron , on the other hand , is a grizzled 35 year-old veteran who has played for a number of top clubs in europe , including manchester united and chelsea .
what they all have in common , though , are quick feet .
argentina have moved the ball forward faster than any other team at the world cup .
they 're also a reliable defensive unit - which is more than can be said for the gauchos ' back line .
question marks bildunterschrift : demichelis ' concentration has drifted at times if this team has an achilles ' heel , it 's in defense .
center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .
so it will be well worth thomas mueller , mesut oezil and lukas podolski probing for weaknesses at the back .
genius or madman ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear sometimes what maradona has been trying to say undoubtedly the most inscrutable factor for argentina is the man nominally in charge : maradona .
the living legend 's tirade against journalists after argentina 's difficult qualification for the world cup has become a youtube favorite , and his remarks to the press after progressing to the quarterfinals were n't bad either .
" why should i think about germany , " maradona bellowed at reporters after the mexico win .
" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .
have carte blanche to write whatever you want about what i think about germany . "
maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .
but maradona does seem to have his players on his side , and team morale has been good .
and that 's just another reason why argentina is going to be a much , much more difficult adversary for germany than england 's luckless and hapless lot .

but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .

street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 28.06.2010 race for knowledge spurs physics research at cern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc has been producing collisions since march the large hadron collider is coming late to the party and has a lot to prove in the particle physics community .
it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

necas will lead a center-right coalition that plans to rein in the country 's debt . one month after parliamentary elections , czech president vaclav klaus has named petr necas as the country 's new president .
" i am convinced the government is in the right hands .
i believe you will manage to put a cabinet together in a short time , " klaus told necas in the capital , prague on monday .
the appointment brings the czech republic one step closer to formation of a new center-right government .
necas , 45 , heads the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which emerged as the strongest party from the may election . it is now in coalition talks with the conservative top 09 and the populist public affairs party .
necas said he aimed to complete the coalition deal by july 7 and have the cabinet in place by the middle of july .
once the government is appointed , it has 30 days to pass a confidence vote in the parliament 's lower house .
the new cabinet is expected to take measures aimed at halting the growth of debt , fighting corruption , supporting the economy and boosting the rule of law .
the new government is to replace a caretaker government led by jan fischer , which has ruled the czech republic for the past 14 months .

necas will lead a center-right coalition that plans to rein in the country 's debt . one month after parliamentary elections , czech president vaclav klaus has named petr necas as the country 's new president .
" i am convinced the government is in the right hands .
i believe you will manage to put a cabinet together in a short time , " klaus told necas in the capital , prague on monday .
the appointment brings the czech republic one step closer to formation of a new center-right government .
necas , 45 , heads the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which emerged as the strongest party from the may election . it is now in coalition talks with the conservative top 09 and the populist public affairs party .
necas said he aimed to complete the coalition deal by july 7 and have the cabinet in place by the middle of july .
once the government is appointed , it has 30 days to pass a confidence vote in the parliament 's lower house .
the new cabinet is expected to take measures aimed at halting the growth of debt , fighting corruption , supporting the economy and boosting the rule of law .
the new government is to replace a caretaker government led by jan fischer , which has ruled the czech republic for the past 14 months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 28.06.2010 race for knowledge spurs physics research at cern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc has been producing collisions since march the large hadron collider is coming late to the party and has a lot to prove in the particle physics community .
it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 28.06.2010 britain takes first step in cutting non-eu immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk government says immigration is straining services the british government has unveiled a series of measures to gradually cut the number of skilled immigrants entering the uk .
the temporary cap is to precede a permanent limit next year . the british government has announced a temporary cap on the number of skilled non-eu immigrants who are allowed to enter britain , ahead of a permanent cap on numbers to be introduced next april .
the temporary curb will take effect next month , and is to limit the number of non-eu immigrants to just over 24,000 before april 2011 , a fall of five percent on last year .
prime minister david cameron took a tough line on immigration during his election campaign last month , promising reductions .
home secretary theresa may said net immigration had been too high under the previous labour government , and that if left uncontrolled , immigration " was not a good thing " due to the pressure it placed on public services .
" what we have as an aim is indeed to bring immigration down from the hundreds of thousands that it became under labour to the tens of thousands that it used to be .
there are various ways in which we can do that , " she told bbc radio .
" this government believes that britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration , " she said .
may added that the interim limit was necessary to avoid a rush of immigrants ahead of the permanent cap next year .

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .
" after intense confrontation , the eu council has finally come to terms with our demands . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de advertising -pipe- 28.06.2010 advertisers and street artists swap tactics in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street artists and corporations are fighting over the same public spaces in a fight for attention , ads and street art are doing a switcheroo .
street art is imitating sleek corporate campaigns , while ads are now using graffiti-style maneuvers to promote products - sometimes illegally . something is not right with this ipad poster in a berlin subway .
above the words " easter celebration , " a topless blonde dons a risque bunny suit , legs spread wide .
above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .
" after intense confrontation , the eu council has finally come to terms with our demands . "

washington hopes the agreement will help it track terrorist financing . the european union and the us on monday signed a revised agreement on sharing banking data to investigate suspected terrorist financing , moving the long-running negotiations over the deal a step closer to completion .
under the revised deal , an eu official would be posted in the us treasury in washington to scrutinize the transfer of the european banking data to investigators .
information requests are also to be " tailored as narrowly as possible " and will be checked by europol , the eu 's police coordination agency .
the agreement still needs the green light from the european parliament , which in february rejected an earlier proposal for us access to the so-called swift database - a european consortium which records financial transactions .
eu lawmakers had expressed concerns over a lack of privacy guarantees in the original deal , such as the fact that swift technology does not allow for suspicious transactions to be singled out from bulk data , meaning that the financial information of innocent eu citizens could be transferred and stored in the us for up to five years .
to overcome this problem , european governments and the european commission , which is formally in charge of the talks on the eu side , agreed to set up a swift-data-extraction process in europe , so us authorities would no longer receive information in bulk .
compromise found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rubalcaba said the deal addressed lawmakers ' concerns alfredo perez rubalcaba , spanish interior minister and representative of the eu 's rotating presidency , said on the sidelines of the signing ceremony in brussels that the agreement reflected " the concerns of the european parliament , its concerns about transparency , data protection and cooperation with the us . "
michael dodman , a diplomat who signed the agreement on behalf of the us , said eu representatives " were strong and tough negotiators .
" this is a very , very strong agreement .
we are very proud of it , " he said .
" it is very important to the security of the united states and europe , " adding that the data sharing deal would close a " security gap . "
cecilia malmstroem , the eu commissioner for home affairs , said she was " quite optimistic " that the european parliament would back the new deal next week , allowing it to come into force by as early as august 1 .
martin schulz , the head of the socialists and democrats in the eu parliament , indicated monday that eu lawmakers would accept the revised data sharing deal .
" it is the duty of the eu and the us to cooperate in protecting citizens from terrorism , but citizens have also the right to be protected against excessive state intrusion into their lives and potential mistakes , " schulz said in a statement .

i believe you will manage to put a cabinet together in a short time , " klaus told necas in the capital , prague on monday .
the appointment brings the czech republic one step closer to formation of a new center-right government .
necas , 45 , heads the civic democratic party -lrb- ods -rrb- , which emerged as the strongest party from the may election . it is now in coalition talks with the conservative top 09 and the populist public affairs party .
necas said he aimed to complete the coalition deal by july 7 and have the cabinet in place by the middle of july .
once the government is appointed , it has 30 days to pass a confidence vote in the parliament 's lower house .
the new cabinet is expected to take measures aimed at halting the growth of debt , fighting corruption , supporting the economy and boosting the rule of law .
the new government is to replace a caretaker government led by jan fischer , which has ruled the czech republic for the past 14 months .

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

the world 's top-ranked team now faces the netherlands in the quarterfinals .
the selecao got off to a slow start , finding it hard to make passes stick .
it wasn ’ t until the 34th minute that brazil found a breakthrough .
after winning a corner on the right , maicon swung the ball into the box to find the head of defender juan , who rose highest to produce an unstoppable header that flew in just under the crossbar .
three minutes later , brazil scored their second with a swift counter-attacking maneuver down the left flank .
robinho squared the ball to kaka , who received it just outside the box and fed it , via a short through-ball , to luis fabiano , who rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net .
both chile and brazil got the second half underway at a much swifter pace than the first .
it took only 14 minutes for dunga ’ s men to find a third goal through robinho , who received the ball on the edge of the penalty area from ramires after the midfielder brought it upfield .
robinho hit a powerful , yet well-placed shot to beat chilean keeper claudio bravo high and to his right .
dutch dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch closed the match up in the second half in monday 's afternoon knockout game , the netherlands defeated slovakia 2-1 at moses mabhida stadium in durban .
fit-again winger arjen robben bagged the first goal for the dutch with a stunning strike from the edge of the goal box in the 18th minute .
slovakia were hit on counter-attack when nigel de jong hit a long ball upfield to robben , who charged towards the box on the right , turned infield , and fired a low shot just inside the near post , beating out-stretched slovak goalie jan mucha .
robben , who plays his club football with bayern munich in germany , came into the starting line-up in place of injured midfielder rafael van der vaart , who has complained of a calf problem in recent days .
the slovaks came alive midway through the second half , but the dutch absorbed the pressure and went on to close out the game in the 83rd minute thanks to a neat finish from wesley sneijder .
after a quickly taken free kick from the halfway line , dirk kuyt beat an onrushing mucha to the ball and unselfishly cut it back for sneijder , who coolly slotted home .
slovakia were awarded a consolation penalty deep in injury time when martin jakubko was brought down in the box by stekelenburg .
with the last kick of the game , vittek sent stekelenburg the wrong way , passing the ball into the bottom left corner of the goal .

however , mutual suspicion and a lack of employment prospects threaten to break the peace . the atmosphere is pleasant and peaceful at this market in south urumqi .
uighur traders sell anything members of their community might need – melons and t-shirts for example .
a jade trader from northern xinjiang , called daot * says there is a lot of mutual distrust . many uighurs were arrested arbitrarily last year .
people are constantly asked to show their papers , even today . bildunterschrift : over 1,400 people were arrested in the aftermath of bloody riots daot says that all uighurs are considered by the authorities as potential rioters .
he is angry that he has fallen prey to this prejudice : " i came home one day and there was nothing left .
i have no idea who took my things . " patrol teams and army trucks in the run up to the anniversary of the riots , men in uniform , carrying sticks , have been patrolling the streets .
army trucks have been blaring out slogans about ethnic harmony .
daot is sad that the patrol teams include uighurs .
this means that members of the same community can not even trust each other , he says . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the authorities want uighur children to lean chinese better some han chinese also wonder whether money alone will be able to appease the tense relations with the uighurs . " in the current situation , we have to face it , " says zang fuchong , a student " first we need interaction , we need a common language .
if we do not interact , we can not understand each other .
if we do not understand many things , this will create misunderstandings .
because our customs are different in many fields , our lifestyle and also some religious beliefs . " a good grasp of chinese is imperative to aid interaction and understanding , the authorities not only want to boost economic aid but to introduce more language courses so that the uighurs ’ grasp of chinese improves . " the chinese say we need more workers but when our people go for a job you have to speak chinese , " says memet , who works as a guard in a bank in another city in xinjiang , north of urumqi . " if you don ’ t know chinese , there ’ s no way . " memet speaks good chinese but most of his relatives do not .
most of them are unemployed .
they live in the southern part of the city like the other uighurs , in houses made of mud and grass , where there is no running water or electricity .
there are no han chinese here and nobody to practice chinese with . many barriers and little hope one employment option is to set up a stall on a market but memet says even this is not easy because " the city officials tell us to go and if you do they take everything , they chase you away , and do n't let you sell your things on the market .
if they catch you , you get fined . " he says the chinese just want to drive the uighurs into the ground .
he tells the story of his niece who speaks perfect chinese and english and has a tourism management diploma .
after being rejected by all the hotels in urumqi because she was a uighur , she now sells ice cream . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police squads patrol the streets of urumqi after the riots last year memet is bitter and has few expectations from the politicians : " a new secretary replaced xinjiang party secretary wang lequan .
he has said many good things about xinjiang .
but who knows what will happen tomorrow , the day after or next year ? " observers say that if there is not more exchange and attempts at mutual understanding , new riots could easily break out again . author : ye zhiliang -lrb- act -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein * none of the names in this article are real send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for instance , you can provide access to clean drinking water for 50 million people .
or save the lives of 800,000 infants .
or , you can spend that money on a gigantic summit meeting , like the one that took place in canada over the weekend .
the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations - and later of the 20 most important economies - met in toronto .
considering the financial cost of the meeting , the results were weak .
one plan on the table but there is also another way of looking at it : considering how much money has been spent recently on rescuing banks and even entire nations , a billion dollars is n't much at all .
the global financial markets need a new structure - that much is beyond question .
but when it comes to figuring out how top politicians should go about making these changes , the devil is in the details .
the financial world has entire legions of lobbyists out fighting against over-regulation .
economies ca n't function without money , and indeed , regulations ca n't be so tight that they squeeze the life out of the banks .
an economy ca n't function without liquidity .
but banks need to resume their original role - that of service-providers to the economy - not of gamblers who do n't know their limits .
also , they have to be able to go bankrupt without pulling the entire financial system into ruin .
a plan for a new architecture for our global financial system is on the table .
us president barack obama proudly unveiled it in toronto .
in washington , congress is expected to pass the law this week .
the europeans were impressed - and will need to get moving in order to come up with their own plan .
surprises and disappointments the summit was preceded by the rolling thunder of discord ; america versus germany , spending versus austerity . but in the end , reason prevailed .
the ambitious formula : growth through intelligent austerity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme these kinds of conflicts are important .
in the final analysis , the players find themselves on virgin political soil .
no one can come up with the ultimate solution , because every country is faced with different conditions .
thus , the debate has no winners and no losers - and that was the big surprise that came out of toronto .
but the financial crisis pushed other important topics - like climate change , say , or the fight against poverty and hunger - right off the agenda . at this point , even the wealthy nations themselves are admitting that they have n't kept their promises to poorer countries .
maybe that is why more recent promises - like the initiative to fight maternal and infant death , proposed here in toronto , - are somewhat more modest .
it is miserable to see how much money wealthy countries are willing and able to throw around in order to keep their own heads above water .
and that was the big disappointment that came out of toronto .
a new litmus test be that as it may , the g20 nations need to come together .
at some point , the crisis that forced them to come together , will be over .

the g20 is different from the g8 in that all the countries do n't share the same values .
it sounds positive when china not only loosens its monetary policy ahead of the meeting , but then goes on to advocate sustainable growth during the summit itself .
in any case , the real litmus test for the g20 still lies ahead , since many of the important decisions for a new world financial order were pushed back to the coming summit in south korea .

meanwhile , anti g-20 protests continued in the streets of toronto . world leaders at the group of 20 summit on sunday pledged to cut their national deficits in half by 2013 and agreed to let members set levies on their banks , but rejected calls for a worldwide tax on financial transactions .
on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .
“ frankly , the outcome was better than i expected , ” said german chancellor angela merkel .
she said leaders had come up with a formula for debt reduction that would not harm growth , a plan that “ corresponds exactly to our timeline . ”
" our challenges are as diverse as our nations , " said us president barack obama .
" but together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy , and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time . "
" there are a range of policy approaches to this end .
some countries are pursuing a financial levy .
other countries are pursuing different approaches , " leaders said in the summit 's final report , which took negotiators at least 45 hours to draft .
transaction tax rejected however , the report was also seen as a blow to european ambitions as it made no reference to a financial transaction tax , a proposal rejected by a " vast majority " of g-20 leaders " at once , " according to diplomatic sources .

britain , france and germany are all expected to introduce their own bank levies later this year , and the us is also planning a similar move .
merkel had reason to be more upbeat earlier in the day , as she took time out from the conference to watch the second half of the germany-england match with british prime minister david cameron , which germany won 4-1 .
" i am still all excited , " she told reporters .
" i can only say to the german team , go on like this - it was great .
today everything went perfectly in the heads and in the legs . "
clashes continue as world leaders talked and watched the world cup in the convention center , anti g-20 demonstrators continued to protest in numerous locations outside the tightly controlled security perimeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continued on sunday at least 600 protesters had been arrested by late afternoon , as standoffs saw police in full riot gear firing tear gas for the second straight day .
" police are continuing to arrest people who engage in criminal activity , " said police spokeswoman jenn geary .
" if they breach security they 're going to be arrested . "
police adopted a more aggressive strategy sunday by going into the crowd to make arrests , compared to saturday when they stood back as protesters torched four police cars and vandalized stores and banks .
a heavy downpour and severe thunderstorm warning discouraged some protesters , though clashes continued into the evening .
despite the reported violence , toronto police said no serious injuries were reported among police , protesters and bystanders .

meanwhile , anti g-20 protests continued in the streets of toronto . world leaders at the group of 20 summit on sunday pledged to cut their national deficits in half by 2013 and agreed to let members set levies on their banks , but rejected calls for a worldwide tax on financial transactions .
on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .
“ frankly , the outcome was better than i expected , ” said german chancellor angela merkel .
she said leaders had come up with a formula for debt reduction that would not harm growth , a plan that “ corresponds exactly to our timeline . ”
" our challenges are as diverse as our nations , " said us president barack obama .
" but together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy , and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time . "
" there are a range of policy approaches to this end .
some countries are pursuing a financial levy .
other countries are pursuing different approaches , " leaders said in the summit 's final report , which took negotiators at least 45 hours to draft .
transaction tax rejected however , the report was also seen as a blow to european ambitions as it made no reference to a financial transaction tax , a proposal rejected by a " vast majority " of g-20 leaders " at once , " according to diplomatic sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron , right , merkel took time out to watch the world cup merkel , who along with the leaders of britain and france had pushed hard for worldwide support of the tax , admitted that the outcome was less than she had hoped for .
britain , france and germany are all expected to introduce their own bank levies later this year , and the us is also planning a similar move .
merkel had reason to be more upbeat earlier in the day , as she took time out from the conference to watch the second half of the germany-england match with british prime minister david cameron , which germany won 4-1 .
" i am still all excited , " she told reporters .
" i can only say to the german team , go on like this - it was great .
today everything went perfectly in the heads and in the legs . "
clashes continue as world leaders talked and watched the world cup in the convention center , anti g-20 demonstrators continued to protest in numerous locations outside the tightly controlled security perimeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continued on sunday at least 600 protesters had been arrested by late afternoon , as standoffs saw police in full riot gear firing tear gas for the second straight day .
" police are continuing to arrest people who engage in criminal activity , " said police spokeswoman jenn geary .
" if they breach security they 're going to be arrested . "
police adopted a more aggressive strategy sunday by going into the crowd to make arrests , compared to saturday when they stood back as protesters torched four police cars and vandalized stores and banks .
a heavy downpour and severe thunderstorm warning discouraged some protesters , though clashes continued into the evening .
despite the reported violence , toronto police said no serious injuries were reported among police , protesters and bystanders .

the temporary cap is to precede a permanent limit next year . the british government has announced a temporary cap on the number of skilled non-eu immigrants who are allowed to enter britain , ahead of a permanent cap on numbers to be introduced next april .
the temporary curb will take effect next month , and is to limit the number of non-eu immigrants to just over 24,000 before april 2011 , a fall of five percent on last year .
prime minister david cameron took a tough line on immigration during his election campaign last month , promising reductions .
home secretary theresa may said net immigration had been too high under the previous labour government , and that if left uncontrolled , immigration " was not a good thing " due to the pressure it placed on public services .
" what we have as an aim is indeed to bring immigration down from the hundreds of thousands that it became under labour to the tens of thousands that it used to be .
there are various ways in which we can do that , " she told bbc radio .
" this government believes that britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration , " she said .
may added that the interim limit was necessary to avoid a rush of immigrants ahead of the permanent cap next year .
she said that recent figures showed that migration from eu countries to the uk accounted for around 33 percent of the total , with the rest consisting of non-eu and non-british peoples .
net migration to the uk was 142,000 from january to september last year , down from 160,000 in the previous 12-month period .

the temporary cap is to precede a permanent limit next year . the british government has announced a temporary cap on the number of skilled non-eu immigrants who are allowed to enter britain , ahead of a permanent cap on numbers to be introduced next april .
the temporary curb will take effect next month , and is to limit the number of non-eu immigrants to just over 24,000 before april 2011 , a fall of five percent on last year .
prime minister david cameron took a tough line on immigration during his election campaign last month , promising reductions .
home secretary theresa may said net immigration had been too high under the previous labour government , and that if left uncontrolled , immigration " was not a good thing " due to the pressure it placed on public services .
" what we have as an aim is indeed to bring immigration down from the hundreds of thousands that it became under labour to the tens of thousands that it used to be .
there are various ways in which we can do that , " she told bbc radio .
" this government believes that britain can benefit from migration but not uncontrolled migration , " she said .
may added that the interim limit was necessary to avoid a rush of immigrants ahead of the permanent cap next year .
she said that recent figures showed that migration from eu countries to the uk accounted for around 33 percent of the total , with the rest consisting of non-eu and non-british peoples .
net migration to the uk was 142,000 from january to september last year , down from 160,000 in the previous 12-month period .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 28.06.2010 press review : germany kick england out of the world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : england 's rooney was only one of many disappointments of the match english and german newspapers unanimously condemned the referee for failing to allow frank lampard 's goal .
but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .

npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever .

the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .

but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies .

in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .

the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever .

the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

above the label " garden party , " there 's a photo of two beetles mating on a leaf , then a couple doing the same on a bluff above the words " hiking trip . " each innocuous phrase is meant to be the title of a photo album label on the ipad ad at the rosenthaler platz metro station , but has been made ridiculously bawdy by a street artist 's changes . this mixing of territories and styles between two parties who usually find themselves at odds - ad-posting agencies and street artists - is making for a kind of war in the heart of the german capital . our modern eye is so accustomed to ads - whether in the form of browser pop-ups or spam emails - that we hardly notice them anymore .
but it 's the classic print ad - those hanging on billboards or plastered over the windows of empty shops - which has become the battlefield in the fight for attention in the public sphere . this phenomenon is not unique to the german capital - it reaches from advertising mecca new york city to the booming market of brazil - but is intensified by berlin 's never-ending construction sites and myriad empty storefronts . branding goes guerilla bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it looks like street art - until you notice the company logo a growing awareness of how advertising effects their public spaces has brought about some progressive - some would say stifling - legislation .
in 2007 , the world 's fourth most populated city , san paulo , brazil , became the first outside the communist world to ban nearly all outdoor advertising with its clean city law .
the city 's conservative mayor , gilberto kassab , said at the time that the law aimed to rid the city of " visual pollution . " a few communities in germany have likewise banned what has colloquially become known as the " poster forest " - row after row of billboards . because the average person is bombarded with thousands of advertising messages per day , " companies are faced with the challenge of designing attractive ads which will actively be noticed , " stefan hampel , advertising expert and marketing professor at the bayreuth university , told deutsche welle . to do this , many are turning to " wild posting , " and other non-traditional advertising methods commonly called guerilla marketing .
but hampel said the problem is that , " legally speaking , guerilla advertising actions often occupy a gray zone . " thomas patalas , who heads the maks communications company in the western german city of moenchengladbach has noticed an increase in guerilla marketing over the last couple of years .
in 2008 , german marketing experts estimated that guerilla tactics represented five to 10 percent of all marketing efforts . " today , i would put the number at between 15 and 20 percent , " patalas told deutsche welle .
" the practice has steadily risen and in the meantime has become a standard in the ' communications mix ' for companies . " since a berlin-wide effort during the 2006 world cup in germany , large international companies including nike , nokia and sony have been putting up mural ads on the sides of buildings painted in graffiti designs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , with its many construction sites , offers plenty of spaces for guerilla marketers the guerilla ads are cheaper , more unique , and more stimulating than traditional ad spots , explained patalas .
and traditional ads just do n't work that well anymore .
" the trust in promotional effects of advertisements has continued to sink , " said patalas .
" it 's proportionally at odds with the cost of promotion . " whenever his company has an ad concept that could potential create legal problems , it has the plan reviewed by legal experts , said patalas .
but not all ad companies are so conscientious . " some ad agencies that jump on the guerrilla marketing band wagon are admired for these ad campaign ideas which involve possible legal fines and even calculate them into their budgets , all the while ignoring the possible pr- and image-damage this can cause , " said patalas . bad press still draws attention ogo , which sells a type of smart phone made for teenagers , is one of the companies which has experimented with guerilla advertising - and gotten away with it .
in 2008 and 2009 ogo posted dozens of ads picturing its green three-eyed mascot on the sides of berlin buildings . " we did n't want to come across as a corporation , " lars oehlschlaeger , creative director for the campaign told local media at the time .
" our subversive campaign , on the other hand , was young , impudent and sexy , " he said . street artists did n't take to the campaign very well : some sprayed over the pictures with unambiguous messages like " traitor crap " and " shit . "
however , since the company had made payment deals with building owners , there were no major crackdowns . the us snack company mars did n't get off quite as easy .
a campaign for its uncle ben 's rice that had the slogan " monday is rice day " spray-painted on sidewalks and in subway stations throughout the germany 's major cities was met within a day with a stern order from city authorities to remove the ads and pay fines . " businesses often are fully aware that their actions draw on this grey area , " advertising expert hampel said .
" often the high efficiency and attention that is generated from the press and publicity outweigh the legal consequences , " added hampel . authorities have been more likely to bust " wild " posters in recent years , as the legally questionable ads continue to pop up on construction sheds , fences , poles and building facades , and city officials and citizens become more informed about their legal status . " what 's problematic is whenever the advertising in germany , as well in the us , impinges upon a third party 's rights - like property rights or licensing rights , " said hampel .
some would add the public 's rights to that list . bildunterschrift : seiler and new york street advertising takeover tagged ads with new messages ; a similar project of that scale has n't yet been organized in germany street art creeps onto billboards new york-based street artist jordan seiler aided and documented the downfall of one wild posting company in 2009 through a community effort called new york street advertising takeover -lrb- nysat -rrb- , which involved some 90 citizens and artists who repainted illegally posted advertisements .
the project mainly targeted ads put up by npa city outdoors . though the company did have contracts with the building owners , the spots were not reported to the city , which is legally required of advertisers in new york .
npa city outdoors ended up leaving the lucrative new york city market because of the legal issues the nysat project exposed . there have been no similar crackdowns in germany , but a concerted , albeit unorganized effort to take over large advertisements in its cities is taking form . roland brueckner , 27 , a well-known berlin artist , said the proliferation of wild posting means that " the surfaces for street art are lost forever . "
the result is that street art is jumping into traditional ad space , a trend which the hamburg-based group rebel : art has been documenting around germany . the sightings represent the latest effort by street artists who are fighting for space in the cluttered cityscape of legally and illegally posted ads .
the " additions " to traditional ad spots mainly serve as social or political commentary on either the product or advertising itself . " street art is over , " brueckner said .
" the hype is really gone , and everything being put up now is driven by motives other than purely artistic will . " bildunterschrift : in new york , as in many other cities , both corporations and artists claim space to have their say a race for space " street art and graffiti have gotten to a point where they find themselves in competition with commercial media , " said seiler .
this has caused street artists to " look to legitimate spots " to get their message out . the scandalous ad-busted ipad posters in the subway station in berlin have since been replaced by new ones , but the battle upstairs on the streets continues . " if you are going to put your work on the street , " said seiler , " why not also comment on the over-proliferation of commercial media at the same time by taking back that space for public communication ?

the human playstation bildunterschrift : messi always draws lots of attention any discussion of argentina has to start with fifa world player of the year lionel messi .
at the tender age of 23 , he is already the all-time leading scorer in the champions league for his club barcelona .
arsenal coach arsene wenger called him " unstoppable , " " like a playstation " and " the best player in the world by some distance " after being on the receiving end of one recent barrage .
much has been made of messi 's failure to score yet in the world cup , but no one should be fooled .
the youngster has been drawing two to three markers throughout most matches - in the group stage , greece coach otto rehhagel even assigned a man-to-man marker to do nothing but follow messi around .
that has opened up opportunities for argentina 's strikers , especially gonzalo higuain and carlos tevez .
and after four games , messi already has four assists .
it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .
the trick is to limit his impact somewhat - but even that is going to pose major problems for the german defense . " against germany , i 'm playing double or nothing , " messi told reporters on sunday after argentina had sealed their quarterfinal berth with a 3-1 win over mexico .
the nationalelf has been warned .

juan sebastian veron , on the other hand , is a grizzled 35 year-old veteran who has played for a number of top clubs in europe , including manchester united and chelsea .
what they all have in common , though , are quick feet .
argentina have moved the ball forward faster than any other team at the world cup .
they 're also a reliable defensive unit - which is more than can be said for the gauchos ' back line .
question marks bildunterschrift : demichelis ' concentration has drifted at times if this team has an achilles ' heel , it 's in defense .
center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 28.06.2010 star-studded argentina will put germany to the test in quarterfinals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two biggest names in the cup belong to argentina having dispatched england , the nationalelf now have to face one of the pre-tournament favorites .
argentina are undefeated thus far , and the question is : are they good , very good or world-class ? when germany 's young squad takes to the pitch against argentina on saturday in cape town , they will be forgiven if they 're a bit awe-struck .
lining up on the other side will be a living legend with a short fuse , the consensus choice for the world 's most skilled player and three other forwards who would likely be in the starting eleven if they played for joachim loew .
on the other hand , the gauchos have yet to face any truly top opponents and thus remain as enigmatic as coach diego maradona .
recent history is also on germany 's side : the team knocked out argentina at the same stage of the 2006 world cup . but is there any chance of repeating the upset of the albicelestes this time round ?
the key to success would involve exploiting weaknesses at the back .
and they 'll have to pay special attention to the little guy who wears number 10 .
the human playstation bildunterschrift : messi always draws lots of attention any discussion of argentina has to start with fifa world player of the year lionel messi .
at the tender age of 23 , he is already the all-time leading scorer in the champions league for his club barcelona .
arsenal coach arsene wenger called him " unstoppable , " " like a playstation " and " the best player in the world by some distance " after being on the receiving end of one recent barrage .
much has been made of messi 's failure to score yet in the world cup , but no one should be fooled .
the youngster has been drawing two to three markers throughout most matches - in the group stage , greece coach otto rehhagel even assigned a man-to-man marker to do nothing but follow messi around .
that has opened up opportunities for argentina 's strikers , especially gonzalo higuain and carlos tevez .
and after four games , messi already has four assists .
it is impossible to take messi completely out of a match .
the trick is to limit his impact somewhat - but even that is going to pose major problems for the german defense . " against germany , i 'm playing double or nothing , " messi told reporters on sunday after argentina had sealed their quarterfinal berth with a 3-1 win over mexico .
the nationalelf has been warned .
midfield balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mascherano is argentina 's heart and soul maradona has five quality midfielders at his disposal , and with the exception of captain javier mascherano , who 's played every minute of the world cup , the coach has been rotating them .
they are a diverse lot .
angel di maria is only 22 years old and is a rising star for portugese club benfica .
juan sebastian veron , on the other hand , is a grizzled 35 year-old veteran who has played for a number of top clubs in europe , including manchester united and chelsea .
what they all have in common , though , are quick feet .
argentina have moved the ball forward faster than any other team at the world cup .
they 're also a reliable defensive unit - which is more than can be said for the gauchos ' back line .
question marks bildunterschrift : demichelis ' concentration has drifted at times if this team has an achilles ' heel , it 's in defense .
center back martin demichelis , who plays his club football for bayern munich , was involved in both of the goals argentina have conceded thus far , and his partner nicolas burdisso is standing in for regular walter samuel , who injured a thigh in the group stage .
and 23-year-old keeper sergio romero lacks experience and has looked uncertain at points , especially when forced to come off his line .
it 's difficult to tell how susceptible the gauchos are since the pair of goals they conceded have come in matches where they already held comfortable leads . argentina tend to get lacksadaisical , if they think they have games under control .
so it will be well worth thomas mueller , mesut oezil and lukas podolski probing for weaknesses at the back .
genius or madman ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unclear sometimes what maradona has been trying to say undoubtedly the most inscrutable factor for argentina is the man nominally in charge : maradona .
the living legend 's tirade against journalists after argentina 's difficult qualification for the world cup has become a youtube favorite , and his remarks to the press after progressing to the quarterfinals were n't bad either .
" why should i think about germany , " maradona bellowed at reporters after the mexico win .
" i can think about them tomorrow .
you all write want you want anyway so you can say whatever you want .
have carte blanche to write whatever you want about what i think about germany . "
maradona did swear revenge , however , for the 2006 world cup , when germany put argentina out on penalties .
pundits have debated back and forth whether argentina 's run has been due to or despite their mercurial coach .
but maradona does seem to have his players on his side , and team morale has been good .
and that 's just another reason why argentina is going to be a much , much more difficult adversary for germany than england 's luckless and hapless lot .

standing empty the existence of thousands of vacant properties is an unavoidable fact as buildings become redundant or new developers await planning permission .
it is estimated that between 3-5 percent of buildings lie vacant at any particular point in time . instead of letting this free space go to waste , companies are beginning to tap into this resource to provide a mutually beneficial service .
according to john mills , uk director of camelot property management , the system provides higher quality security at a fraction of the cost .
" employing a 24-hour guard to protect your property would set you back 3,000 pounds per week on average , " he said . " we will manage your vacant property for around 100 pounds per week , so there 's a huge commercial cost saving for property owners .

guardians can be informed of a vacant property at very short notice , sometimes just 24 hours , and are never sure how long they will be able to stay .
" if you 're going to be a guardian , then you have to take on board that you may not be there for more than three months , " said michael eslami .
" obviously you ca n't have pets or children or anything like that and it helps if you are at a crossroads in your life and you can tolerate that level of uncertainty , " he continued .
back to the 70s the idea for the scheme harks back to 1970s holland , when a housing crisis meant that illegal squatters were taking over vacant properties in large numbers .
the laws surrounding squatting were very much a gray area , making it extremely hard for owners to reclaim their properties .
property guardianship provided a neat and happy solution .
by 1993 , the scheme was first introduced to the uk by camelot property management .
there are now a handful of companies offering a similar service throughout the uk .
" we 've found it 's a very successful product to take to different countries away from where it started , " said john mills of camelot .
" we 've now got offices in france , belgium , ireland and we 're about to open in germany and denmark . "
bildunterschrift : the rent may be cheap , but property guardians must be prepared to vacate a premises at short notice an adventure as the recession brings about an increase of vacant properties as well as demand for cheaper rent , property guardianship is becoming an ever more alluring alternative to conventional housing .
for guardians like michael eslami however , taking advantage of the financial benefits of property guardianship was just the tip of the iceberg : " it 's not all disneyland , but there are some great moments and just cherish that - as if you were traveling across a country .
this whole being a guardian is just a journey and if you enjoy that , it 's all the things that you would expect to experience in any other type of unconventional setup . "

' the scheme places live-in guardians into vacant standing properties ; providing the guardian with cheap rent and the owner with cheap 24-hour security for their building .
standing empty the existence of thousands of vacant properties is an unavoidable fact as buildings become redundant or new developers await planning permission .
it is estimated that between 3-5 percent of buildings lie vacant at any particular point in time . instead of letting this free space go to waste , companies are beginning to tap into this resource to provide a mutually beneficial service .
according to john mills , uk director of camelot property management , the system provides higher quality security at a fraction of the cost .
" employing a 24-hour guard to protect your property would set you back 3,000 pounds per week on average , " he said . " we will manage your vacant property for around 100 pounds per week , so there 's a huge commercial cost saving for property owners .
by having people occupying their building , it 's also more effective – so we believe our method of protecting buildings is better as well as cheaper than traditional methods . "
bildunterschrift : delapre abbey in northampton is inhabited and secured by ' property guardians ' affordable eccentrity due to the inherently ' un-residential ' nature of vacant properties , guardians could find themselves in buildings as unusual as castles , old schools or observatories even .
in exchange for protecting these buildings from vandals and squatters , guardians benefit from comparatively cheap rent .
michael eslami is currently living in a six story town house right in the center of london for around 60 pounds per week .
" i think a studio flat or a one bedroom flat would cost you around 450 pounds per week , excluding bills , " he said .
" that 's when you appreciate what you 've got ! "
screening process any potential property guardian has to undergo a screening process to ensure they are eligible .
this includes a criminal record check as well as a credit rating check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guardianship can help make living in london affordable guardians must also take on certain key responsibilities : no parties or large groups of people are allowed , the property can not be left empty for longer than four days at a time and any damage must be immediately reported .
guardians can be informed of a vacant property at very short notice , sometimes just 24 hours , and are never sure how long they will be able to stay .
" if you 're going to be a guardian , then you have to take on board that you may not be there for more than three months , " said michael eslami .
" obviously you ca n't have pets or children or anything like that and it helps if you are at a crossroads in your life and you can tolerate that level of uncertainty , " he continued .
back to the 70s the idea for the scheme harks back to 1970s holland , when a housing crisis meant that illegal squatters were taking over vacant properties in large numbers .
the laws surrounding squatting were very much a gray area , making it extremely hard for owners to reclaim their properties .
property guardianship provided a neat and happy solution .
by 1993 , the scheme was first introduced to the uk by camelot property management .
there are now a handful of companies offering a similar service throughout the uk .
" we 've found it 's a very successful product to take to different countries away from where it started , " said john mills of camelot .
" we 've now got offices in france , belgium , ireland and we 're about to open in germany and denmark . "

it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

meanwhile , anti g-20 protests continued in the streets of toronto . world leaders at the group of 20 summit on sunday pledged to cut their national deficits in half by 2013 and agreed to let members set levies on their banks , but rejected calls for a worldwide tax on financial transactions .
on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .
“ frankly , the outcome was better than i expected , ” said german chancellor angela merkel .
she said leaders had come up with a formula for debt reduction that would not harm growth , a plan that “ corresponds exactly to our timeline . ”
" our challenges are as diverse as our nations , " said us president barack obama .
" but together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy , and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time . "
" there are a range of policy approaches to this end .
some countries are pursuing a financial levy .
other countries are pursuing different approaches , " leaders said in the summit 's final report , which took negotiators at least 45 hours to draft .
transaction tax rejected however , the report was also seen as a blow to european ambitions as it made no reference to a financial transaction tax , a proposal rejected by a " vast majority " of g-20 leaders " at once , " according to diplomatic sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron , right , merkel took time out to watch the world cup merkel , who along with the leaders of britain and france had pushed hard for worldwide support of the tax , admitted that the outcome was less than she had hoped for .
britain , france and germany are all expected to introduce their own bank levies later this year , and the us is also planning a similar move .
merkel had reason to be more upbeat earlier in the day , as she took time out from the conference to watch the second half of the germany-england match with british prime minister david cameron , which germany won 4-1 .
" i am still all excited , " she told reporters .
" i can only say to the german team , go on like this - it was great .
today everything went perfectly in the heads and in the legs . "
clashes continue as world leaders talked and watched the world cup in the convention center , anti g-20 demonstrators continued to protest in numerous locations outside the tightly controlled security perimeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continued on sunday at least 600 protesters had been arrested by late afternoon , as standoffs saw police in full riot gear firing tear gas for the second straight day .
" police are continuing to arrest people who engage in criminal activity , " said police spokeswoman jenn geary .
" if they breach security they 're going to be arrested . "
police adopted a more aggressive strategy sunday by going into the crowd to make arrests , compared to saturday when they stood back as protesters torched four police cars and vandalized stores and banks .
a heavy downpour and severe thunderstorm warning discouraged some protesters , though clashes continued into the evening .
despite the reported violence , toronto police said no serious injuries were reported among police , protesters and bystanders .

russia , meanwhile , remains skeptical about kyrgyzstan 's aspirations . opposition leaders said on monday that they were wary of the results of the weekend referendum , which was hailed by the interim government as an overwhelming display of the country 's desire for a new constitution .
adakhan madumarov , leader of the batun kyrgyzstan party , said the figures were " impossibly high " given the ongoing fallout from deadly ethnic riots that rocked the south of the country earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election commission said turnout was at 69 percent kyrgyzstan 's central election commission said that over 90 percent of voters had approved the plan to make the country a parliamentary republic .
at this point , over 95 percent of districts in kyrgyzstan have reported their results , with voter turnout at just under 70 percent .
" i highly doubt that the central election commission 's data reflects the real picture , as monitors from our party on the ground give conflicting information , " madumarov said .
the former interior minister and head of the ata-zhurt opposition party , omurbek suvanaliyev described the figures as fantasy and accused the interim government of " massive falsification " in the registration of voters .
' overwhelming success ' interim kyrgyz leader roza otunbayeva said the referendum on sunday was an overwhelming success , adding that it had taken place without incident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otunbayeva , center , will stay in power until 2011 " the new constitution has been adopted , despite the savage attacks of its opponents , " otunbayeva told a news conference in the capital , bishkek .
otunbayeva remained convinced that the divisions in the country would not get in the way of her interim government 's plans for reform .
" today the people of kyrgyzstan are voting for stability in the country and the legality of the authorities , " otunbayeva said .
" we will show the world that kyrgyzstan is united . "

russia , meanwhile , remains skeptical about kyrgyzstan 's aspirations . opposition leaders said on monday that they were wary of the results of the weekend referendum , which was hailed by the interim government as an overwhelming display of the country 's desire for a new constitution .
adakhan madumarov , leader of the batun kyrgyzstan party , said the figures were " impossibly high " given the ongoing fallout from deadly ethnic riots that rocked the south of the country earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election commission said turnout was at 69 percent kyrgyzstan 's central election commission said that over 90 percent of voters had approved the plan to make the country a parliamentary republic .
at this point , over 95 percent of districts in kyrgyzstan have reported their results , with voter turnout at just under 70 percent .
" i highly doubt that the central election commission 's data reflects the real picture , as monitors from our party on the ground give conflicting information , " madumarov said .
the former interior minister and head of the ata-zhurt opposition party , omurbek suvanaliyev described the figures as fantasy and accused the interim government of " massive falsification " in the registration of voters .
' overwhelming success ' interim kyrgyz leader roza otunbayeva said the referendum on sunday was an overwhelming success , adding that it had taken place without incident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otunbayeva , center , will stay in power until 2011 " the new constitution has been adopted , despite the savage attacks of its opponents , " otunbayeva told a news conference in the capital , bishkek .
otunbayeva remained convinced that the divisions in the country would not get in the way of her interim government 's plans for reform .
" today the people of kyrgyzstan are voting for stability in the country and the legality of the authorities , " otunbayeva said .
" we will show the world that kyrgyzstan is united . "

meanwhile , anti g-20 protests continued in the streets of toronto . world leaders at the group of 20 summit on sunday pledged to cut their national deficits in half by 2013 and agreed to let members set levies on their banks , but rejected calls for a worldwide tax on financial transactions .
on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .
“ frankly , the outcome was better than i expected , ” said german chancellor angela merkel .
she said leaders had come up with a formula for debt reduction that would not harm growth , a plan that “ corresponds exactly to our timeline . ”
" our challenges are as diverse as our nations , " said us president barack obama .
" but together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy , and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time . "
" there are a range of policy approaches to this end .
some countries are pursuing a financial levy .
other countries are pursuing different approaches , " leaders said in the summit 's final report , which took negotiators at least 45 hours to draft .
transaction tax rejected however , the report was also seen as a blow to european ambitions as it made no reference to a financial transaction tax , a proposal rejected by a " vast majority " of g-20 leaders " at once , " according to diplomatic sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron , right , merkel took time out to watch the world cup merkel , who along with the leaders of britain and france had pushed hard for worldwide support of the tax , admitted that the outcome was less than she had hoped for .
britain , france and germany are all expected to introduce their own bank levies later this year , and the us is also planning a similar move .
merkel had reason to be more upbeat earlier in the day , as she took time out from the conference to watch the second half of the germany-england match with british prime minister david cameron , which germany won 4-1 .
" i am still all excited , " she told reporters .
" i can only say to the german team , go on like this - it was great .
today everything went perfectly in the heads and in the legs . "
clashes continue as world leaders talked and watched the world cup in the convention center , anti g-20 demonstrators continued to protest in numerous locations outside the tightly controlled security perimeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continued on sunday at least 600 protesters had been arrested by late afternoon , as standoffs saw police in full riot gear firing tear gas for the second straight day .
" police are continuing to arrest people who engage in criminal activity , " said police spokeswoman jenn geary .
" if they breach security they 're going to be arrested . "
police adopted a more aggressive strategy sunday by going into the crowd to make arrests , compared to saturday when they stood back as protesters torched four police cars and vandalized stores and banks .
a heavy downpour and severe thunderstorm warning discouraged some protesters , though clashes continued into the evening .
despite the reported violence , toronto police said no serious injuries were reported among police , protesters and bystanders .

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's press hail loew for having built a real team online paper spiegel online describes the victory as a " summer fairytale .
joachim loew has achieved what hardly anyone thought he would : the german coach has built up fantastic players for this world cup .
after the sensational victory against england it 's plain to see - thomas mueller and miroslav klose are the players of the day .
how far will they get ?
" wembley is now called bloemfontein , " daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes .
" everything would have been different if the referee had given the goal which would have made it 2-2 , " the paper recognized .
the weekly soccer magazine kicker sees the game as once again illustrating the need for better refereeing .
" bring on the computer chip in the ball !
this is not about diminishing the top performance of the great german side .
but such a refereeing mistake in the year 2010 - incredible !
if you talk about fair play in sports , then you finally have to allow the technological aids like the chip in the ball or a goal-line camera . "

for instance , you can provide access to clean drinking water for 50 million people .
or save the lives of 800,000 infants .
or , you can spend that money on a gigantic summit meeting , like the one that took place in canada over the weekend .
the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations - and later of the 20 most important economies - met in toronto .
considering the financial cost of the meeting , the results were weak .
one plan on the table but there is also another way of looking at it : considering how much money has been spent recently on rescuing banks and even entire nations , a billion dollars is n't much at all .
the global financial markets need a new structure - that much is beyond question .
but when it comes to figuring out how top politicians should go about making these changes , the devil is in the details .
the financial world has entire legions of lobbyists out fighting against over-regulation .
economies ca n't function without money , and indeed , regulations ca n't be so tight that they squeeze the life out of the banks .
an economy ca n't function without liquidity .
but banks need to resume their original role - that of service-providers to the economy - not of gamblers who do n't know their limits .
also , they have to be able to go bankrupt without pulling the entire financial system into ruin .
a plan for a new architecture for our global financial system is on the table .
us president barack obama proudly unveiled it in toronto .
in washington , congress is expected to pass the law this week .
the europeans were impressed - and will need to get moving in order to come up with their own plan .
surprises and disappointments the summit was preceded by the rolling thunder of discord ; america versus germany , spending versus austerity . but in the end , reason prevailed .
the ambitious formula : growth through intelligent austerity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme these kinds of conflicts are important .
in the final analysis , the players find themselves on virgin political soil .
no one can come up with the ultimate solution , because every country is faced with different conditions .
thus , the debate has no winners and no losers - and that was the big surprise that came out of toronto .
but the financial crisis pushed other important topics - like climate change , say , or the fight against poverty and hunger - right off the agenda . at this point , even the wealthy nations themselves are admitting that they have n't kept their promises to poorer countries .
maybe that is why more recent promises - like the initiative to fight maternal and infant death , proposed here in toronto , - are somewhat more modest .
it is miserable to see how much money wealthy countries are willing and able to throw around in order to keep their own heads above water .
and that was the big disappointment that came out of toronto .
a new litmus test be that as it may , the g20 nations need to come together .
at some point , the crisis that forced them to come together , will be over .
and the introduction of financial market reforms could divide the group .
the g20 is different from the g8 in that all the countries do n't share the same values .
it sounds positive when china not only loosens its monetary policy ahead of the meeting , but then goes on to advocate sustainable growth during the summit itself .
in any case , the real litmus test for the g20 still lies ahead , since many of the important decisions for a new world financial order were pushed back to the coming summit in south korea .
the big crisis is n't far behind us .
and only in seoul will we be able to look back and gauge the success - or lack thereof - of the toronto summit .

for instance , you can provide access to clean drinking water for 50 million people .
or save the lives of 800,000 infants .
or , you can spend that money on a gigantic summit meeting , like the one that took place in canada over the weekend .
the heads of the eight leading industrialized nations - and later of the 20 most important economies - met in toronto .
considering the financial cost of the meeting , the results were weak .
one plan on the table but there is also another way of looking at it : considering how much money has been spent recently on rescuing banks and even entire nations , a billion dollars is n't much at all .
the global financial markets need a new structure - that much is beyond question .
but when it comes to figuring out how top politicians should go about making these changes , the devil is in the details .
the financial world has entire legions of lobbyists out fighting against over-regulation .
economies ca n't function without money , and indeed , regulations ca n't be so tight that they squeeze the life out of the banks .
an economy ca n't function without liquidity .
but banks need to resume their original role - that of service-providers to the economy - not of gamblers who do n't know their limits .
also , they have to be able to go bankrupt without pulling the entire financial system into ruin .
a plan for a new architecture for our global financial system is on the table .
us president barack obama proudly unveiled it in toronto .
in washington , congress is expected to pass the law this week .
the europeans were impressed - and will need to get moving in order to come up with their own plan .
surprises and disappointments the summit was preceded by the rolling thunder of discord ; america versus germany , spending versus austerity . but in the end , reason prevailed .
the ambitious formula : growth through intelligent austerity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik boehme these kinds of conflicts are important .
in the final analysis , the players find themselves on virgin political soil .
no one can come up with the ultimate solution , because every country is faced with different conditions .
thus , the debate has no winners and no losers - and that was the big surprise that came out of toronto .
but the financial crisis pushed other important topics - like climate change , say , or the fight against poverty and hunger - right off the agenda . at this point , even the wealthy nations themselves are admitting that they have n't kept their promises to poorer countries .
maybe that is why more recent promises - like the initiative to fight maternal and infant death , proposed here in toronto , - are somewhat more modest .
it is miserable to see how much money wealthy countries are willing and able to throw around in order to keep their own heads above water .
and that was the big disappointment that came out of toronto .
a new litmus test be that as it may , the g20 nations need to come together .
at some point , the crisis that forced them to come together , will be over .
and the introduction of financial market reforms could divide the group .
the g20 is different from the g8 in that all the countries do n't share the same values .
it sounds positive when china not only loosens its monetary policy ahead of the meeting , but then goes on to advocate sustainable growth during the summit itself .
in any case , the real litmus test for the g20 still lies ahead , since many of the important decisions for a new world financial order were pushed back to the coming summit in south korea .
the big crisis is n't far behind us .
and only in seoul will we be able to look back and gauge the success - or lack thereof - of the toronto summit .

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .

the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .

yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "

but the shadow of the 1966 final gave the match an historic dimension . after germany defeated england 4-1 , the three lions have to pack their bags and end their world cup ambitions .
newspapers in both countries left no doubt that the referee missed what should have been the crucial equalizer by frank lampard - and called on fifa to introduce technology to avoid such blunders in the future .
but english papers were quick to admitt that their side 's defeat was down to a poor performance rather than one mistake by the ref .
for the germans , the game set the record straight - in the 1966 world cup final a similar refereeing blunder led to an england victory .
" victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten " mass circulation daily the sun is in no doubt as to who is to blame for england 's defeat .
" time to go fabio .
clear off - and take your players with you , " it wrote , referring to the team coach fabio capello .
the broadsheet daily telegraph warns that the controversy over lampard 's goal must not serve as an excuse for the english side 's defeat .
" do n't be be fooled by fabio capello 's smokescreen over frank lampard 's ' goal ' .
even if the midfielder 's exceptional shot had stood , as it should , england can not escape the brutal reality that germany were superior in every department .
broadsheet the guardian takes a look back at the long history of the england-germany rivalry .
since the world cup final in 1966 , the three lions are still waiting for a major victory over germany .
" only the details and the venues change in the story of how england impersonate a serious international power .
in the last 10 years alone that conceit has been exposed in charleroi , shizuoka , lisbon , gelsenkirchen and now bloemfontein .
the men of 1966 can pack their diaries with yet more heroes ' dinners and brand-ambassador spin-offs because 44 years of waiting could be just the start . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for germany 's bild it was a perfect revenge for wembley for the tabloid daily mirror , the performance of the english side was beyond compare .
" there have been many shameful england performances in the 44 years since we lifted the world cup .
but none more shameful than our humiliation by the german side yesterday .
yes , england were robbed of a goal in the first half .
but that decision can not excuse an appalling performance by our national side .
these spoiled young men , who enjoy privileges and riches beyond most people 's dreams , had neither passion nor heart . "
" awful performance leaves fabio capello with no excuses , " writes the daily mail .
" the ball was over the line but a disallowed goal is not why this world cup is now over for england . "
the daily broadsheet the independent sees england as " victims of a cruel injustice , but ultimately well beaten . "
but the paper also pointed out that the referee 's error just proved the point that video replays for referees were long overdue .
" we should have technology in football 10 years into the 21st century , just as we have running water and antibiotics . "
" what a great revenge for wembley ! "
" thanks guys !
this was incredible ! " is what germany 's mass circulation bild has to say .
" what a world cup battle - what a great revenge for wembley !
germany humiliates england 4-1 and deserved it 's luck when the ref larrionda failed to give the clear goal by lampard .
his shot deflected off the bar just like at wembley in 1966 .
it was clearly behind the line - and it would have been the equalizer … " the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily describes the game as " a match that will go down in collective memory .
44 years after the wembley goal in the world cup final of 1966 , sunday 's match was a strange resemblence of what happened back then - but this time things went in favor of the germans .
and the english have the right to complain as the ball was clearly in .
it 's hard to believe how these things can be avoided in football as long as fifa refuses to allow video replays . "
for the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung , the parallels with wembley marked the evening .
" it 's unbelievable .
after 44 years we 're finally even with the english .
but this is not about payback time .
if the english - despite all electronic evidence - still refuse to admit that in ' 66 the goal was not in , then we do n't have the slightest problem saying that this time - ' yes , the ball was in . " '

meanwhile , anti g-20 protests continued in the streets of toronto . world leaders at the group of 20 summit on sunday pledged to cut their national deficits in half by 2013 and agreed to let members set levies on their banks , but rejected calls for a worldwide tax on financial transactions .
on the second day of the two-day summit in toronto , the leaders of the world 's most powerful economies said their countries would have to move at their own pace and adopt " differentiated and tailored " economies to suit their contrasting priorities without stunting growth .
“ frankly , the outcome was better than i expected , ” said german chancellor angela merkel .
she said leaders had come up with a formula for debt reduction that would not harm growth , a plan that “ corresponds exactly to our timeline . ”
" our challenges are as diverse as our nations , " said us president barack obama .
" but together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy , and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time . "
" there are a range of policy approaches to this end .
some countries are pursuing a financial levy .
other countries are pursuing different approaches , " leaders said in the summit 's final report , which took negotiators at least 45 hours to draft .
transaction tax rejected however , the report was also seen as a blow to european ambitions as it made no reference to a financial transaction tax , a proposal rejected by a " vast majority " of g-20 leaders " at once , " according to diplomatic sources .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cameron , right , merkel took time out to watch the world cup merkel , who along with the leaders of britain and france had pushed hard for worldwide support of the tax , admitted that the outcome was less than she had hoped for .
britain , france and germany are all expected to introduce their own bank levies later this year , and the us is also planning a similar move .
merkel had reason to be more upbeat earlier in the day , as she took time out from the conference to watch the second half of the germany-england match with british prime minister david cameron , which germany won 4-1 .
" i am still all excited , " she told reporters .
" i can only say to the german team , go on like this - it was great .
today everything went perfectly in the heads and in the legs . "
clashes continue as world leaders talked and watched the world cup in the convention center , anti g-20 demonstrators continued to protest in numerous locations outside the tightly controlled security perimeter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests continued on sunday at least 600 protesters had been arrested by late afternoon , as standoffs saw police in full riot gear firing tear gas for the second straight day .
" police are continuing to arrest people who engage in criminal activity , " said police spokeswoman jenn geary .
" if they breach security they 're going to be arrested . "
police adopted a more aggressive strategy sunday by going into the crowd to make arrests , compared to saturday when they stood back as protesters torched four police cars and vandalized stores and banks .
a heavy downpour and severe thunderstorm warning discouraged some protesters , though clashes continued into the evening .
despite the reported violence , toronto police said no serious injuries were reported among police , protesters and bystanders .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 28.06.2010 race for knowledge spurs physics research at cern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc has been producing collisions since march the large hadron collider is coming late to the party and has a lot to prove in the particle physics community .
it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

russia , meanwhile , remains skeptical about kyrgyzstan 's aspirations . opposition leaders said on monday that they were wary of the results of the weekend referendum , which was hailed by the interim government as an overwhelming display of the country 's desire for a new constitution .
adakhan madumarov , leader of the batun kyrgyzstan party , said the figures were " impossibly high " given the ongoing fallout from deadly ethnic riots that rocked the south of the country earlier this month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election commission said turnout was at 69 percent kyrgyzstan 's central election commission said that over 90 percent of voters had approved the plan to make the country a parliamentary republic .
at this point , over 95 percent of districts in kyrgyzstan have reported their results , with voter turnout at just under 70 percent .
" i highly doubt that the central election commission 's data reflects the real picture , as monitors from our party on the ground give conflicting information , " madumarov said .
the former interior minister and head of the ata-zhurt opposition party , omurbek suvanaliyev described the figures as fantasy and accused the interim government of " massive falsification " in the registration of voters .
' overwhelming success ' interim kyrgyz leader roza otunbayeva said the referendum on sunday was an overwhelming success , adding that it had taken place without incident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otunbayeva , center , will stay in power until 2011 " the new constitution has been adopted , despite the savage attacks of its opponents , " otunbayeva told a news conference in the capital , bishkek .
otunbayeva remained convinced that the divisions in the country would not get in the way of her interim government 's plans for reform .
" today the people of kyrgyzstan are voting for stability in the country and the legality of the authorities , " otunbayeva said .
" we will show the world that kyrgyzstan is united . "
the interim government defiantly pressed ahead with the vote despite deadly clashes between minority uzbeks and majority kyrgyz earlier this month , which sparked fears of a collapse of the country .
medvedev skeptical russian president dmitri medvedev , speaking after the g20 summit in toronto , expressed doubt as to whether the country was ready for a parliamentary democracy - or even whether kyrgyz authorities could impose order at present .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev says kyrgyzstan is too unstabile for democracy " in its current state , there are a host of scenarios for kyrgyzstan , including the most unpleasant scenario - the collapse of the state , " medvedev said . at least 294 people were killed this month in violence between ethnic kyrgyz and uzbeks in southern kyrgyzstan , a former soviet republic which hosts us and russian military air bases and shares a border with china . author : gabriel borrud -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the application was prompted in part by the global crisis in the banking sector and in part by a need for greater flexibility in providing financial services to big customers , according to siemens chief financial officer joe kaeser .
safe investments " in the current situation , with a legislative environment that is not totally transparent , we can be affected if banks have problems , " kaeser said in an interview with the german newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung .
" our liquidity now amounts to about 9 billion euros , which means we really need to be able to make safe investments .
we can do this ourselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has no plans to complete with retail banks like commerzbank siemens also wants to beef up its financial services .
but unlike some other industrial companies , it has no plans to expand into the retail banking business , kaeser said .
general electric -lrb- ge -rrb- , for instance , has been operating a retail banking arm and providing financial services to businesses for more than 50 years .
german carmakers bmw , daimler and volkswagen are other examples of manufacturers offering banking services , such as loans and debit cards .
siemens sees several advantages in having its own banking license , according to company spokesman georg haux .
among them : the ability to place deposits directly with the german central bank and save on transaction fees levied by banks .
managing a mountain of money " for years , siemens has been offering financial services to companies managing big engineering projects , such as wind parks , " haux told deutsche welle .
" with a license , it will now be easier to provide financial services to these groups and others . "
although siemens ' core competency is in engineering and not finance , the company has successfully managed a mountain of money for decades , according to thomas vybierck , an analyst with nordlb .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens has liquid assets worth some 9 billion euros " siemens has deep financial know-how and many very good people in this area ; i 'm not at all surprised by the move , " vybierck said .
" in fact , there is a saying here that ' siemens is a bank with an electronics business . " '
the analyst expects siemens will also use its license to put competitive pressure on its " house banks " to attain better conditions .

but the nationalelf won the match 4-1 because of , and not despite its youth . the turning point in the germany-england match came in minute 67 .
having narrowly preserved a 2-1 advantage , thanks to a terrible call on a goal not given to england , germany had their backs against the wall .
the three lions were pressing , and the nationalelf were happy just to get the ball out of their own half .
then thomas mueller stepped up .
after sparking a counterattack and getting the ball back from bastian schweinsteiger , mueller decided to have a go at goal and banged the ball in off england keeper david james ' elbow .
three minutes later , mueller slotted home a fine pass from mesut oezil , and the lions ' will was broken .
add together mueller and oezil 's ages , and you 'll come up with 41 .
in comparison , james turns 40 this august .
ahead of the world cup , there was speculation that germany 's youth might put their chances at risk .
after the england match , it seems one main reason germany have gotten this far is a preponderance of young talent .
bildunterschrift : mueller earned his high-five from loew keeping cool before the match , many english fans had probably never heard of mueller , but his breakout did not come out of the blue .
in his first full season as a professional for his club bayern munich , mueller scored 13 goals in the bundesliga .
and he played in the champions league final , which steven gerrard , frank lampard and wayne rooney all watched on tv .
" when you think about what you 'll do in promising situations before the match , you ca n't be getting nervous , " the 20-year-old , who also picked up an assist on germany 's second goal , told german television after the match .
his coach was full of praise .
" i 've rarely seen him blow a chance , " joachim loew said .
" in front of goal , he 's just cold as ice . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil has become the boss in offensive midfield and he 's not the only young player who has been performing for germany .
twenty-one-year-old oezil has become the focal point in attack for the nationalelf and has attracted the attention of europe 's larger clubs .
sami khedira , 23 , has n't shone as brightly , but he has plugged part of the hole left by the injury to former captain michael ballack .
jerome boateng and holger badstuber , both 21 , have also proved capable role players on a footballing stage usually occupied by veterans .
and what has to be frightening to opponents - in the future , if not necessarily in this world cup - is the fact that german mainstays schweinsteiger , lukas podolski and phillip lahm are themselves only 25 , 25 and 26 respectively .
still lots to learn the match against england , as almost anyone would admit , was not as one-sided as the scoreline might suggest .
as the first half wore on , a mistake by 24-year-old goalkeeper manuel neuer gifted england a chance at a comeback .
and had the linesman seen a shot by frank lampard as over the line , which it clearly was , the game would have been tied at 2-all , and the outcome might have been different .
germany foundered for the middle half of the match .
the impressive thing was that they managed to keep their heads and recover .
neuer - one of europe 's most highly rated young keepers - held his nerves in the second half , and his offensive colleagues kept attacking .
" it was good to be under such pressure against ghana in the group stage , " loew said .
" i think we learned a lot from that , and we were able to press forward against england with confidence .
i was impressed . "
bildunterschrift : the future looks very , very bright change of the guard it will be interesting to see whether young germany also impress , if they have to face one of the top sides in the tournament .
such an opponent , argentina , is lurking in the quarterfinals .
but one thing is clear : this is a radically different german national team , with a different cast of characters , to its immediate predecessors .
a poignant moment came after the match when ballack was asked to rate the performance of mueller , who has worn the number 13 , traditionally ballack 's , throughout the world cup .
ballack praised germany 's win and uttered the usual promises injured veterans make about coming back for another shot at glory on the international stage .
but he had to have known that the players who beat england are not going to relinquish their spots in the squad voluntarily .
whether ballack ever dons the 13 again for germany is an open question .
against england , germany did n't need him to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 28.06.2010 race for knowledge spurs physics research at cern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc has been producing collisions since march the large hadron collider is coming late to the party and has a lot to prove in the particle physics community .
it 's no surprise then that a little competitive jockeying plays a role in cern 's research strategy . the large hadron collider -lrb- lhc -rrb- at the european organization for nuclear research , better known by its french acronym , cern , has been colliding beams since march of this year , after an abortive attempt in september , 2008 .
the lhc now has to produce as many collisions as possible in the next two years in order for the various experiments at cern to essentially prove their worth among other established particle physics laboratories .
the past failures of the lhc weighed heavily on operations group leader mike lamont who talked about some of the criticism from the media .
" the americans in particular can be quite aggressive , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's quite clear that we 're competing with the states , and we 've had setbacks , and you can see journalists occasionally being aggressive about that , " he said .
" i mean ' you 're spending taxpayers ' money , and you 're still messing up , ' which can be a fair comment . "
raising the bar the competitive element of the research performed at the lhc also extends beyond mere media heckling , however , seeming to be an essential part of cern 's research strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lhc staff is under pressuure to produce as many collisions as possible one of the lessons learned from the failed start of the lhc in 2008 , was that the machine would not be able to reach its desired energy output of circulating 7.0 tera electron volt -lrb- tev -rrb- beams .
instead the scientists on the project must make the most of the current maximum of 3.5 tev beams that collide at a combined 7.0 tev , half of the original goal .
only if the experiments meet their goals for collected data by 2012 , lamont said , would cern pull ahead of the research performed at the us-based fermilab , a particle accelerator located near chicago , illinois that measures 6.3 kilometers in circumference .
" we 've got reach in energy , but they 're still sort of chasing at our heels , " lamont said .
" so if we can collect enough data in 2010 and 2011 , we essentially put them out of business , then we can relax in 2012 and fix the -lsb- lhc -rsb- properly . "
common goals not everyone at cern is so concerned with being in first place , however .
yves schutz , at alice , one of the experiments studying the lhc data , takes a more egalitarian position .
alice , which is an acronym for a large ion collider experiment , will be studying collisions of lead ions in the lhc , looking for primordial matter called the quark-gluon plasma , believed to have existed for a few millionths of a second after the big bang .
at the brookhaven national laboratory in new york , the relativistic heavy ion collider -lrb- rhic -rrb- is pursuing a very similar course of study .
in february rhic announced that it had found the " quark soup " after colliding gold ions .
for schutz , this did n't constitute a threat to his own research , so much as an opportunity to collaborate .
" we have very regular joint meetings , " he said .
" rhic is just paving the way for lhc ; it 's no different , just complementary , " schutz said .
" nuclear research has always proceeded in steps , and every step was the advent of new accelerators with higher energies . "
but schutz could n't resist one small barb at the smaller american program .
" we have a good number of physicists who worked at rhic who have joined alice , but the opposite is not the case , " he said with a smile .

' the scheme places live-in guardians into vacant standing properties ; providing the guardian with cheap rent and the owner with cheap 24-hour security for their building .
standing empty the existence of thousands of vacant properties is an unavoidable fact as buildings become redundant or new developers await planning permission .
it is estimated that between 3-5 percent of buildings lie vacant at any particular point in time . instead of letting this free space go to waste , companies are beginning to tap into this resource to provide a mutually beneficial service .
according to john mills , uk director of camelot property management , the system provides higher quality security at a fraction of the cost .
" employing a 24-hour guard to protect your property would set you back 3,000 pounds per week on average , " he said . " we will manage your vacant property for around 100 pounds per week , so there 's a huge commercial cost saving for property owners .
by having people occupying their building , it 's also more effective – so we believe our method of protecting buildings is better as well as cheaper than traditional methods . "
bildunterschrift : delapre abbey in northampton is inhabited and secured by ' property guardians ' affordable eccentrity due to the inherently ' un-residential ' nature of vacant properties , guardians could find themselves in buildings as unusual as castles , old schools or observatories even .
in exchange for protecting these buildings from vandals and squatters , guardians benefit from comparatively cheap rent .
michael eslami is currently living in a six story town house right in the center of london for around 60 pounds per week .
" i think a studio flat or a one bedroom flat would cost you around 450 pounds per week , excluding bills , " he said .
" that 's when you appreciate what you 've got ! "
screening process any potential property guardian has to undergo a screening process to ensure they are eligible .
this includes a criminal record check as well as a credit rating check .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guardianship can help make living in london affordable guardians must also take on certain key responsibilities : no parties or large groups of people are allowed , the property can not be left empty for longer than four days at a time and any damage must be immediately reported .
guardians can be informed of a vacant property at very short notice , sometimes just 24 hours , and are never sure how long they will be able to stay .
" if you 're going to be a guardian , then you have to take on board that you may not be there for more than three months , " said michael eslami .
" obviously you ca n't have pets or children or anything like that and it helps if you are at a crossroads in your life and you can tolerate that level of uncertainty , " he continued .
back to the 70s the idea for the scheme harks back to 1970s holland , when a housing crisis meant that illegal squatters were taking over vacant properties in large numbers .
the laws surrounding squatting were very much a gray area , making it extremely hard for owners to reclaim their properties .
property guardianship provided a neat and happy solution .
by 1993 , the scheme was first introduced to the uk by camelot property management .
there are now a handful of companies offering a similar service throughout the uk .
" we 've found it 's a very successful product to take to different countries away from where it started , " said john mills of camelot .
" we 've now got offices in france , belgium , ireland and we 're about to open in germany and denmark . "
bildunterschrift : the rent may be cheap , but property guardians must be prepared to vacate a premises at short notice an adventure as the recession brings about an increase of vacant properties as well as demand for cheaper rent , property guardianship is becoming an ever more alluring alternative to conventional housing .
for guardians like michael eslami however , taking advantage of the financial benefits of property guardianship was just the tip of the iceberg : " it 's not all disneyland , but there are some great moments and just cherish that - as if you were traveling across a country .
this whole being a guardian is just a journey and if you enjoy that , it 's all the things that you would expect to experience in any other type of unconventional setup . "
