program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .

regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

dw-world.de death toll climbs amid renewed fighting in kyrgyzstan tens of thousands of refugees are fleeing ethnic fighting in kyrgyzstan as aid groups try to get relief supplies into the region .
bishkek has warned that the conflict could spread north to neighboring countries .

frans muller , a board member of germany 's metro group , admitted that these are serious problems , but he also pointed out that growing economies have an edge when it comes to being innovative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus schwab speaks at the world economic forum on east asia " i think asia has not only a challenge , but also in this respect an enormous chance , " muller said .
" what you see is that more and more international companies establish their r & d centers in asia , particularly china , korea and japan ; and that a lot of technologies that are now a strength of asia , are linked to green technologies .
interfaces are possible : there are a lot of opportunities between the it sector in asia , which is very strong , and green technologies .
so there are a lot of opportunities that the green challenge will also bring green technology growth to industries in asia . "
governments lead the way in order to tap this potential , the role of governments is crucial .
many asian governments such as china and south korea have made green growth a policy priority .
south korea 's deputy environment minister yoon jong-soo explained what his administration has been doing to mobilize the citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese continue to rely heavily on highly polluting coal ...
he gave three examples : " one is the green start movement .
it is a nationwide campaign : we have to adopt a green lifestyle .
the second is the carbon point system : when households reduce carbon emissions and save energy , they get rewards in the form of cash or coupons .
the third is a ' carbon labeling ' system .
it provides information how much carbon dioxide has been emitted in the course of production , transportation and disposal of goods .
incentives are very important , rather than regulations . "
oil subsidies prevent innovation but stuart dean , who heads general electric in the asean region , cautioned that other policies in asia hinder growth in the green sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but they also have become leading producers in solar technology " i think one of the areas that really need to be addressed early on is the area of subsidies for fossil fuels .
at least half of the countries in asia still have subsidies for fossil fuel , which then affect the pricing of electricity .
we recognize that there are socio-economic groups that benefit from those subsidies ; but i think it is also clear there are better ways to do income redistribution than subsidizing everyone 's use of fossil fuels . "
dean said europe became a leader in alternative energies only because high taxes made oil products expensive .
both industry and government representatives agreed that there is enormous potential for public-private partnerships in the realm of green growth .
with the right leadership , asia 's booming economies might soon become known as the " green tigers " .

as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .

honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .

dutch striker eljero elia took a shot from close range , which sorensen managed to get a hand on and deflect into the post .
the ball bounced back into play , where elia 's teammate dirk kuyt cleanly sent the rebound to the back of the net for the game 's final goal .
the netherlands and japan are tied on points at the top of group e , with the dutch having the better goal differential .

now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .
daisuke matsui crossed from the right wing to the opposite side of the goal and found keisuke honda all alone .
honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .

whether they say " ja " after a federal government " nein " is unclear . after more than a year of tough negotiations over opel 's future , industry and financial experts agree the carmaker does n't need to hear another " jein " , a german expression for " yes and no " , on the topic of public aid .
that was more or less the response of chancellor angela merkel last week when she rejected opel 's request for loan guarantees at the federal level but said the company was free to seek aid from state governments and other groups , including the european investment bank .
explore options the states hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have agreed to explore options at a tuesday meeting after the federal government rejected the auto manufacturer 's request for aid .
opel had applied for 1.1 billion euros in federal guarantees from a pool of government bailout money , dubbed the " deutschlandfond " , to back private-sector loans .
us-based auto giant general motors , which owns opel , says it needs more than 3 billion euros to restructure its european operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel is up and down on helping opel when announcing the government 's decision last week , chancellor merkel said the four states were " able " to give loan guarantees .
and all four have signaled a willingness to help financially .
to what extent will be the focus of tuesday 's meeting .
the four states are eager to help opel for a number of reasons , but the biggest is jobs .
plants in their states employ more than 23,000 people - half of opel 's total workforce in europe .
and thousands of more jobs are linked to providing car parts and other goods and services to the plants .
there is state money .
hesse , for instance , has a 1.5 billion euro guarantee program for 2010 .
last year the state lent opel 347 million euros as part of an emergency bridge loan .
the loan has since been repaid with interest .
" complete catastrophe " but speculation is rife that the states have yet to agree to a coordinated approach and could walk away from the talks without a plan .
" the situation with opel is a complete catastrophe , " said christoph stuermer , an industry analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
" the entire process has been terribly mismanaged by politicians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel employees , more than 23,000 in europe , want to keep their jobs helmut becker , director of the institute for economic analysis and communication in munich , is highly critical of german taxpayers being forced to cover any expenses for the us carmaker .
" why should anybody subsidize carmakers now that their business has bounced back , with sales up 30 , 40 , even 50 percent depending on the market ? "
becker asked .
" why give them money in the middle of a boom ? "
financial responsibility not only that , becker argues that if gm is so determined to keep opel , then the parent must accept financial responsibility for its subsidiary .
last year , germany was ready to back a bid for opel led by canada 's magna international , but the us carmaker reversed its plan to sell the german company .
gm is in a difficult position to negotiate deals .
the company would have collapsed if the us government had not sweetened a structured insolvency with around $ 50 billion -lrb- 41 million euros -rrb- in public funds .
the government holds a majority stake in the company .
and as long as the carmaker , dubbed " government motors " by critics of state aid , remains state-owned , it can expect to face political winds when trying to tap funds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 the continent has its world cup , but can an african nation actually win it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's asamoah gyan scored the goal that gave africa its first win in the tournament the world cup had to wait for 82 years before it could come to an african nation .
now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 the continent has its world cup , but can an african nation actually win it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's asamoah gyan scored the goal that gave africa its first win in the tournament the world cup had to wait for 82 years before it could come to an african nation .
now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.06.2010 merkel and sarkozy present united front after meeting in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is wary of germany 's historic austerity package chancellor merkel met president sarkozy in berlin , where they discussed a joint strategy on europe 's debt crisis .
both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

new delhi 's high court decriminalized homosexuality by striking down parts of the country 's colonial-era penal code .
but the fight has not stopped there .
the community is struggling for greater social acceptance and full legal rights . after last year 's historic verdict that ended state-sanctioned homophobia , india 's fledgling gay community is working to ensure that the delhi high court 's decisive verdict is not overturned in the supreme court .
but simultaneously , the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender or lgbt community as it is widely known , has begun fighting for legal rights .
gautam bhan , a prominent gay activist , outlines the roadmap ahead : " we have long said as part of the gay rights movement that the victory in the delhi high court last july , was not the victory that ended a battle .
it was a victory that began one .
i mean really the fight has started now .
decriminalization was the first step .
there is still no positive legal inclusion for gays and lesbians in the indian legal framework .
for example there is no non-discrimination in employment , or in health benefits or taxation or in joint home loans or in the right to visit your partner when they are sick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters celebrate in delhi following the landmark ruling on july 2 , 2009 gay rights and law indian law does not recognize same-sex marriages , nor does it provide for civil unions .
in fact the government is planning to bring in legislation under which gay and lesbian couples can not have children born with the help of an indian surrogate mother .
it is these exclusions that the lgbt community is striving to abolish . " there is a range of exclusions that are built into the system at this point , " says bhan .
" marriage , adoption and family law is well known among this range of exclusions .
but i think particularly critical to us are exclusions based on livelihood , work and employment .
it is still very difficult for transgender to get identification .
hiring practices : people getting fired and being unable to come out at work .
people still fear for their physical safety from the police , even though that has begun to change , so i think in a range of these - from personal , to the private and to intimate , there are still many structural constraints facing the gay-lesbian community in india . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists and people belonging to sexual minorities take part in a gay parade raising awareness ponnu arasu , who is also part of the queer movement , says there is a lot that needs to be done to sensitize people so there is a greater social acceptance . " legal victories are very important and they are a significant step .
but we all know that does not directly mean societal change .
so we still have a long way to go in terms of bringing about a change in the attitudes of people in general , in terms of the smallest units such as our natal families , our parents , to institutions such as schools , hospitals and government institutions such as courts . " many agree that the acceptance of gay marriages , in particular , will require a paradigm shift in the thinking of individuals , religious leaders , law making bodies and governments . as only a handful of countries have legally enshrined gay rights , for the rest of south asia and the developing world the delhi high court ruling is seen as a symbol of hope . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

zumwinkel welcomed the closing of the probe , which he said came to the conclusion that " any penal accusation against me is unfounded . "
" i regard this as a pleasant clarification , as a first-class termination of proceedings , " zumwinkel , who has denied any involvement in the spying , declared in bonn .
" it could not be better . "
the investigation was launched two years ago after deutsche telekom acknowledged that there were cases of misuse of call records in 2005 and 2006 .
germany 's journalists ' association djv criticized the outcome of the probe . " it is hard to imagine that the former telekom chiefs allegedly knew nothing about criminal interference into the freedom of the press , " djv chairman michael konken said .
eavesdropping scandal deutsche telekom ag was found to have monitored telephone records by senior executives and journalists to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws - and released a storm of public outrage .
the bonn prosecutors said on monday they were bringing charges against three telekom employees , including a leading security official .
the company has stressed that there is no suggestion that calls were tapped , but rather that call records detailing the time , participants and duration of calls were improperly monitored .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de belgium -pipe- 14.06.2010 belgian separatist party wins election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de wever wants in the end to split belgium parliamentary election results in belgium are expected to do little to ease decades of tensions between the wealthy flanders in the north of the country , and the poorer french-speaking walloons in the south . belgium has begun the search for a coalition government after right-wing flemish separatists won sunday 's parliamentary election .
final official results released by the national electoral commission on monday show that the new flemish alliance -lrb- nva -rrb- secured 27 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament , up from just eight seats in 2007 .
the nva , led by 39-year-old bart de wever , ultimately wants to split the wealthy dutch-speaking flanders in the north from belgium 's poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia in the south .
de wever passionately advocates the end of belgium , calling its six million dutch-speakers and 4.5 million francophones a " hopeless mismatch . "
linguistic disputes have long hounded belgium and dominated the election campaign .
but a split-up of belgium after this election is unlikely .
french-speaking rivals come close second the french-speaking socialists -lrb- ps -rrb- with 26 seats are now the country 's second largest party .
the christian democrats , of outgoing prime minister yves leterme secured just 17 seats .
together , the nva and the ps would have just over one third of all the seats in parliament .
if the two parties , despite massive ideological differences , formed a coalition , then 58-year old ps leader elio di rupo could end up becoming belgium 's first french-speaking prime minister since 1974 , as de wever has said he does not want the job .
" you do n't have to like each other to work together , " said di rupo .
“ we french-speaking belgians must take a step towards our dutch-speaking counterparts , and vice versa , if we are to negotiate issues that we can not avoid for our country . ”
due to linguistic , political and economic differences , belgium has had four governments and three prime ministers since 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elio di rupo will have to make hard decisions about whether to join the government another long wait would worry financial markets long talks could worry financial markets .
analysts are concerned months of coalition talks could delay cuts to state spending .
" if in september we see that a government is n't being formed , if we see the crisis is prolonged , then we could see a market reaction at that time , " said jacques de pover , an economist at dexia .
" the party that got the most votes is a separatist party and it throws into question over a long timeframe , over a few years and longer ... who 's going to pay that debt back , " said peter chatwell , a strategist at credit agricole .
nothing changes , for now leterme 's administration will remain in charge until a new government is formed .
king albert ii met with leterme on monday and formally accepted his government 's resignation .
the king also received the heads of both houses of parliament and begun holding talks with party leaders including de wever .
leterme is still expected to be in office when belgium takes on the six-month rotating presidency of the 27-member eu on july 1 .
the european commission has expressed confidence that belgium 's own political troubles will not affect its ability to handle eu policy matters during the six months .

the incident comes as taliban activity in the region has intensified and as insurgents inflict heavy losses on nato troops . two german soldiers were injured when their armored vehicle was hit by a blast from an improvised explosive device in the kunduz region of northern afghanistan .
one of the soldiers was seriously wounded , but is not in mortal danger , according to german military operations command in potsdam .
" the condition of the soldiers is stable , " a statement said .
both soldiers were evacuated from the scene by helicopter .
they were expected to be taken home to germany for further medical treatment in the next few days .
taliban militants have claimed responsibility for the attack .
week of fatalities afghan officials said that the vehicle had been travelling as part of a convoy patrolling the district of chardarah on sunday morning when the blast occurred .
an explosive device appeared to have been hidden at the side of the road , said district governor abdul wahid omarkhel .
the incident came at the end of a week in which more than 30 nato soldiers were killed in afghanistan .
kunduz , which is located in the relatively peaceful northern region , has seen increased taliban activity in the past few years .
germany has more than 4,000 troops stationed in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force .

but he and others are warning against exaggerating the significance of that victory . everybody loves a winner .
germany 's one-sided demolition of australia on sunday prompted frenetic celebrations in public viewing areas and parades of flag-flying , honking cars in the nation 's cities .
monday morning newspapers and television programs were hardly less euphoric in hailing the victory .
" this will be our world cup , " proclaimed germany 's leading tabloid bild .
" loew was proven right in all respects . "
former german national goalkeeper toni schumacher seconded those sentiments .
" despite all the criticism , loew did everything right , " the goalkeeping legend told the public television station zdf .
ironically , though , many of those now singing loew 's praises are the same ones who criticized the national team coach for sticking with out-of-form veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski just a few days previously .
and cooler heads are cautioning fans not to read too much into one convincing result .
one of them is loew himself .
no euphoria , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were smiles all around after the big win right after the match , the 50-year-old coach was doing his best to dampen expectations .
when asked if he thought he had done everything right , loew said no .
" we 've still got things to improve , " loew told reporters .
" we all know australia is n't the absolute measure of things , and of course we 'll face tougher tests in the tournament ... there 's no reason for euphoria . "
the coach did , however , take the opportunity to reiterate the logic behind starting podolski and klose , who both scored against australia .
" miroslav klose has been with us since 2002 and has scored 11 world cup goals , " loew said .
" -lsb- podolski -rsb- played his first tournament in 2004 and has always been one of our best players .
i know i can trust these players , even if they do have patchy stretches . "
indeed , after a wretched club season with cologne , podolski looked convincing .
he was an active and integrated part of germany 's midfield , and the shot that opened the scoring against australia was measured at 126 kilometers -lrb- 78 miles -rrb- per hour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose broke a long scoring drought with his header klose 's performance was more ambiguous .
the goal he headed in the first half showcased one of the striker 's strengths .
but the three sitters he missed were also indications of why he spent much of this past season on bayern munich 's bench .
on the other hand , youngsters thomas mueller and mesut oezil doubtlessly deserve the praise they are receiving , as germany 's offense clicked on all cylinders against the overmatched australians .
still open questions more football-savvy commentators agreed that the socceroos , a team loew had talked up before the game , were not the sort of opponents to truly test the squad .
" neither did the supposedly fearsome australians break any legs , nor did they pose much of an offensive threat after the fourth minute , " sports reporter christina goedecke wrote in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" after podolski made it 1-0 , their defensive strategy flew out the window . "
ahead of the world cup , many people worried whether sami khedira could replace the injured michael ballack in midfield and whether the central defense of per mertesacker and arne friedrich would hold up under pressure .
bildunterschrift : sami khedira was n't unduly troubled by australia 's luke wilkshire all three of those players looked good on sunday .
but then again , it would have been difficult not to look good against australia , who played without a true striker and then went down a in the first half .
the same goes for germany 's new no. 1 goalkeeper , 24-year-old manuel neuer , who was hardly tested in the match .
germany 's next game is against serbia on friday , and loew is already building them up as tougher foes .
but given their lackluster loss to ghana on sunday , the serbians may not pose a top-level test either .
indeed , germany may have to wait until the knock-out stages to find out how they measure up against the real competition for the title .
that 's the kind of problem , though , that all teams like to have .
so in the meantime , the press and fans can keep up the enthusiasm generated by the most impressive start of any team thus far in the world cup .
and loew 's new reputation as a footballing genius will survive at least for the next couple of days .

" -lsb- podolski -rsb- played his first tournament in 2004 and has always been one of our best players .
i know i can trust these players , even if they do have patchy stretches . "
indeed , after a wretched club season with cologne , podolski looked convincing .
he was an active and integrated part of germany 's midfield , and the shot that opened the scoring against australia was measured at 126 kilometers -lrb- 78 miles -rrb- per hour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose broke a long scoring drought with his header klose 's performance was more ambiguous .
the goal he headed in the first half showcased one of the striker 's strengths .
but the three sitters he missed were also indications of why he spent much of this past season on bayern munich 's bench .
on the other hand , youngsters thomas mueller and mesut oezil doubtlessly deserve the praise they are receiving , as germany 's offense clicked on all cylinders against the overmatched australians .
still open questions more football-savvy commentators agreed that the socceroos , a team loew had talked up before the game , were not the sort of opponents to truly test the squad .
" neither did the supposedly fearsome australians break any legs , nor did they pose much of an offensive threat after the fourth minute , " sports reporter christina goedecke wrote in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" after podolski made it 1-0 , their defensive strategy flew out the window . "
ahead of the world cup , many people worried whether sami khedira could replace the injured michael ballack in midfield and whether the central defense of per mertesacker and arne friedrich would hold up under pressure .
bildunterschrift : sami khedira was n't unduly troubled by australia 's luke wilkshire all three of those players looked good on sunday .
but then again , it would have been difficult not to look good against australia , who played without a true striker and then went down a in the first half .
the same goes for germany 's new no. 1 goalkeeper , 24-year-old manuel neuer , who was hardly tested in the match .
germany 's next game is against serbia on friday , and loew is already building them up as tougher foes .
but given their lackluster loss to ghana on sunday , the serbians may not pose a top-level test either .
indeed , germany may have to wait until the knock-out stages to find out how they measure up against the real competition for the title .
that 's the kind of problem , though , that all teams like to have .
so in the meantime , the press and fans can keep up the enthusiasm generated by the most impressive start of any team thus far in the world cup .
and loew 's new reputation as a footballing genius will survive at least for the next couple of days .

australia did n't have their best day .
at the same time a yellow card was against germany because of lack of effort .
it 's the small things that can stop a team in the next round .
each player has a job to do .
you must stay humble and ready for the next game . - malcolm , canada good article by nick amies .
it seems churlish to talk down the excellent display of the german national team against australia , but one must look at the early formline like any good horseracing enthusiast would .
this was a very poor australian team , reduced to ten men in the second half .
if germany can take out serbia without problems then i will probably become a believer , as i feel confident that they can beat ghana -lrb- weakened by the absence of michael essien -rrb- comfortably .
the german media -lrb- especially the three incredible tabloids -rrb- are whipping the good citizens up into a frenzy , but , i repeat , this early formline is flawed , without a doubt .
let 's therefore hang-on a bit and wait for serbia ? - fred , germany congratulations on winning the match versus australia with this first ideal performance and score of my beloved deutschland national team in this world cup .
podolski , who played a key role in this match , i had every confidence and very sure that you would head up your group and you would be number one player .
i hope that the next matches turn out to be as or more successful than this for you .
keep up the good performance !
podolski is the man of match and the icon of german football . - belkebir , algeria greetings from our rainbow listener 's club in kushtia here in bangladesh .
congratulations to the german football team for their win in their first match against australia in the worldcup 2010 .
we wish them every success . - wobaydullah , bangladesh to an oil-stained world two events brought grace elegance and happiness : winter games in canada and this week the “ happy ” world cup in south africa .
today australia will add more of the joy of sport to a sad world , whatever the result .
south africa led that charge in its opener and usa followed it last night . - neil , australia a poor mexican referee and no harry kewell .
the mexican referee deliberately missed a handball by a german player in the box early in the second half and should have awarded a penalty to australia .
the less said about the tim cahill incident by me the better .
this could be the death of australian football at the 2010 fifa world cup in south africa .
the socceroos are in a suicide mood .
my tip to win is spain because their country needs a morale boosting event for their poor economy and high unemployment in europe . - stuart , australia bildunterschrift : lukas podolski scored the opening goal in the early minutes of the match greetings from rajshahi , bangladesh .
i hope you are well .
i am very glad that my dream team germany made a good start in fifa world cup 2010 .
i enjoyed the match with my family members .
i hope they will be the champion . - salahuddin , bangladesh hats off to the german football team for winning their first game in the world cup .
i desire to see your team as the winner . - sayan , india australia was easy to beat .
now , lets see what 's next . - azura via facebook ghana and serbia will be the next victims ! - eugene via facebook australia will come back . - antoinette via facebook the dominance was obvious but it was started by two poles !
great job podolski and klose ! - christopher via facebook germany are a very good side .
no doubt aussiland will take this loss and should play better in the next round . - jason via facebook germany will meet other very good teams before winning the cup ! - ivy via facebook i agree that it was an amazing warm-up exercise for deutschland .
the aussies have tried their very best , for sure , but the difference between their ranks was simply too big .
let 's see what 's coming up next .

as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 opening blow-out earns loew redemption for a day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski paid back coach loew 's faith in him the biggest winner in germany 's emphatic 4-0 win over australia was embattled coach joachim loew .
but he and others are warning against exaggerating the significance of that victory . everybody loves a winner .
germany 's one-sided demolition of australia on sunday prompted frenetic celebrations in public viewing areas and parades of flag-flying , honking cars in the nation 's cities .
monday morning newspapers and television programs were hardly less euphoric in hailing the victory .
" this will be our world cup , " proclaimed germany 's leading tabloid bild .
" loew was proven right in all respects . "
former german national goalkeeper toni schumacher seconded those sentiments .
" despite all the criticism , loew did everything right , " the goalkeeping legend told the public television station zdf .
ironically , though , many of those now singing loew 's praises are the same ones who criticized the national team coach for sticking with out-of-form veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski just a few days previously .
and cooler heads are cautioning fans not to read too much into one convincing result .
one of them is loew himself .
no euphoria , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were smiles all around after the big win right after the match , the 50-year-old coach was doing his best to dampen expectations .
when asked if he thought he had done everything right , loew said no .
" we 've still got things to improve , " loew told reporters .
" we all know australia is n't the absolute measure of things , and of course we 'll face tougher tests in the tournament ... there 's no reason for euphoria . "
the coach did , however , take the opportunity to reiterate the logic behind starting podolski and klose , who both scored against australia .
" miroslav klose has been with us since 2002 and has scored 11 world cup goals , " loew said .
" -lsb- podolski -rsb- played his first tournament in 2004 and has always been one of our best players .
i know i can trust these players , even if they do have patchy stretches . "
indeed , after a wretched club season with cologne , podolski looked convincing .
he was an active and integrated part of germany 's midfield , and the shot that opened the scoring against australia was measured at 126 kilometers -lrb- 78 miles -rrb- per hour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose broke a long scoring drought with his header klose 's performance was more ambiguous .
the goal he headed in the first half showcased one of the striker 's strengths .
but the three sitters he missed were also indications of why he spent much of this past season on bayern munich 's bench .
on the other hand , youngsters thomas mueller and mesut oezil doubtlessly deserve the praise they are receiving , as germany 's offense clicked on all cylinders against the overmatched australians .
still open questions more football-savvy commentators agreed that the socceroos , a team loew had talked up before the game , were not the sort of opponents to truly test the squad .
" neither did the supposedly fearsome australians break any legs , nor did they pose much of an offensive threat after the fourth minute , " sports reporter christina goedecke wrote in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" after podolski made it 1-0 , their defensive strategy flew out the window . "
ahead of the world cup , many people worried whether sami khedira could replace the injured michael ballack in midfield and whether the central defense of per mertesacker and arne friedrich would hold up under pressure .
bildunterschrift : sami khedira was n't unduly troubled by australia 's luke wilkshire all three of those players looked good on sunday .
but then again , it would have been difficult not to look good against australia , who played without a true striker and then went down a in the first half .
the same goes for germany 's new no. 1 goalkeeper , 24-year-old manuel neuer , who was hardly tested in the match .
germany 's next game is against serbia on friday , and loew is already building them up as tougher foes .
but given their lackluster loss to ghana on sunday , the serbians may not pose a top-level test either .
indeed , germany may have to wait until the knock-out stages to find out how they measure up against the real competition for the title .
that 's the kind of problem , though , that all teams like to have .
so in the meantime , the press and fans can keep up the enthusiasm generated by the most impressive start of any team thus far in the world cup .
and loew 's new reputation as a footballing genius will survive at least for the next couple of days .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

zumwinkel welcomed the closing of the probe , which he said came to the conclusion that " any penal accusation against me is unfounded . "
" i regard this as a pleasant clarification , as a first-class termination of proceedings , " zumwinkel , who has denied any involvement in the spying , declared in bonn .
" it could not be better . "
the investigation was launched two years ago after deutsche telekom acknowledged that there were cases of misuse of call records in 2005 and 2006 .
germany 's journalists ' association djv criticized the outcome of the probe . " it is hard to imagine that the former telekom chiefs allegedly knew nothing about criminal interference into the freedom of the press , " djv chairman michael konken said .
eavesdropping scandal deutsche telekom ag was found to have monitored telephone records by senior executives and journalists to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws - and released a storm of public outrage .
the bonn prosecutors said on monday they were bringing charges against three telekom employees , including a leading security official .
the company has stressed that there is no suggestion that calls were tapped , but rather that call records detailing the time , participants and duration of calls were improperly monitored .

zumwinkel welcomed the closing of the probe , which he said came to the conclusion that " any penal accusation against me is unfounded . "
" i regard this as a pleasant clarification , as a first-class termination of proceedings , " zumwinkel , who has denied any involvement in the spying , declared in bonn .
" it could not be better . "
the investigation was launched two years ago after deutsche telekom acknowledged that there were cases of misuse of call records in 2005 and 2006 .
germany 's journalists ' association djv criticized the outcome of the probe . " it is hard to imagine that the former telekom chiefs allegedly knew nothing about criminal interference into the freedom of the press , " djv chairman michael konken said .
eavesdropping scandal deutsche telekom ag was found to have monitored telephone records by senior executives and journalists to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws - and released a storm of public outrage .
the bonn prosecutors said on monday they were bringing charges against three telekom employees , including a leading security official .
the company has stressed that there is no suggestion that calls were tapped , but rather that call records detailing the time , participants and duration of calls were improperly monitored .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry back to first page back 2/2 moscow fears ethnic instability on russia 's borders russia has its own interests of course .
as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

visitors are invited to walk all over them - and rethink energy use and climate change . it 's not your typical museum .
those who want to experience the ruhr atoll art project up close have to take a paddle boat to get there .
and touching the work wo n't draw nasty looks from some museum employees - quiet the opposite actually , it 's strongly encouraged . the 300-square-meter -lrb- about 3,200-square-foot -rrb- installation is particularly child-friendly , said the mastermind behind the project , artist norbert bauer .
his aim is to make art accessible . " i think art can and should always be fun , " he said .
" i 'm not going to take it all so deadly seriously . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer 's vision for the ruhr atoll was a product of runner 's endorphines , he said located in the middle of the six-kilometer-long -lrb- 3.7-mile -rrb- lake baldeney reservoir , bauer 's work includes an iceberg , an abandoned submarine , a teahouse and a rusty waterworks .
it was created because nearby essen and the surrounding ruhr region - historically , germany 's heart of heavy industry - were selected as europe 's 2010 capital of culture . " i ca n't say if it has great public significance , " said passer-by johannes limbeck of the atoll , " but it 's interesting to stand up here and look down at lake baldeney and see something other than little boats . " limbeck is one of three million visitors who make their way to essen 's reservoir each year to enjoy the water and the sunshine .
it 's precisely these unsuspecting lake-lovers that bauer wants to impact with his art . " art is there to be touched , " he said .
" i reach the people who do n't go to museums . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside , the submarine is an ominous symbol of war walk-in installations bauer explained that he had a vision for the atoll project while training for a marathon 15 years ago .
it remained just a picture in his head , however , until , a decade later , he invited artists to develop ideas for an island installation based on the theme " energy and movement . "
for the european cultural capital year , 24 models were selected , but funding only allowed for five to be realized . the artificial iceberg , positioned in lake baldeney as a clear reference to climate change , was developed by artist andreas kaiser , together with physicist and polar researcher lars kindermann .
it is a walk-in sculpture , with a research tent placed on top .
during the night , the tent lights up and realistic nature sounds - like thunder and ocean waves - are broadcast from it . nearby , the grey tower of a stranded submarine , designed by artist andreas kaufmann and media expert hans ullrich reck , juts out of the water .
it is a symbol of the conflicts and wars that are fought over energy resources , said ruhr atoll spokesman holger kruessmann . " but the effect when we enter the submarine is that this weapon is transformed into a chapel on the inside ; it practically seems like a church , " he explained . on the inside of the submarine 's tower , the words " i can , because i want to , which i have to " are spelled out in a collage made of hundreds of press photographs .
the resulting mosaic resembles a stained-glass window in a church . bildunterschrift : the inside of the submarine resembles stained-glass windows island of absurdity norbert bauer 's favorite part of the ruhr atoll is the island called " project to preserve natural resources , " designed by renowned russian installation artist ilya kabakov .
the island is a piece of absurdistan , joked bauer .
kabakov has turned the renewable energy discussion on its head - in a ridiculous way , he added . on the island , water is pumped through rusty pipes and boilers , then passes through a series of whimsical-looking filters that are powered by wind energy and diesel motors .
the water then flows through a mock laboratory before landing once again in the lake . " it was really fun putting it together with a mechanic , " said bauer . spokesman kruessmann said the great irony behind the model island is that there 's plenty of rattling , clanging and moving parts that give the impression of productivity , " but really nothing happens except that the water is transferred from left to right . " at the end of the year , when essen 's title as culture capital is passed on , the island will be transported to different waters .
norbert bauer is in the process of looking for buyers for the various objects that make up the ruhr atoll .
kabakov 's absurd island is going for around 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 360,000 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : kabakov 's island is a picture of ironic absurdity author : bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- photos : per henriksen editor : sue cox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

visitors are invited to walk all over them - and rethink energy use and climate change . it 's not your typical museum .
those who want to experience the ruhr atoll art project up close have to take a paddle boat to get there .
and touching the work wo n't draw nasty looks from some museum employees - quiet the opposite actually , it 's strongly encouraged . the 300-square-meter -lrb- about 3,200-square-foot -rrb- installation is particularly child-friendly , said the mastermind behind the project , artist norbert bauer .

it was created because nearby essen and the surrounding ruhr region - historically , germany 's heart of heavy industry - were selected as europe 's 2010 capital of culture . " i ca n't say if it has great public significance , " said passer-by johannes limbeck of the atoll , " but it 's interesting to stand up here and look down at lake baldeney and see something other than little boats .

for the european cultural capital year , 24 models were selected , but funding only allowed for five to be realized . the artificial iceberg , positioned in lake baldeney as a clear reference to climate change , was developed by artist andreas kaiser , together with physicist and polar researcher lars kindermann .
it is a walk-in sculpture , with a research tent placed on top .
during the night , the tent lights up and realistic nature sounds - like thunder and ocean waves - are broadcast from it . nearby , the grey tower of a stranded submarine , designed by artist andreas kaufmann and media expert hans ullrich reck , juts out of the water .
it is a symbol of the conflicts and wars that are fought over energy resources , said ruhr atoll spokesman holger kruessmann . " but the effect when we enter the submarine is that this weapon is transformed into a chapel on the inside ; it practically seems like a church , " he explained . on the inside of the submarine 's tower , the words " i can , because i want to , which i have to " are spelled out in a collage made of hundreds of press photographs .

kabakov has turned the renewable energy discussion on its head - in a ridiculous way , he added . on the island , water is pumped through rusty pipes and boilers , then passes through a series of whimsical-looking filters that are powered by wind energy and diesel motors .
the water then flows through a mock laboratory before landing once again in the lake . " it was really fun putting it together with a mechanic , " said bauer . spokesman kruessmann said the great irony behind the model island is that there 's plenty of rattling , clanging and moving parts that give the impression of productivity , " but really nothing happens except that the water is transferred from left to right . " at the end of the year , when essen 's title as culture capital is passed on , the island will be transported to different waters .
norbert bauer is in the process of looking for buyers for the various objects that make up the ruhr atoll .

visitors are invited to walk all over them - and rethink energy use and climate change . it 's not your typical museum .
those who want to experience the ruhr atoll art project up close have to take a paddle boat to get there .
and touching the work wo n't draw nasty looks from some museum employees - quiet the opposite actually , it 's strongly encouraged . the 300-square-meter -lrb- about 3,200-square-foot -rrb- installation is particularly child-friendly , said the mastermind behind the project , artist norbert bauer .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer 's vision for the ruhr atoll was a product of runner 's endorphines , he said located in the middle of the six-kilometer-long -lrb- 3.7-mile -rrb- lake baldeney reservoir , bauer 's work includes an iceberg , an abandoned submarine , a teahouse and a rusty waterworks .
it was created because nearby essen and the surrounding ruhr region - historically , germany 's heart of heavy industry - were selected as europe 's 2010 capital of culture . " i ca n't say if it has great public significance , " said passer-by johannes limbeck of the atoll , " but it 's interesting to stand up here and look down at lake baldeney and see something other than little boats .

it remained just a picture in his head , however , until , a decade later , he invited artists to develop ideas for an island installation based on the theme " energy and movement . "
for the european cultural capital year , 24 models were selected , but funding only allowed for five to be realized . the artificial iceberg , positioned in lake baldeney as a clear reference to climate change , was developed by artist andreas kaiser , together with physicist and polar researcher lars kindermann .
it is a walk-in sculpture , with a research tent placed on top .
during the night , the tent lights up and realistic nature sounds - like thunder and ocean waves - are broadcast from it . nearby , the grey tower of a stranded submarine , designed by artist andreas kaufmann and media expert hans ullrich reck , juts out of the water .
it is a symbol of the conflicts and wars that are fought over energy resources , said ruhr atoll spokesman holger kruessmann . " but the effect when we enter the submarine is that this weapon is transformed into a chapel on the inside ; it practically seems like a church , " he explained . on the inside of the submarine 's tower , the words " i can , because i want to , which i have to " are spelled out in a collage made of hundreds of press photographs .

kabakov has turned the renewable energy discussion on its head - in a ridiculous way , he added . on the island , water is pumped through rusty pipes and boilers , then passes through a series of whimsical-looking filters that are powered by wind energy and diesel motors .
the water then flows through a mock laboratory before landing once again in the lake . " it was really fun putting it together with a mechanic , " said bauer . spokesman kruessmann said the great irony behind the model island is that there 's plenty of rattling , clanging and moving parts that give the impression of productivity , " but really nothing happens except that the water is transferred from left to right . " at the end of the year , when essen 's title as culture capital is passed on , the island will be transported to different waters .

the water then flows through a mock laboratory before landing once again in the lake .

" at the end of the year , when essen 's title as culture capital is passed on , the island will be transported to different waters .

" i reach the people who do n't go to museums . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside , the submarine is an ominous symbol of war walk-in installations bauer explained that he had a vision for the atoll project while training for a marathon 15 years ago .
it remained just a picture in his head , however , until , a decade later , he invited artists to develop ideas for an island installation based on the theme " energy and movement . "
for the european cultural capital year , 24 models were selected , but funding only allowed for five to be realized . the artificial iceberg , positioned in lake baldeney as a clear reference to climate change , was developed by artist andreas kaiser , together with physicist and polar researcher lars kindermann .
it is a walk-in sculpture , with a research tent placed on top .
during the night , the tent lights up and realistic nature sounds - like thunder and ocean waves - are broadcast from it . nearby , the grey tower of a stranded submarine , designed by artist andreas kaufmann and media expert hans ullrich reck , juts out of the water .
it is a symbol of the conflicts and wars that are fought over energy resources , said ruhr atoll spokesman holger kruessmann . " but the effect when we enter the submarine is that this weapon is transformed into a chapel on the inside ; it practically seems like a church , " he explained . on the inside of the submarine 's tower , the words " i can , because i want to , which i have to " are spelled out in a collage made of hundreds of press photographs .
the resulting mosaic resembles a stained-glass window in a church . bildunterschrift : the inside of the submarine resembles stained-glass windows island of absurdity norbert bauer 's favorite part of the ruhr atoll is the island called " project to preserve natural resources , " designed by renowned russian installation artist ilya kabakov .
the island is a piece of absurdistan , joked bauer .
kabakov has turned the renewable energy discussion on its head - in a ridiculous way , he added . on the island , water is pumped through rusty pipes and boilers , then passes through a series of whimsical-looking filters that are powered by wind energy and diesel motors .
the water then flows through a mock laboratory before landing once again in the lake . " it was really fun putting it together with a mechanic , " said bauer . spokesman kruessmann said the great irony behind the model island is that there 's plenty of rattling , clanging and moving parts that give the impression of productivity , " but really nothing happens except that the water is transferred from left to right . " at the end of the year , when essen 's title as culture capital is passed on , the island will be transported to different waters .
norbert bauer is in the process of looking for buyers for the various objects that make up the ruhr atoll .
kabakov 's absurd island is going for around 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 360,000 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : kabakov 's island is a picture of ironic absurdity author : bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- photos : per henriksen editor : sue cox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .

as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .

the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .

regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

it 's the small things that can stop a team in the next round .
each player has a job to do .
you must stay humble and ready for the next game . - malcolm , canada good article by nick amies .
it seems churlish to talk down the excellent display of the german national team against australia , but one must look at the early formline like any good horseracing enthusiast would .
this was a very poor australian team , reduced to ten men in the second half .
if germany can take out serbia without problems then i will probably become a believer , as i feel confident that they can beat ghana -lrb- weakened by the absence of michael essien -rrb- comfortably .
the german media -lrb- especially the three incredible tabloids -rrb- are whipping the good citizens up into a frenzy , but , i repeat , this early formline is flawed , without a doubt .
let 's therefore hang-on a bit and wait for serbia ? - fred , germany congratulations on winning the match versus australia with this first ideal performance and score of my beloved deutschland national team in this world cup .

however , some still preach caution . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
australia did n't have their best day .
at the same time a yellow card was against germany because of lack of effort .
it 's the small things that can stop a team in the next round .
each player has a job to do .
you must stay humble and ready for the next game . - malcolm , canada good article by nick amies .
it seems churlish to talk down the excellent display of the german national team against australia , but one must look at the early formline like any good horseracing enthusiast would .
this was a very poor australian team , reduced to ten men in the second half .
if germany can take out serbia without problems then i will probably become a believer , as i feel confident that they can beat ghana -lrb- weakened by the absence of michael essien -rrb- comfortably .
the german media -lrb- especially the three incredible tabloids -rrb- are whipping the good citizens up into a frenzy , but , i repeat , this early formline is flawed , without a doubt .
let 's therefore hang-on a bit and wait for serbia ? - fred , germany congratulations on winning the match versus australia with this first ideal performance and score of my beloved deutschland national team in this world cup .
podolski , who played a key role in this match , i had every confidence and very sure that you would head up your group and you would be number one player .
i hope that the next matches turn out to be as or more successful than this for you .
keep up the good performance !
podolski is the man of match and the icon of german football . - belkebir , algeria greetings from our rainbow listener 's club in kushtia here in bangladesh .
congratulations to the german football team for their win in their first match against australia in the worldcup 2010 .
we wish them every success . - wobaydullah , bangladesh to an oil-stained world two events brought grace elegance and happiness : winter games in canada and this week the “ happy ” world cup in south africa .
today australia will add more of the joy of sport to a sad world , whatever the result .
south africa led that charge in its opener and usa followed it last night . - neil , australia a poor mexican referee and no harry kewell .
the mexican referee deliberately missed a handball by a german player in the box early in the second half and should have awarded a penalty to australia .
the less said about the tim cahill incident by me the better .
this could be the death of australian football at the 2010 fifa world cup in south africa .
the socceroos are in a suicide mood .
my tip to win is spain because their country needs a morale boosting event for their poor economy and high unemployment in europe . - stuart , australia bildunterschrift : lukas podolski scored the opening goal in the early minutes of the match greetings from rajshahi , bangladesh .
i hope you are well .
i am very glad that my dream team germany made a good start in fifa world cup 2010 .

i hope they will be the champion . - salahuddin , bangladesh hats off to the german football team for winning their first game in the world cup .

but he and others are warning against exaggerating the significance of that victory . everybody loves a winner .
germany 's one-sided demolition of australia on sunday prompted frenetic celebrations in public viewing areas and parades of flag-flying , honking cars in the nation 's cities .
monday morning newspapers and television programs were hardly less euphoric in hailing the victory .
" this will be our world cup , " proclaimed germany 's leading tabloid bild .
" loew was proven right in all respects . "
former german national goalkeeper toni schumacher seconded those sentiments .
" despite all the criticism , loew did everything right , " the goalkeeping legend told the public television station zdf .
ironically , though , many of those now singing loew 's praises are the same ones who criticized the national team coach for sticking with out-of-form veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski just a few days previously .
and cooler heads are cautioning fans not to read too much into one convincing result .
one of them is loew himself .
no euphoria , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were smiles all around after the big win right after the match , the 50-year-old coach was doing his best to dampen expectations .
when asked if he thought he had done everything right , loew said no .
" we 've still got things to improve , " loew told reporters .
" we all know australia is n't the absolute measure of things , and of course we 'll face tougher tests in the tournament ... there 's no reason for euphoria . "
the coach did , however , take the opportunity to reiterate the logic behind starting podolski and klose , who both scored against australia .
" miroslav klose has been with us since 2002 and has scored 11 world cup goals , " loew said .
" -lsb- podolski -rsb- played his first tournament in 2004 and has always been one of our best players .
i know i can trust these players , even if they do have patchy stretches . "
indeed , after a wretched club season with cologne , podolski looked convincing .
he was an active and integrated part of germany 's midfield , and the shot that opened the scoring against australia was measured at 126 kilometers -lrb- 78 miles -rrb- per hour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose broke a long scoring drought with his header klose 's performance was more ambiguous .
the goal he headed in the first half showcased one of the striker 's strengths .
but the three sitters he missed were also indications of why he spent much of this past season on bayern munich 's bench .
on the other hand , youngsters thomas mueller and mesut oezil doubtlessly deserve the praise they are receiving , as germany 's offense clicked on all cylinders against the overmatched australians .
still open questions more football-savvy commentators agreed that the socceroos , a team loew had talked up before the game , were not the sort of opponents to truly test the squad .
" neither did the supposedly fearsome australians break any legs , nor did they pose much of an offensive threat after the fourth minute , " sports reporter christina goedecke wrote in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" after podolski made it 1-0 , their defensive strategy flew out the window . "
ahead of the world cup , many people worried whether sami khedira could replace the injured michael ballack in midfield and whether the central defense of per mertesacker and arne friedrich would hold up under pressure .
bildunterschrift : sami khedira was n't unduly troubled by australia 's luke wilkshire all three of those players looked good on sunday .
but then again , it would have been difficult not to look good against australia , who played without a true striker and then went down a in the first half .
the same goes for germany 's new no. 1 goalkeeper , 24-year-old manuel neuer , who was hardly tested in the match .
germany 's next game is against serbia on friday , and loew is already building them up as tougher foes .
but given their lackluster loss to ghana on sunday , the serbians may not pose a top-level test either .
indeed , germany may have to wait until the knock-out stages to find out how they measure up against the real competition for the title .
that 's the kind of problem , though , that all teams like to have .
so in the meantime , the press and fans can keep up the enthusiasm generated by the most impressive start of any team thus far in the world cup .
and loew 's new reputation as a footballing genius will survive at least for the next couple of days .

germany 's one-sided demolition of australia on sunday prompted frenetic celebrations in public viewing areas and parades of flag-flying , honking cars in the nation 's cities .
monday morning newspapers and television programs were hardly less euphoric in hailing the victory .
" this will be our world cup , " proclaimed germany 's leading tabloid bild .
" loew was proven right in all respects . "
former german national goalkeeper toni schumacher seconded those sentiments .
" despite all the criticism , loew did everything right , " the goalkeeping legend told the public television station zdf .
ironically , though , many of those now singing loew 's praises are the same ones who criticized the national team coach for sticking with out-of-form veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski just a few days previously .
and cooler heads are cautioning fans not to read too much into one convincing result .
one of them is loew himself .
no euphoria , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were smiles all around after the big win right after the match , the 50-year-old coach was doing his best to dampen expectations .

" we all know australia is n't the absolute measure of things , and of course we 'll face tougher tests in the tournament ... there 's no reason for euphoria . "

the incident comes as taliban activity in the region has intensified and as insurgents inflict heavy losses on nato troops . two german soldiers were injured when their armored vehicle was hit by a blast from an improvised explosive device in the kunduz region of northern afghanistan .
one of the soldiers was seriously wounded , but is not in mortal danger , according to german military operations command in potsdam .
" the condition of the soldiers is stable , " a statement said .
both soldiers were evacuated from the scene by helicopter .
they were expected to be taken home to germany for further medical treatment in the next few days .
taliban militants have claimed responsibility for the attack .
week of fatalities afghan officials said that the vehicle had been travelling as part of a convoy patrolling the district of chardarah on sunday morning when the blast occurred .
an explosive device appeared to have been hidden at the side of the road , said district governor abdul wahid omarkhel .
the incident came at the end of a week in which more than 30 nato soldiers were killed in afghanistan .
kunduz , which is located in the relatively peaceful northern region , has seen increased taliban activity in the past few years .
germany has more than 4,000 troops stationed in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 the continent has its world cup , but can an african nation actually win it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's asamoah gyan scored the goal that gave africa its first win in the tournament the world cup had to wait for 82 years before it could come to an african nation .
now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de belgium -pipe- 14.06.2010 belgian separatist party wins election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de wever wants in the end to split belgium parliamentary election results in belgium are expected to do little to ease decades of tensions between the wealthy flanders in the north of the country , and the poorer french-speaking walloons in the south . belgium has begun the search for a coalition government after right-wing flemish separatists won sunday 's parliamentary election .
final official results released by the national electoral commission on monday show that the new flemish alliance -lrb- nva -rrb- secured 27 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament , up from just eight seats in 2007 .
the nva , led by 39-year-old bart de wever , ultimately wants to split the wealthy dutch-speaking flanders in the north from belgium 's poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia in the south .
de wever passionately advocates the end of belgium , calling its six million dutch-speakers and 4.5 million francophones a " hopeless mismatch . "
linguistic disputes have long hounded belgium and dominated the election campaign .
but a split-up of belgium after this election is unlikely .
french-speaking rivals come close second the french-speaking socialists -lrb- ps -rrb- with 26 seats are now the country 's second largest party .
the christian democrats , of outgoing prime minister yves leterme secured just 17 seats .
together , the nva and the ps would have just over one third of all the seats in parliament .
if the two parties , despite massive ideological differences , formed a coalition , then 58-year old ps leader elio di rupo could end up becoming belgium 's first french-speaking prime minister since 1974 , as de wever has said he does not want the job .
" you do n't have to like each other to work together , " said di rupo .
“ we french-speaking belgians must take a step towards our dutch-speaking counterparts , and vice versa , if we are to negotiate issues that we can not avoid for our country . ”
due to linguistic , political and economic differences , belgium has had four governments and three prime ministers since 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elio di rupo will have to make hard decisions about whether to join the government another long wait would worry financial markets long talks could worry financial markets .
analysts are concerned months of coalition talks could delay cuts to state spending .
" if in september we see that a government is n't being formed , if we see the crisis is prolonged , then we could see a market reaction at that time , " said jacques de pover , an economist at dexia .
" the party that got the most votes is a separatist party and it throws into question over a long timeframe , over a few years and longer ... who 's going to pay that debt back , " said peter chatwell , a strategist at credit agricole .
nothing changes , for now leterme 's administration will remain in charge until a new government is formed .
king albert ii met with leterme on monday and formally accepted his government 's resignation .
the king also received the heads of both houses of parliament and begun holding talks with party leaders including de wever .
leterme is still expected to be in office when belgium takes on the six-month rotating presidency of the 27-member eu on july 1 .
the european commission has expressed confidence that belgium 's own political troubles will not affect its ability to handle eu policy matters during the six months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 14.06.2010 asia needs green tigers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's largest co2 emitter at the recent world economic forum on east asia in vietnam , deutsche welle brought together governments and the corporate sector to debate the prospects of green growth in asia . polluted air , a lack of drinking water and overcrowded cities : it is well known that rapid economic growth has brought massive environmental challenges to the asian continent .
frans muller , a board member of germany 's metro group , admitted that these are serious problems , but he also pointed out that growing economies have an edge when it comes to being innovative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus schwab speaks at the world economic forum on east asia " i think asia has not only a challenge , but also in this respect an enormous chance , " muller said .
" what you see is that more and more international companies establish their r & d centers in asia , particularly china , korea and japan ; and that a lot of technologies that are now a strength of asia , are linked to green technologies .
interfaces are possible : there are a lot of opportunities between the it sector in asia , which is very strong , and green technologies .
so there are a lot of opportunities that the green challenge will also bring green technology growth to industries in asia . "
governments lead the way in order to tap this potential , the role of governments is crucial .
many asian governments such as china and south korea have made green growth a policy priority .
south korea 's deputy environment minister yoon jong-soo explained what his administration has been doing to mobilize the citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese continue to rely heavily on highly polluting coal ...
he gave three examples : " one is the green start movement .
it is a nationwide campaign : we have to adopt a green lifestyle .
the second is the carbon point system : when households reduce carbon emissions and save energy , they get rewards in the form of cash or coupons .
the third is a ' carbon labeling ' system .
it provides information how much carbon dioxide has been emitted in the course of production , transportation and disposal of goods .
incentives are very important , rather than regulations . "
oil subsidies prevent innovation but stuart dean , who heads general electric in the asean region , cautioned that other policies in asia hinder growth in the green sectors .

russia , along with the european union , has agreed to send humanitarian aid . tens of thousands of uzbeks have fled the area for neighbouring uzbekistan , with several thousand more waiting to get in . no troops for now even if russia opts to not get involved in the conflict , peace troops could be sent by the collective security treaty organization , a regional defense block led by russia .

kyrgyzstan has not yet done enough to calm the situation by itself , said chairman nikolai patrushev .
but , he said , other measures to help kyrgyzstan solve the crisis are underway . " we hope that these measures will be approved shortly by the presidents of the member states and that we 'll soon start working , " said patruchev . in the meantime , the situation in osh and jalalabad appears to be stabilizing , but reports of looting continue .

final official results released by the national electoral commission on monday show that the new flemish alliance -lrb- nva -rrb- secured 27 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament , up from just eight seats in 2007 .
the nva , led by 39-year-old bart de wever , ultimately wants to split the wealthy dutch-speaking flanders in the north from belgium 's poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia in the south .
de wever passionately advocates the end of belgium , calling its six million dutch-speakers and 4.5 million francophones a " hopeless mismatch . "
linguistic disputes have long hounded belgium and dominated the election campaign .
but a split-up of belgium after this election is unlikely .
french-speaking rivals come close second the french-speaking socialists -lrb- ps -rrb- with 26 seats are now the country 's second largest party .
the christian democrats , of outgoing prime minister yves leterme secured just 17 seats .
together , the nva and the ps would have just over one third of all the seats in parliament .
if the two parties , despite massive ideological differences , formed a coalition , then 58-year old ps leader elio di rupo could end up becoming belgium 's first french-speaking prime minister since 1974 , as de wever has said he does not want the job .
" you do n't have to like each other to work together , " said di rupo .
“ we french-speaking belgians must take a step towards our dutch-speaking counterparts , and vice versa , if we are to negotiate issues that we can not avoid for our country . ”
due to linguistic , political and economic differences , belgium has had four governments and three prime ministers since 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elio di rupo will have to make hard decisions about whether to join the government another long wait would worry financial markets long talks could worry financial markets .
analysts are concerned months of coalition talks could delay cuts to state spending .
" if in september we see that a government is n't being formed , if we see the crisis is prolonged , then we could see a market reaction at that time , " said jacques de pover , an economist at dexia .
" the party that got the most votes is a separatist party and it throws into question over a long timeframe , over a few years and longer ... who 's going to pay that debt back , " said peter chatwell , a strategist at credit agricole .
nothing changes , for now leterme 's administration will remain in charge until a new government is formed .
king albert ii met with leterme on monday and formally accepted his government 's resignation .
the king also received the heads of both houses of parliament and begun holding talks with party leaders including de wever .
leterme is still expected to be in office when belgium takes on the six-month rotating presidency of the 27-member eu on july 1 .
the european commission has expressed confidence that belgium 's own political troubles will not affect its ability to handle eu policy matters during the six months .

zumwinkel welcomed the closing of the probe , which he said came to the conclusion that " any penal accusation against me is unfounded . "
" i regard this as a pleasant clarification , as a first-class termination of proceedings , " zumwinkel , who has denied any involvement in the spying , declared in bonn .
" it could not be better . "
the investigation was launched two years ago after deutsche telekom acknowledged that there were cases of misuse of call records in 2005 and 2006 .
germany 's journalists ' association djv criticized the outcome of the probe . " it is hard to imagine that the former telekom chiefs allegedly knew nothing about criminal interference into the freedom of the press , " djv chairman michael konken said .
eavesdropping scandal deutsche telekom ag was found to have monitored telephone records by senior executives and journalists to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws - and released a storm of public outrage .
the bonn prosecutors said on monday they were bringing charges against three telekom employees , including a leading security official .
the company has stressed that there is no suggestion that calls were tapped , but rather that call records detailing the time , participants and duration of calls were improperly monitored .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 the continent has its world cup , but can an african nation actually win it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's asamoah gyan scored the goal that gave africa its first win in the tournament the world cup had to wait for 82 years before it could come to an african nation .
now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.06.2010 indian gays long for greater social acceptance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lesbian , gay , bi-sexual and transgender community has been fighting for legal rights almost a year ago , the gay and lesbian community in india celebrated a landmark ruling .
new delhi 's high court decriminalized homosexuality by striking down parts of the country 's colonial-era penal code .
but the fight has not stopped there .
the community is struggling for greater social acceptance and full legal rights . after last year 's historic verdict that ended state-sanctioned homophobia , india 's fledgling gay community is working to ensure that the delhi high court 's decisive verdict is not overturned in the supreme court .
but simultaneously , the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender or lgbt community as it is widely known , has begun fighting for legal rights .
gautam bhan , a prominent gay activist , outlines the roadmap ahead : " we have long said as part of the gay rights movement that the victory in the delhi high court last july , was not the victory that ended a battle .
it was a victory that began one .
i mean really the fight has started now .
decriminalization was the first step .
there is still no positive legal inclusion for gays and lesbians in the indian legal framework .
for example there is no non-discrimination in employment , or in health benefits or taxation or in joint home loans or in the right to visit your partner when they are sick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters celebrate in delhi following the landmark ruling on july 2 , 2009 gay rights and law indian law does not recognize same-sex marriages , nor does it provide for civil unions .
in fact the government is planning to bring in legislation under which gay and lesbian couples can not have children born with the help of an indian surrogate mother .
it is these exclusions that the lgbt community is striving to abolish . " there is a range of exclusions that are built into the system at this point , " says bhan .
" marriage , adoption and family law is well known among this range of exclusions .
but i think particularly critical to us are exclusions based on livelihood , work and employment .
it is still very difficult for transgender to get identification .
hiring practices : people getting fired and being unable to come out at work .
people still fear for their physical safety from the police , even though that has begun to change , so i think in a range of these - from personal , to the private and to intimate , there are still many structural constraints facing the gay-lesbian community in india . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists and people belonging to sexual minorities take part in a gay parade raising awareness ponnu arasu , who is also part of the queer movement , says there is a lot that needs to be done to sensitize people so there is a greater social acceptance . " legal victories are very important and they are a significant step .
but we all know that does not directly mean societal change .
so we still have a long way to go in terms of bringing about a change in the attitudes of people in general , in terms of the smallest units such as our natal families , our parents , to institutions such as schools , hospitals and government institutions such as courts . " many agree that the acceptance of gay marriages , in particular , will require a paradigm shift in the thinking of individuals , religious leaders , law making bodies and governments . as only a handful of countries have legally enshrined gay rights , for the rest of south asia and the developing world the delhi high court ruling is seen as a symbol of hope . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

zumwinkel welcomed the closing of the probe , which he said came to the conclusion that " any penal accusation against me is unfounded . "
" i regard this as a pleasant clarification , as a first-class termination of proceedings , " zumwinkel , who has denied any involvement in the spying , declared in bonn .
" it could not be better . "
the investigation was launched two years ago after deutsche telekom acknowledged that there were cases of misuse of call records in 2005 and 2006 .
germany 's journalists ' association djv criticized the outcome of the probe . " it is hard to imagine that the former telekom chiefs allegedly knew nothing about criminal interference into the freedom of the press , " djv chairman michael konken said .
eavesdropping scandal deutsche telekom ag was found to have monitored telephone records by senior executives and journalists to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws - and released a storm of public outrage .
the bonn prosecutors said on monday they were bringing charges against three telekom employees , including a leading security official .
the company has stressed that there is no suggestion that calls were tapped , but rather that call records detailing the time , participants and duration of calls were improperly monitored .

in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .
daisuke matsui crossed from the right wing to the opposite side of the goal and found keisuke honda all alone .
honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .
a misguided header resulted in an own-goal , giving the netherlands the only goal they needed on their way to a 2-0 win .

dutch striker robin van persie took a pass near the end line and crossed the ball in front of the goal .
danish defender daniel agger leapt for the ball to try and clear it , but it sailed over his head , leaving poulsen to head it out of the area .
but instead of clearing the ball , poulsen 's header glanced off agger 's back and rolled into the corner of his own goal .
danish keeper thomas sorensen was standing on the other side of the net and could only watch the ball trickle over the line .
the second goal for the netherlands involved a bit of luck as well .
dutch striker eljero elia took a shot from close range , which sorensen managed to get a hand on and deflect into the post .
the ball bounced back into play , where elia 's teammate dirk kuyt cleanly sent the rebound to the back of the net for the game 's final goal .
the netherlands and japan are tied on points at the top of group e , with the dutch having the better goal differential .

in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .
daisuke matsui crossed from the right wing to the opposite side of the goal and found keisuke honda all alone .
honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .
a misguided header resulted in an own-goal , giving the netherlands the only goal they needed on their way to a 2-0 win .
bildunterschrift : simon poulsen 's header -lrb- right -rrb- deflected off daniel agger -lrb- center -rrb- and rolled into the danish goal just after both teams returned to the pitch following a scoreless first half , the netherlands had possession and were moving the ball down the pitch .
dutch striker robin van persie took a pass near the end line and crossed the ball in front of the goal .
danish defender daniel agger leapt for the ball to try and clear it , but it sailed over his head , leaving poulsen to head it out of the area .
but instead of clearing the ball , poulsen 's header glanced off agger 's back and rolled into the corner of his own goal .
danish keeper thomas sorensen was standing on the other side of the net and could only watch the ball trickle over the line .
the second goal for the netherlands involved a bit of luck as well .
dutch striker eljero elia took a shot from close range , which sorensen managed to get a hand on and deflect into the post .
the ball bounced back into play , where elia 's teammate dirk kuyt cleanly sent the rebound to the back of the net for the game 's final goal .
the netherlands and japan are tied on points at the top of group e , with the dutch having the better goal differential .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

frans muller , a board member of germany 's metro group , admitted that these are serious problems , but he also pointed out that growing economies have an edge when it comes to being innovative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus schwab speaks at the world economic forum on east asia " i think asia has not only a challenge , but also in this respect an enormous chance , " muller said .
" what you see is that more and more international companies establish their r & d centers in asia , particularly china , korea and japan ; and that a lot of technologies that are now a strength of asia , are linked to green technologies .
interfaces are possible : there are a lot of opportunities between the it sector in asia , which is very strong , and green technologies .
so there are a lot of opportunities that the green challenge will also bring green technology growth to industries in asia . "
governments lead the way in order to tap this potential , the role of governments is crucial .
many asian governments such as china and south korea have made green growth a policy priority .
south korea 's deputy environment minister yoon jong-soo explained what his administration has been doing to mobilize the citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese continue to rely heavily on highly polluting coal ...
he gave three examples : " one is the green start movement .
it is a nationwide campaign : we have to adopt a green lifestyle .
the second is the carbon point system : when households reduce carbon emissions and save energy , they get rewards in the form of cash or coupons .
the third is a ' carbon labeling ' system .
it provides information how much carbon dioxide has been emitted in the course of production , transportation and disposal of goods .
incentives are very important , rather than regulations . "
oil subsidies prevent innovation but stuart dean , who heads general electric in the asean region , cautioned that other policies in asia hinder growth in the green sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but they also have become leading producers in solar technology " i think one of the areas that really need to be addressed early on is the area of subsidies for fossil fuels .
at least half of the countries in asia still have subsidies for fossil fuel , which then affect the pricing of electricity .
we recognize that there are socio-economic groups that benefit from those subsidies ; but i think it is also clear there are better ways to do income redistribution than subsidizing everyone 's use of fossil fuels . "
dean said europe became a leader in alternative energies only because high taxes made oil products expensive .
both industry and government representatives agreed that there is enormous potential for public-private partnerships in the realm of green growth .
with the right leadership , asia 's booming economies might soon become known as the " green tigers " .

regular kyrgyz troops do not appear to be capable of keeping the peace as violence against ethnic uzbeks have left at least 124 people dead .
there have even been accusations that krygyz troops are taking sides with the armed gangs , who have been killing and looting for three days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otunbayeva has called on russia to help roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , has asked russia to intervene and send troops to the area .
but moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
russia , along with the european union , has agreed to send humanitarian aid . tens of thousands of uzbeks have fled the area for neighbouring uzbekistan , with several thousand more waiting to get in . no troops for now even if russia opts to not get involved in the conflict , peace troops could be sent by the collective security treaty organization , a regional defense block led by russia .
but at a meeting in moscow on monday , the member states decided not to send troops for now .
kyrgyzstan has not yet done enough to calm the situation by itself , said chairman nikolai patrushev .
but , he said , other measures to help kyrgyzstan solve the crisis are underway . " we hope that these measures will be approved shortly by the presidents of the member states and that we 'll soon start working , " said patruchev . in the meantime , the situation in osh and jalalabad appears to be stabilizing , but reports of looting continue .

as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .

frans muller , a board member of germany 's metro group , admitted that these are serious problems , but he also pointed out that growing economies have an edge when it comes to being innovative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus schwab speaks at the world economic forum on east asia " i think asia has not only a challenge , but also in this respect an enormous chance , " muller said .
" what you see is that more and more international companies establish their r & d centers in asia , particularly china , korea and japan ; and that a lot of technologies that are now a strength of asia , are linked to green technologies .
interfaces are possible : there are a lot of opportunities between the it sector in asia , which is very strong , and green technologies .
so there are a lot of opportunities that the green challenge will also bring green technology growth to industries in asia . "
governments lead the way in order to tap this potential , the role of governments is crucial .
many asian governments such as china and south korea have made green growth a policy priority .
south korea 's deputy environment minister yoon jong-soo explained what his administration has been doing to mobilize the citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese continue to rely heavily on highly polluting coal ...
he gave three examples : " one is the green start movement .
it is a nationwide campaign : we have to adopt a green lifestyle .
the second is the carbon point system : when households reduce carbon emissions and save energy , they get rewards in the form of cash or coupons .
the third is a ' carbon labeling ' system .
it provides information how much carbon dioxide has been emitted in the course of production , transportation and disposal of goods .
incentives are very important , rather than regulations . "
oil subsidies prevent innovation but stuart dean , who heads general electric in the asean region , cautioned that other policies in asia hinder growth in the green sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but they also have become leading producers in solar technology " i think one of the areas that really need to be addressed early on is the area of subsidies for fossil fuels .
at least half of the countries in asia still have subsidies for fossil fuel , which then affect the pricing of electricity .
we recognize that there are socio-economic groups that benefit from those subsidies ; but i think it is also clear there are better ways to do income redistribution than subsidizing everyone 's use of fossil fuels . "
dean said europe became a leader in alternative energies only because high taxes made oil products expensive .
both industry and government representatives agreed that there is enormous potential for public-private partnerships in the realm of green growth .
with the right leadership , asia 's booming economies might soon become known as the " green tigers " .

visitors are invited to walk all over them - and rethink energy use and climate change . it 's not your typical museum .
those who want to experience the ruhr atoll art project up close have to take a paddle boat to get there .
and touching the work wo n't draw nasty looks from some museum employees - quiet the opposite actually , it 's strongly encouraged . the 300-square-meter -lrb- about 3,200-square-foot -rrb- installation is particularly child-friendly , said the mastermind behind the project , artist norbert bauer .
his aim is to make art accessible . " i think art can and should always be fun , " he said .
" i 'm not going to take it all so deadly seriously . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer 's vision for the ruhr atoll was a product of runner 's endorphines , he said located in the middle of the six-kilometer-long -lrb- 3.7-mile -rrb- lake baldeney reservoir , bauer 's work includes an iceberg , an abandoned submarine , a teahouse and a rusty waterworks .
it was created because nearby essen and the surrounding ruhr region - historically , germany 's heart of heavy industry - were selected as europe 's 2010 capital of culture . " i ca n't say if it has great public significance , " said passer-by johannes limbeck of the atoll , " but it 's interesting to stand up here and look down at lake baldeney and see something other than little boats . " limbeck is one of three million visitors who make their way to essen 's reservoir each year to enjoy the water and the sunshine .

as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 14.06.2010 german states plan to talk money for opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dark clould of uncertainty still hovers over opel four german states with opel plants will meet on tuesday to discuss loan guarantees for the us-owned , financially-troubled german carmaker .
whether they say " ja " after a federal government " nein " is unclear . after more than a year of tough negotiations over opel 's future , industry and financial experts agree the carmaker does n't need to hear another " jein " , a german expression for " yes and no " , on the topic of public aid .
that was more or less the response of chancellor angela merkel last week when she rejected opel 's request for loan guarantees at the federal level but said the company was free to seek aid from state governments and other groups , including the european investment bank .
explore options the states hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have agreed to explore options at a tuesday meeting after the federal government rejected the auto manufacturer 's request for aid .
opel had applied for 1.1 billion euros in federal guarantees from a pool of government bailout money , dubbed the " deutschlandfond " , to back private-sector loans .
us-based auto giant general motors , which owns opel , says it needs more than 3 billion euros to restructure its european operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel is up and down on helping opel when announcing the government 's decision last week , chancellor merkel said the four states were " able " to give loan guarantees .
and all four have signaled a willingness to help financially .
to what extent will be the focus of tuesday 's meeting .
the four states are eager to help opel for a number of reasons , but the biggest is jobs .
plants in their states employ more than 23,000 people - half of opel 's total workforce in europe .
and thousands of more jobs are linked to providing car parts and other goods and services to the plants .
there is state money .
hesse , for instance , has a 1.5 billion euro guarantee program for 2010 .
last year the state lent opel 347 million euros as part of an emergency bridge loan .
the loan has since been repaid with interest .
" complete catastrophe " but speculation is rife that the states have yet to agree to a coordinated approach and could walk away from the talks without a plan .
" the situation with opel is a complete catastrophe , " said christoph stuermer , an industry analyst with ihs global insight in frankfurt .
" the entire process has been terribly mismanaged by politicians . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel employees , more than 23,000 in europe , want to keep their jobs helmut becker , director of the institute for economic analysis and communication in munich , is highly critical of german taxpayers being forced to cover any expenses for the us carmaker .
" why should anybody subsidize carmakers now that their business has bounced back , with sales up 30 , 40 , even 50 percent depending on the market ? "
becker asked .
" why give them money in the middle of a boom ? "
financial responsibility not only that , becker argues that if gm is so determined to keep opel , then the parent must accept financial responsibility for its subsidiary .
last year , germany was ready to back a bid for opel led by canada 's magna international , but the us carmaker reversed its plan to sell the german company .
gm is in a difficult position to negotiate deals .
the company would have collapsed if the us government had not sweetened a structured insolvency with around $ 50 billion -lrb- 41 million euros -rrb- in public funds .
the government holds a majority stake in the company .
and as long as the carmaker , dubbed " government motors " by critics of state aid , remains state-owned , it can expect to face political winds when trying to tap funds .

russia , along with the european union , has agreed to send humanitarian aid . tens of thousands of uzbeks have fled the area for neighbouring uzbekistan , with several thousand more waiting to get in . no troops for now even if russia opts to not get involved in the conflict , peace troops could be sent by the collective security treaty organization , a regional defense block led by russia .

russia , along with the european union , has agreed to send humanitarian aid . tens of thousands of uzbeks have fled the area for neighbouring uzbekistan , with several thousand more waiting to get in . no troops for now even if russia opts to not get involved in the conflict , peace troops could be sent by the collective security treaty organization , a regional defense block led by russia .

kyrgyzstan has not yet done enough to calm the situation by itself , said chairman nikolai patrushev .
but , he said , other measures to help kyrgyzstan solve the crisis are underway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 opening blow-out earns loew redemption for a day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukas podolski paid back coach loew 's faith in him the biggest winner in germany 's emphatic 4-0 win over australia was embattled coach joachim loew .
but he and others are warning against exaggerating the significance of that victory . everybody loves a winner .
germany 's one-sided demolition of australia on sunday prompted frenetic celebrations in public viewing areas and parades of flag-flying , honking cars in the nation 's cities .
monday morning newspapers and television programs were hardly less euphoric in hailing the victory .
" this will be our world cup , " proclaimed germany 's leading tabloid bild .
" loew was proven right in all respects . "
former german national goalkeeper toni schumacher seconded those sentiments .
" despite all the criticism , loew did everything right , " the goalkeeping legend told the public television station zdf .
ironically , though , many of those now singing loew 's praises are the same ones who criticized the national team coach for sticking with out-of-form veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski just a few days previously .
and cooler heads are cautioning fans not to read too much into one convincing result .
one of them is loew himself .
no euphoria , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were smiles all around after the big win right after the match , the 50-year-old coach was doing his best to dampen expectations .
when asked if he thought he had done everything right , loew said no .
" we 've still got things to improve , " loew told reporters .
" we all know australia is n't the absolute measure of things , and of course we 'll face tougher tests in the tournament ... there 's no reason for euphoria . "
the coach did , however , take the opportunity to reiterate the logic behind starting podolski and klose , who both scored against australia .
" miroslav klose has been with us since 2002 and has scored 11 world cup goals , " loew said .
" -lsb- podolski -rsb- played his first tournament in 2004 and has always been one of our best players .
i know i can trust these players , even if they do have patchy stretches . "
indeed , after a wretched club season with cologne , podolski looked convincing .
he was an active and integrated part of germany 's midfield , and the shot that opened the scoring against australia was measured at 126 kilometers -lrb- 78 miles -rrb- per hour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose broke a long scoring drought with his header klose 's performance was more ambiguous .
the goal he headed in the first half showcased one of the striker 's strengths .
but the three sitters he missed were also indications of why he spent much of this past season on bayern munich 's bench .
on the other hand , youngsters thomas mueller and mesut oezil doubtlessly deserve the praise they are receiving , as germany 's offense clicked on all cylinders against the overmatched australians .
still open questions more football-savvy commentators agreed that the socceroos , a team loew had talked up before the game , were not the sort of opponents to truly test the squad .
" neither did the supposedly fearsome australians break any legs , nor did they pose much of an offensive threat after the fourth minute , " sports reporter christina goedecke wrote in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" after podolski made it 1-0 , their defensive strategy flew out the window . "
ahead of the world cup , many people worried whether sami khedira could replace the injured michael ballack in midfield and whether the central defense of per mertesacker and arne friedrich would hold up under pressure .
bildunterschrift : sami khedira was n't unduly troubled by australia 's luke wilkshire all three of those players looked good on sunday .
but then again , it would have been difficult not to look good against australia , who played without a true striker and then went down a in the first half .
the same goes for germany 's new no. 1 goalkeeper , 24-year-old manuel neuer , who was hardly tested in the match .
germany 's next game is against serbia on friday , and loew is already building them up as tougher foes .
but given their lackluster loss to ghana on sunday , the serbians may not pose a top-level test either .
indeed , germany may have to wait until the knock-out stages to find out how they measure up against the real competition for the title .
that 's the kind of problem , though , that all teams like to have .
so in the meantime , the press and fans can keep up the enthusiasm generated by the most impressive start of any team thus far in the world cup .
and loew 's new reputation as a footballing genius will survive at least for the next couple of days .

as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .

" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .

" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .

an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .

with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .
daisuke matsui crossed from the right wing to the opposite side of the goal and found keisuke honda all alone .
honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .
a misguided header resulted in an own-goal , giving the netherlands the only goal they needed on their way to a 2-0 win .
bildunterschrift : simon poulsen 's header -lrb- right -rrb- deflected off daniel agger -lrb- center -rrb- and rolled into the danish goal just after both teams returned to the pitch following a scoreless first half , the netherlands had possession and were moving the ball down the pitch .
dutch striker robin van persie took a pass near the end line and crossed the ball in front of the goal .
danish defender daniel agger leapt for the ball to try and clear it , but it sailed over his head , leaving poulsen to head it out of the area .
but instead of clearing the ball , poulsen 's header glanced off agger 's back and rolled into the corner of his own goal .
danish keeper thomas sorensen was standing on the other side of the net and could only watch the ball trickle over the line .
the second goal for the netherlands involved a bit of luck as well .
dutch striker eljero elia took a shot from close range , which sorensen managed to get a hand on and deflect into the post .
the ball bounced back into play , where elia 's teammate dirk kuyt cleanly sent the rebound to the back of the net for the game 's final goal .
the netherlands and japan are tied on points at the top of group e , with the dutch having the better goal differential .

germany 's one-sided demolition of australia on sunday prompted frenetic celebrations in public viewing areas and parades of flag-flying , honking cars in the nation 's cities .
monday morning newspapers and television programs were hardly less euphoric in hailing the victory .
" this will be our world cup , " proclaimed germany 's leading tabloid bild .

" despite all the criticism , loew did everything right , " the goalkeeping legend told the public television station zdf .
ironically , though , many of those now singing loew 's praises are the same ones who criticized the national team coach for sticking with out-of-form veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski just a few days previously .
and cooler heads are cautioning fans not to read too much into one convincing result .
one of them is loew himself .
no euphoria , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were smiles all around after the big win right after the match , the 50-year-old coach was doing his best to dampen expectations .
when asked if he thought he had done everything right , loew said no .
" we 've still got things to improve , " loew told reporters .
" we all know australia is n't the absolute measure of things , and of course we 'll face tougher tests in the tournament ... there 's no reason for euphoria . "
the coach did , however , take the opportunity to reiterate the logic behind starting podolski and klose , who both scored against australia .
" miroslav klose has been with us since 2002 and has scored 11 world cup goals , " loew said .
" -lsb- podolski -rsb- played his first tournament in 2004 and has always been one of our best players .
i know i can trust these players , even if they do have patchy stretches . "
indeed , after a wretched club season with cologne , podolski looked convincing .
he was an active and integrated part of germany 's midfield , and the shot that opened the scoring against australia was measured at 126 kilometers -lrb- 78 miles -rrb- per hour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose broke a long scoring drought with his header klose 's performance was more ambiguous .

on the other hand , youngsters thomas mueller and mesut oezil doubtlessly deserve the praise they are receiving , as germany 's offense clicked on all cylinders against the overmatched australians .
still open questions more football-savvy commentators agreed that the socceroos , a team loew had talked up before the game , were not the sort of opponents to truly test the squad .
" neither did the supposedly fearsome australians break any legs , nor did they pose much of an offensive threat after the fourth minute , " sports reporter christina goedecke wrote in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" after podolski made it 1-0 , their defensive strategy flew out the window . "
ahead of the world cup , many people worried whether sami khedira could replace the injured michael ballack in midfield and whether the central defense of per mertesacker and arne friedrich would hold up under pressure .
bildunterschrift : sami khedira was n't unduly troubled by australia 's luke wilkshire all three of those players looked good on sunday .
but then again , it would have been difficult not to look good against australia , who played without a true striker and then went down a in the first half .
the same goes for germany 's new no. 1 goalkeeper , 24-year-old manuel neuer , who was hardly tested in the match .
germany 's next game is against serbia on friday , and loew is already building them up as tougher foes .
but given their lackluster loss to ghana on sunday , the serbians may not pose a top-level test either .
indeed , germany may have to wait until the knock-out stages to find out how they measure up against the real competition for the title .
that 's the kind of problem , though , that all teams like to have .
so in the meantime , the press and fans can keep up the enthusiasm generated by the most impressive start of any team thus far in the world cup .

" neither did the supposedly fearsome australians break any legs , nor did they pose much of an offensive threat after the fourth minute , " sports reporter christina goedecke wrote in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" after podolski made it 1-0 , their defensive strategy flew out the window . "
ahead of the world cup , many people worried whether sami khedira could replace the injured michael ballack in midfield and whether the central defense of per mertesacker and arne friedrich would hold up under pressure .
bildunterschrift : sami khedira was n't unduly troubled by australia 's luke wilkshire all three of those players looked good on sunday .
but then again , it would have been difficult not to look good against australia , who played without a true striker and then went down a in the first half .
the same goes for germany 's new no. 1 goalkeeper , 24-year-old manuel neuer , who was hardly tested in the match .
germany 's next game is against serbia on friday , and loew is already building them up as tougher foes .
but given their lackluster loss to ghana on sunday , the serbians may not pose a top-level test either .
indeed , germany may have to wait until the knock-out stages to find out how they measure up against the real competition for the title .
that 's the kind of problem , though , that all teams like to have .
so in the meantime , the press and fans can keep up the enthusiasm generated by the most impressive start of any team thus far in the world cup .
and loew 's new reputation as a footballing genius will survive at least for the next couple of days .

however , some still preach caution . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
australia did n't have their best day .
at the same time a yellow card was against germany because of lack of effort .
it 's the small things that can stop a team in the next round .
each player has a job to do .
you must stay humble and ready for the next game . - malcolm , canada good article by nick amies .
it seems churlish to talk down the excellent display of the german national team against australia , but one must look at the early formline like any good horseracing enthusiast would .
this was a very poor australian team , reduced to ten men in the second half .
if germany can take out serbia without problems then i will probably become a believer , as i feel confident that they can beat ghana -lrb- weakened by the absence of michael essien -rrb- comfortably .
the german media -lrb- especially the three incredible tabloids -rrb- are whipping the good citizens up into a frenzy , but , i repeat , this early formline is flawed , without a doubt .
let 's therefore hang-on a bit and wait for serbia ? - fred , germany congratulations on winning the match versus australia with this first ideal performance and score of my beloved deutschland national team in this world cup .
podolski , who played a key role in this match , i had every confidence and very sure that you would head up your group and you would be number one player .
i hope that the next matches turn out to be as or more successful than this for you .
keep up the good performance !
podolski is the man of match and the icon of german football . - belkebir , algeria greetings from our rainbow listener 's club in kushtia here in bangladesh .
congratulations to the german football team for their win in their first match against australia in the worldcup 2010 .
we wish them every success . - wobaydullah , bangladesh to an oil-stained world two events brought grace elegance and happiness : winter games in canada and this week the “ happy ” world cup in south africa .
today australia will add more of the joy of sport to a sad world , whatever the result .
south africa led that charge in its opener and usa followed it last night . - neil , australia a poor mexican referee and no harry kewell .
the mexican referee deliberately missed a handball by a german player in the box early in the second half and should have awarded a penalty to australia .
the less said about the tim cahill incident by me the better .
this could be the death of australian football at the 2010 fifa world cup in south africa .
the socceroos are in a suicide mood .
my tip to win is spain because their country needs a morale boosting event for their poor economy and high unemployment in europe . - stuart , australia bildunterschrift : lukas podolski scored the opening goal in the early minutes of the match greetings from rajshahi , bangladesh .
i hope you are well .

zumwinkel welcomed the closing of the probe , which he said came to the conclusion that " any penal accusation against me is unfounded . "
" i regard this as a pleasant clarification , as a first-class termination of proceedings , " zumwinkel , who has denied any involvement in the spying , declared in bonn .
" it could not be better . "
the investigation was launched two years ago after deutsche telekom acknowledged that there were cases of misuse of call records in 2005 and 2006 .
germany 's journalists ' association djv criticized the outcome of the probe . " it is hard to imagine that the former telekom chiefs allegedly knew nothing about criminal interference into the freedom of the press , " djv chairman michael konken said .
eavesdropping scandal deutsche telekom ag was found to have monitored telephone records by senior executives and journalists to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws - and released a storm of public outrage .
the bonn prosecutors said on monday they were bringing charges against three telekom employees , including a leading security official .
the company has stressed that there is no suggestion that calls were tapped , but rather that call records detailing the time , participants and duration of calls were improperly monitored .

in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .
daisuke matsui crossed from the right wing to the opposite side of the goal and found keisuke honda all alone .
honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .
a misguided header resulted in an own-goal , giving the netherlands the only goal they needed on their way to a 2-0 win .
bildunterschrift : simon poulsen 's header -lrb- right -rrb- deflected off daniel agger -lrb- center -rrb- and rolled into the danish goal just after both teams returned to the pitch following a scoreless first half , the netherlands had possession and were moving the ball down the pitch .
dutch striker robin van persie took a pass near the end line and crossed the ball in front of the goal .
danish defender daniel agger leapt for the ball to try and clear it , but it sailed over his head , leaving poulsen to head it out of the area .
but instead of clearing the ball , poulsen 's header glanced off agger 's back and rolled into the corner of his own goal .
danish keeper thomas sorensen was standing on the other side of the net and could only watch the ball trickle over the line .
the second goal for the netherlands involved a bit of luck as well .
dutch striker eljero elia took a shot from close range , which sorensen managed to get a hand on and deflect into the post .
the ball bounced back into play , where elia 's teammate dirk kuyt cleanly sent the rebound to the back of the net for the game 's final goal .
the netherlands and japan are tied on points at the top of group e , with the dutch having the better goal differential .

frans muller , a board member of germany 's metro group , admitted that these are serious problems , but he also pointed out that growing economies have an edge when it comes to being innovative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus schwab speaks at the world economic forum on east asia " i think asia has not only a challenge , but also in this respect an enormous chance , " muller said .
" what you see is that more and more international companies establish their r & d centers in asia , particularly china , korea and japan ; and that a lot of technologies that are now a strength of asia , are linked to green technologies .
interfaces are possible : there are a lot of opportunities between the it sector in asia , which is very strong , and green technologies .
so there are a lot of opportunities that the green challenge will also bring green technology growth to industries in asia . "
governments lead the way in order to tap this potential , the role of governments is crucial .
many asian governments such as china and south korea have made green growth a policy priority .
south korea 's deputy environment minister yoon jong-soo explained what his administration has been doing to mobilize the citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese continue to rely heavily on highly polluting coal ...
he gave three examples : " one is the green start movement .
it is a nationwide campaign : we have to adopt a green lifestyle .
the second is the carbon point system : when households reduce carbon emissions and save energy , they get rewards in the form of cash or coupons .
the third is a ' carbon labeling ' system .
it provides information how much carbon dioxide has been emitted in the course of production , transportation and disposal of goods .
incentives are very important , rather than regulations . "
oil subsidies prevent innovation but stuart dean , who heads general electric in the asean region , cautioned that other policies in asia hinder growth in the green sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but they also have become leading producers in solar technology " i think one of the areas that really need to be addressed early on is the area of subsidies for fossil fuels .
at least half of the countries in asia still have subsidies for fossil fuel , which then affect the pricing of electricity .
we recognize that there are socio-economic groups that benefit from those subsidies ; but i think it is also clear there are better ways to do income redistribution than subsidizing everyone 's use of fossil fuels . "
dean said europe became a leader in alternative energies only because high taxes made oil products expensive .
both industry and government representatives agreed that there is enormous potential for public-private partnerships in the realm of green growth .
with the right leadership , asia 's booming economies might soon become known as the " green tigers " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 defending world cup champs italy draw in 2010 opener großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de rossi knocked in an excellent corner from pepe in 2006 , italy won the world cup in a penalty shootout against france .
in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .
daisuke matsui crossed from the right wing to the opposite side of the goal and found keisuke honda all alone .
honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .
a misguided header resulted in an own-goal , giving the netherlands the only goal they needed on their way to a 2-0 win .
bildunterschrift : simon poulsen 's header -lrb- right -rrb- deflected off daniel agger -lrb- center -rrb- and rolled into the danish goal just after both teams returned to the pitch following a scoreless first half , the netherlands had possession and were moving the ball down the pitch .
dutch striker robin van persie took a pass near the end line and crossed the ball in front of the goal .
danish defender daniel agger leapt for the ball to try and clear it , but it sailed over his head , leaving poulsen to head it out of the area .
but instead of clearing the ball , poulsen 's header glanced off agger 's back and rolled into the corner of his own goal .
danish keeper thomas sorensen was standing on the other side of the net and could only watch the ball trickle over the line .
the second goal for the netherlands involved a bit of luck as well .
dutch striker eljero elia took a shot from close range , which sorensen managed to get a hand on and deflect into the post .
the ball bounced back into play , where elia 's teammate dirk kuyt cleanly sent the rebound to the back of the net for the game 's final goal .
the netherlands and japan are tied on points at the top of group e , with the dutch having the better goal differential .

in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .
daisuke matsui crossed from the right wing to the opposite side of the goal and found keisuke honda all alone .
honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .
a misguided header resulted in an own-goal , giving the netherlands the only goal they needed on their way to a 2-0 win .

dutch striker robin van persie took a pass near the end line and crossed the ball in front of the goal .
danish defender daniel agger leapt for the ball to try and clear it , but it sailed over his head , leaving poulsen to head it out of the area .
but instead of clearing the ball , poulsen 's header glanced off agger 's back and rolled into the corner of his own goal .
danish keeper thomas sorensen was standing on the other side of the net and could only watch the ball trickle over the line .
the second goal for the netherlands involved a bit of luck as well .
dutch striker eljero elia took a shot from close range , which sorensen managed to get a hand on and deflect into the post .
the ball bounced back into play , where elia 's teammate dirk kuyt cleanly sent the rebound to the back of the net for the game 's final goal .
the netherlands and japan are tied on points at the top of group e , with the dutch having the better goal differential .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry back to first page back 2/2 moscow fears ethnic instability on russia 's borders russia has its own interests of course .
as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de belgium -pipe- 14.06.2010 belgian separatist party wins election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de wever wants in the end to split belgium parliamentary election results in belgium are expected to do little to ease decades of tensions between the wealthy flanders in the north of the country , and the poorer french-speaking walloons in the south . belgium has begun the search for a coalition government after right-wing flemish separatists won sunday 's parliamentary election .
final official results released by the national electoral commission on monday show that the new flemish alliance -lrb- nva -rrb- secured 27 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament , up from just eight seats in 2007 .
the nva , led by 39-year-old bart de wever , ultimately wants to split the wealthy dutch-speaking flanders in the north from belgium 's poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia in the south .
de wever passionately advocates the end of belgium , calling its six million dutch-speakers and 4.5 million francophones a " hopeless mismatch . "
linguistic disputes have long hounded belgium and dominated the election campaign .
but a split-up of belgium after this election is unlikely .
french-speaking rivals come close second the french-speaking socialists -lrb- ps -rrb- with 26 seats are now the country 's second largest party .
the christian democrats , of outgoing prime minister yves leterme secured just 17 seats .
together , the nva and the ps would have just over one third of all the seats in parliament .
if the two parties , despite massive ideological differences , formed a coalition , then 58-year old ps leader elio di rupo could end up becoming belgium 's first french-speaking prime minister since 1974 , as de wever has said he does not want the job .
" you do n't have to like each other to work together , " said di rupo .
“ we french-speaking belgians must take a step towards our dutch-speaking counterparts , and vice versa , if we are to negotiate issues that we can not avoid for our country . ”
due to linguistic , political and economic differences , belgium has had four governments and three prime ministers since 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elio di rupo will have to make hard decisions about whether to join the government another long wait would worry financial markets long talks could worry financial markets .
analysts are concerned months of coalition talks could delay cuts to state spending .
" if in september we see that a government is n't being formed , if we see the crisis is prolonged , then we could see a market reaction at that time , " said jacques de pover , an economist at dexia .
" the party that got the most votes is a separatist party and it throws into question over a long timeframe , over a few years and longer ... who 's going to pay that debt back , " said peter chatwell , a strategist at credit agricole .
nothing changes , for now leterme 's administration will remain in charge until a new government is formed .
king albert ii met with leterme on monday and formally accepted his government 's resignation .
the king also received the heads of both houses of parliament and begun holding talks with party leaders including de wever .
leterme is still expected to be in office when belgium takes on the six-month rotating presidency of the 27-member eu on july 1 .
the european commission has expressed confidence that belgium 's own political troubles will not affect its ability to handle eu policy matters during the six months .

final official results released by the national electoral commission on monday show that the new flemish alliance -lrb- nva -rrb- secured 27 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament , up from just eight seats in 2007 .
the nva , led by 39-year-old bart de wever , ultimately wants to split the wealthy dutch-speaking flanders in the north from belgium 's poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia in the south .
de wever passionately advocates the end of belgium , calling its six million dutch-speakers and 4.5 million francophones a " hopeless mismatch . "
linguistic disputes have long hounded belgium and dominated the election campaign .
but a split-up of belgium after this election is unlikely .
french-speaking rivals come close second the french-speaking socialists -lrb- ps -rrb- with 26 seats are now the country 's second largest party .
the christian democrats , of outgoing prime minister yves leterme secured just 17 seats .
together , the nva and the ps would have just over one third of all the seats in parliament .
if the two parties , despite massive ideological differences , formed a coalition , then 58-year old ps leader elio di rupo could end up becoming belgium 's first french-speaking prime minister since 1974 , as de wever has said he does not want the job .
" you do n't have to like each other to work together , " said di rupo .
“ we french-speaking belgians must take a step towards our dutch-speaking counterparts , and vice versa , if we are to negotiate issues that we can not avoid for our country . ”
due to linguistic , political and economic differences , belgium has had four governments and three prime ministers since 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elio di rupo will have to make hard decisions about whether to join the government another long wait would worry financial markets long talks could worry financial markets .
analysts are concerned months of coalition talks could delay cuts to state spending .
" if in september we see that a government is n't being formed , if we see the crisis is prolonged , then we could see a market reaction at that time , " said jacques de pover , an economist at dexia .
" the party that got the most votes is a separatist party and it throws into question over a long timeframe , over a few years and longer ... who 's going to pay that debt back , " said peter chatwell , a strategist at credit agricole .
nothing changes , for now leterme 's administration will remain in charge until a new government is formed .
king albert ii met with leterme on monday and formally accepted his government 's resignation .
the king also received the heads of both houses of parliament and begun holding talks with party leaders including de wever .
leterme is still expected to be in office when belgium takes on the six-month rotating presidency of the 27-member eu on july 1 .
the european commission has expressed confidence that belgium 's own political troubles will not affect its ability to handle eu policy matters during the six months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

if germany can take out serbia without problems then i will probably become a believer , as i feel confident that they can beat ghana -lrb- weakened by the absence of michael essien -rrb- comfortably .
the german media -lrb- especially the three incredible tabloids -rrb- are whipping the good citizens up into a frenzy , but , i repeat , this early formline is flawed , without a doubt .
let 's therefore hang-on a bit and wait for serbia ? - fred , germany congratulations on winning the match versus australia with this first ideal performance and score of my beloved deutschland national team in this world cup .

keep up the good performance !

today australia will add more of the joy of sport to a sad world , whatever the result .
south africa led that charge in its opener and usa followed it last night . - neil , australia a poor mexican referee and no harry kewell .
the mexican referee deliberately missed a handball by a german player in the box early in the second half and should have awarded a penalty to australia .
the less said about the tim cahill incident by me the better .
this could be the death of australian football at the 2010 fifa world cup in south africa .
the socceroos are in a suicide mood .
my tip to win is spain because their country needs a morale boosting event for their poor economy and high unemployment in europe . - stuart , australia bildunterschrift : lukas podolski scored the opening goal in the early minutes of the match greetings from rajshahi , bangladesh .
i hope you are well .
i am very glad that my dream team germany made a good start in fifa world cup 2010 .
i enjoyed the match with my family members .
i hope they will be the champion . - salahuddin , bangladesh hats off to the german football team for winning their first game in the world cup .
i desire to see your team as the winner . - sayan , india australia was easy to beat .
now , lets see what 's next . - azura via facebook ghana and serbia will be the next victims ! - eugene via facebook australia will come back . - antoinette via facebook the dominance was obvious but it was started by two poles !
great job podolski and klose ! - christopher via facebook germany are a very good side .
no doubt aussiland will take this loss and should play better in the next round . - jason via facebook germany will meet other very good teams before winning the cup ! - ivy via facebook i agree that it was an amazing warm-up exercise for deutschland .

however , some still preach caution . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
australia did n't have their best day .
at the same time a yellow card was against germany because of lack of effort .
it 's the small things that can stop a team in the next round .
each player has a job to do .
you must stay humble and ready for the next game . - malcolm , canada good article by nick amies .
it seems churlish to talk down the excellent display of the german national team against australia , but one must look at the early formline like any good horseracing enthusiast would .
this was a very poor australian team , reduced to ten men in the second half .
if germany can take out serbia without problems then i will probably become a believer , as i feel confident that they can beat ghana -lrb- weakened by the absence of michael essien -rrb- comfortably .
the german media -lrb- especially the three incredible tabloids -rrb- are whipping the good citizens up into a frenzy , but , i repeat , this early formline is flawed , without a doubt .
let 's therefore hang-on a bit and wait for serbia ? - fred , germany congratulations on winning the match versus australia with this first ideal performance and score of my beloved deutschland national team in this world cup .
podolski , who played a key role in this match , i had every confidence and very sure that you would head up your group and you would be number one player .
i hope that the next matches turn out to be as or more successful than this for you .
keep up the good performance !
podolski is the man of match and the icon of german football . - belkebir , algeria greetings from our rainbow listener 's club in kushtia here in bangladesh .
congratulations to the german football team for their win in their first match against australia in the worldcup 2010 .
we wish them every success . - wobaydullah , bangladesh to an oil-stained world two events brought grace elegance and happiness : winter games in canada and this week the “ happy ” world cup in south africa .
today australia will add more of the joy of sport to a sad world , whatever the result .
south africa led that charge in its opener and usa followed it last night . - neil , australia a poor mexican referee and no harry kewell .
the mexican referee deliberately missed a handball by a german player in the box early in the second half and should have awarded a penalty to australia .
the less said about the tim cahill incident by me the better .
this could be the death of australian football at the 2010 fifa world cup in south africa .
the socceroos are in a suicide mood .
my tip to win is spain because their country needs a morale boosting event for their poor economy and high unemployment in europe . - stuart , australia bildunterschrift : lukas podolski scored the opening goal in the early minutes of the match greetings from rajshahi , bangladesh .
i hope you are well .
i am very glad that my dream team germany made a good start in fifa world cup 2010 .

i hope they will be the champion . - salahuddin , bangladesh hats off to the german football team for winning their first game in the world cup .

but he and others are warning against exaggerating the significance of that victory . everybody loves a winner .
germany 's one-sided demolition of australia on sunday prompted frenetic celebrations in public viewing areas and parades of flag-flying , honking cars in the nation 's cities .
monday morning newspapers and television programs were hardly less euphoric in hailing the victory .
" this will be our world cup , " proclaimed germany 's leading tabloid bild .
" loew was proven right in all respects . "
former german national goalkeeper toni schumacher seconded those sentiments .
" despite all the criticism , loew did everything right , " the goalkeeping legend told the public television station zdf .
ironically , though , many of those now singing loew 's praises are the same ones who criticized the national team coach for sticking with out-of-form veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski just a few days previously .
and cooler heads are cautioning fans not to read too much into one convincing result .
one of them is loew himself .
no euphoria , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were smiles all around after the big win right after the match , the 50-year-old coach was doing his best to dampen expectations .
when asked if he thought he had done everything right , loew said no .
" we 've still got things to improve , " loew told reporters .
" we all know australia is n't the absolute measure of things , and of course we 'll face tougher tests in the tournament ... there 's no reason for euphoria . "
the coach did , however , take the opportunity to reiterate the logic behind starting podolski and klose , who both scored against australia .
" miroslav klose has been with us since 2002 and has scored 11 world cup goals , " loew said .
" -lsb- podolski -rsb- played his first tournament in 2004 and has always been one of our best players .
i know i can trust these players , even if they do have patchy stretches . "
indeed , after a wretched club season with cologne , podolski looked convincing .
he was an active and integrated part of germany 's midfield , and the shot that opened the scoring against australia was measured at 126 kilometers -lrb- 78 miles -rrb- per hour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose broke a long scoring drought with his header klose 's performance was more ambiguous .
the goal he headed in the first half showcased one of the striker 's strengths .
but the three sitters he missed were also indications of why he spent much of this past season on bayern munich 's bench .
on the other hand , youngsters thomas mueller and mesut oezil doubtlessly deserve the praise they are receiving , as germany 's offense clicked on all cylinders against the overmatched australians .
still open questions more football-savvy commentators agreed that the socceroos , a team loew had talked up before the game , were not the sort of opponents to truly test the squad .
" neither did the supposedly fearsome australians break any legs , nor did they pose much of an offensive threat after the fourth minute , " sports reporter christina goedecke wrote in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" after podolski made it 1-0 , their defensive strategy flew out the window . "
ahead of the world cup , many people worried whether sami khedira could replace the injured michael ballack in midfield and whether the central defense of per mertesacker and arne friedrich would hold up under pressure .
bildunterschrift : sami khedira was n't unduly troubled by australia 's luke wilkshire all three of those players looked good on sunday .
but then again , it would have been difficult not to look good against australia , who played without a true striker and then went down a in the first half .
the same goes for germany 's new no. 1 goalkeeper , 24-year-old manuel neuer , who was hardly tested in the match .
germany 's next game is against serbia on friday , and loew is already building them up as tougher foes .
but given their lackluster loss to ghana on sunday , the serbians may not pose a top-level test either .
indeed , germany may have to wait until the knock-out stages to find out how they measure up against the real competition for the title .
that 's the kind of problem , though , that all teams like to have .
so in the meantime , the press and fans can keep up the enthusiasm generated by the most impressive start of any team thus far in the world cup .
and loew 's new reputation as a footballing genius will survive at least for the next couple of days .

germany 's one-sided demolition of australia on sunday prompted frenetic celebrations in public viewing areas and parades of flag-flying , honking cars in the nation 's cities .
monday morning newspapers and television programs were hardly less euphoric in hailing the victory .

" despite all the criticism , loew did everything right , " the goalkeeping legend told the public television station zdf .
ironically , though , many of those now singing loew 's praises are the same ones who criticized the national team coach for sticking with out-of-form veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski just a few days previously .

" -lsb- podolski -rsb- played his first tournament in 2004 and has always been one of our best players .

indeed , after a wretched club season with cologne , podolski looked convincing .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 the continent has its world cup , but can an african nation actually win it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's asamoah gyan scored the goal that gave africa its first win in the tournament the world cup had to wait for 82 years before it could come to an african nation .
now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 14.06.2010 indian gays long for greater social acceptance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lesbian , gay , bi-sexual and transgender community has been fighting for legal rights almost a year ago , the gay and lesbian community in india celebrated a landmark ruling .
new delhi 's high court decriminalized homosexuality by striking down parts of the country 's colonial-era penal code .
but the fight has not stopped there .
the community is struggling for greater social acceptance and full legal rights . after last year 's historic verdict that ended state-sanctioned homophobia , india 's fledgling gay community is working to ensure that the delhi high court 's decisive verdict is not overturned in the supreme court .
but simultaneously , the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender or lgbt community as it is widely known , has begun fighting for legal rights .
gautam bhan , a prominent gay activist , outlines the roadmap ahead : " we have long said as part of the gay rights movement that the victory in the delhi high court last july , was not the victory that ended a battle .
it was a victory that began one .
i mean really the fight has started now .
decriminalization was the first step .
there is still no positive legal inclusion for gays and lesbians in the indian legal framework .
for example there is no non-discrimination in employment , or in health benefits or taxation or in joint home loans or in the right to visit your partner when they are sick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay rights supporters celebrate in delhi following the landmark ruling on july 2 , 2009 gay rights and law indian law does not recognize same-sex marriages , nor does it provide for civil unions .
in fact the government is planning to bring in legislation under which gay and lesbian couples can not have children born with the help of an indian surrogate mother .
it is these exclusions that the lgbt community is striving to abolish . " there is a range of exclusions that are built into the system at this point , " says bhan .
" marriage , adoption and family law is well known among this range of exclusions .
but i think particularly critical to us are exclusions based on livelihood , work and employment .
it is still very difficult for transgender to get identification .
hiring practices : people getting fired and being unable to come out at work .
people still fear for their physical safety from the police , even though that has begun to change , so i think in a range of these - from personal , to the private and to intimate , there are still many structural constraints facing the gay-lesbian community in india . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists and people belonging to sexual minorities take part in a gay parade raising awareness ponnu arasu , who is also part of the queer movement , says there is a lot that needs to be done to sensitize people so there is a greater social acceptance . " legal victories are very important and they are a significant step .
but we all know that does not directly mean societal change .
so we still have a long way to go in terms of bringing about a change in the attitudes of people in general , in terms of the smallest units such as our natal families , our parents , to institutions such as schools , hospitals and government institutions such as courts . " many agree that the acceptance of gay marriages , in particular , will require a paradigm shift in the thinking of individuals , religious leaders , law making bodies and governments . as only a handful of countries have legally enshrined gay rights , for the rest of south asia and the developing world the delhi high court ruling is seen as a symbol of hope . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

zumwinkel welcomed the closing of the probe , which he said came to the conclusion that " any penal accusation against me is unfounded . "
" i regard this as a pleasant clarification , as a first-class termination of proceedings , " zumwinkel , who has denied any involvement in the spying , declared in bonn .
" it could not be better . "
the investigation was launched two years ago after deutsche telekom acknowledged that there were cases of misuse of call records in 2005 and 2006 .
germany 's journalists ' association djv criticized the outcome of the probe . " it is hard to imagine that the former telekom chiefs allegedly knew nothing about criminal interference into the freedom of the press , " djv chairman michael konken said .

the bonn prosecutors said on monday they were bringing charges against three telekom employees , including a leading security official .
the company has stressed that there is no suggestion that calls were tapped , but rather that call records detailing the time , participants and duration of calls were improperly monitored .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 the continent has its world cup , but can an african nation actually win it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's asamoah gyan scored the goal that gave africa its first win in the tournament the world cup had to wait for 82 years before it could come to an african nation .
now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .

south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 defending world cup champs italy draw in 2010 opener großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de rossi knocked in an excellent corner from pepe in 2006 , italy won the world cup in a penalty shootout against france .
in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .
daisuke matsui crossed from the right wing to the opposite side of the goal and found keisuke honda all alone .
honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .
a misguided header resulted in an own-goal , giving the netherlands the only goal they needed on their way to a 2-0 win .
bildunterschrift : simon poulsen 's header -lrb- right -rrb- deflected off daniel agger -lrb- center -rrb- and rolled into the danish goal just after both teams returned to the pitch following a scoreless first half , the netherlands had possession and were moving the ball down the pitch .
dutch striker robin van persie took a pass near the end line and crossed the ball in front of the goal .
danish defender daniel agger leapt for the ball to try and clear it , but it sailed over his head , leaving poulsen to head it out of the area .
but instead of clearing the ball , poulsen 's header glanced off agger 's back and rolled into the corner of his own goal .
danish keeper thomas sorensen was standing on the other side of the net and could only watch the ball trickle over the line .
the second goal for the netherlands involved a bit of luck as well .
dutch striker eljero elia took a shot from close range , which sorensen managed to get a hand on and deflect into the post .
the ball bounced back into play , where elia 's teammate dirk kuyt cleanly sent the rebound to the back of the net for the game 's final goal .
the netherlands and japan are tied on points at the top of group e , with the dutch having the better goal differential .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

as well as the obvious future of regional energy security , russian domestic security is heavily linked to the stability of the countries on its borders .
regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .
with states throughout russia 's central asian periphery simmering with ethnic tensions , moscow does n't need a civil war sparking a wider conflict on its doorstep , one which could spread to within its borders and explode in its cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia wants to avoid a spread of unrest around its borders " russia wants a stable international neighbourhood , " torrike-barton said .
" violence , especially with an ethnic or religious dimension , could potentially become contagious throughout the region .
the brutalization of the uzbek community in kyrgyzstan could fuel islamic extremism - and there is no greater nightmare for a russian state still dealing with insurgent forces in the caucasus . "
" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .
china wants to protect economic interests , secrets from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's border with kyrgyzstan presents its own problems china also has much to be concerned about .
beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

regardless of whether there is a kremlin-friendly regime in place or not , kyrgyzstan is of huge importance when it comes to the stability or instability of russia 's neighbours .

" it is not in russia 's interests to have an unstable kyrgyz republic as it will affect their interests in central asia , " asher pirt added .
" the main interest is the fact that moscow is concerned about instability spreading from the region to its own country .
a stable region without ethnic unrest or religious extremism is a strategic goal for russia .
furthermore , moscow cares about the status and the wellbeing of its ethnic russians or compatriots . "
" russia is unlikely to intervene unless it felt that the situation was going to make the region unstable or ethnic russians or compatriots were in danger .
however , the kyrgyz provisional government would very much like the russians to intervene .
at present it is unlikely that this will happen but if the violence escalates , moscow might decide that it has to . "
russia is also concerned about the possibility of being encircled by nato member states should the alliance go ahead with its provocative eastern enlargement .
having kyrgyzstan onside , especially as a partner in the shanghai cooperation organization - the emerging eurasian economic and military cooperation organization - would mean that russia would continue to have a significant obstacle in its plan to block nato expansion .

beijing has clear strategic interests in a stable and friendly kyrgyzstan but also in keeping the united states from dominating the region .
china was the main financial benefactor of president askar akayev , a former us-backed leader who was dropped by washington as soon as he took china 's cash , and its huge economic clout remains beijing 's strongest weapon in retaining a foothold in kyrgyzstan .
while this is seen as crucial for china 's own plan of spreading its influence throughout central asia , it is also an important factor in reducing the chances of the us doing the same .
the chinese see increasing us influence as not only a threat to its plans for eurasia , which along with promoting its emerging market policy also includes energy security and supply , but also a threat to the people 's republic itself .
china 's border with kyrgyzstan runs along the outer reaches of the politically sensitive xinjiang province where ethnic uighurs rioted in july 2009 .
" kyrgyzstan is the number one export market for xinjiang , " said torrike-barton .
" it 's a profitable destination for chinese goods and labourers , so there 's an important economic dimension driving chinese policy toward kyrgyzstan .
but like russia , the key priority is security .
an unstable kyrgyzstan with a restive muslim population does not help chinese efforts to preserve stability in xinjiang and the uighur community . "
while beijing would be concerned by the possibility of an upsurge in ethnic violence stirring up further unrest in xinjiang , it is more concerned that the porous nature of the border is allowing us intelligence agencies to run covert destabilizing operations into the strategically vital and politically fragile province .
beijing believes the flow of people across the border gives us operations a perfect cover .
" china is unlikely to intervene in the crisis , and despite its economic influence and status as a patron for many kyrgyz politicians , has limited capacity to affect the current situation , " torrike-barton added .
" without greater chinese involvement in settling the violence , i doubt we 'll see many repercussions for us-china relations . "
with so much suspicion , distrust and power games at play bteween the world 's most powerful nations , the future of kyrgyzstan may not only shape the region but have an equally important influence on global politics .

both leaders agree they want to protect the euro , but in the past they had disagreed on how to do this . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy presented a united front on several key issues relating to financial and economic reform after a meeting in berlin on monday , despite media reports that the two have had serious disagreements .
merkel appears to have swayed sarkozy on some issues , one of which was the suspension of european union voting rights for countries that seriously violated the bloc 's limits to budget deficits .
sarkozy also backed merkel 's position that all 27 european union member states should be involved in closer economic coordination , rather than just the 16 eurozone countries .
" we need stronger economic governance , " said merkel .
" this must include all of europe 's 27 nations .
this is the only way that we can move europe - with its current weaknesses - forward . "
sarkozy added , however , that there was still a need for eurozone leaders to hold " rapid meetings " when problems arise .
" we saw in the crisis how the markets and speculators , which are not the same thing , were able to react in a thousandth of a second , " sarkozy said .
" our procedures need to become more operational and more pragmatic .
in other words , economic government for the 27 , and if necessary meetings on eurozone problems in the eurozone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two hope to present a unified voice at the coming g-20 meeting differences remain a main point of disagreement between germany and france is the subject of budgetary discipline .
berlin says it wants to reduce its budget deficit through spending cuts alone , and merkel 's government recently unveiled an 80 billion euro -lrb- $ 98 billion -rrb- austerity package - the country 's largest ever .
france argues that doing so would choke off growth and plunge economies back into recession .
but andreas schockenhoff , foreign policy expert for merkel 's christian democrats , spoke to german radio and dismissed media reports that a major rift was developing between berlin and paris , saying they were fueled by domestic politics .
" we know we need stable budgetary policies over the long-term , " he said .
" we also know that if germany and france set clear examples , only then will europe be heard when important issues like international market regulation are discussed at major summits like the g-20 . "
merkel and sarkozy said they are united on the need to tighten regulations on international financial markets , and said they intended to submit a common letter to the group of 20 summit in canada at the end of the month .
both countries have led calls for an international bank tax to make banks contribute for future bailouts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de belgium -pipe- 14.06.2010 belgian separatist party wins election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de wever wants in the end to split belgium parliamentary election results in belgium are expected to do little to ease decades of tensions between the wealthy flanders in the north of the country , and the poorer french-speaking walloons in the south . belgium has begun the search for a coalition government after right-wing flemish separatists won sunday 's parliamentary election .
final official results released by the national electoral commission on monday show that the new flemish alliance -lrb- nva -rrb- secured 27 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament , up from just eight seats in 2007 .
the nva , led by 39-year-old bart de wever , ultimately wants to split the wealthy dutch-speaking flanders in the north from belgium 's poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia in the south .
de wever passionately advocates the end of belgium , calling its six million dutch-speakers and 4.5 million francophones a " hopeless mismatch . "
linguistic disputes have long hounded belgium and dominated the election campaign .
but a split-up of belgium after this election is unlikely .
french-speaking rivals come close second the french-speaking socialists -lrb- ps -rrb- with 26 seats are now the country 's second largest party .
the christian democrats , of outgoing prime minister yves leterme secured just 17 seats .
together , the nva and the ps would have just over one third of all the seats in parliament .
if the two parties , despite massive ideological differences , formed a coalition , then 58-year old ps leader elio di rupo could end up becoming belgium 's first french-speaking prime minister since 1974 , as de wever has said he does not want the job .
" you do n't have to like each other to work together , " said di rupo .
“ we french-speaking belgians must take a step towards our dutch-speaking counterparts , and vice versa , if we are to negotiate issues that we can not avoid for our country . ”
due to linguistic , political and economic differences , belgium has had four governments and three prime ministers since 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elio di rupo will have to make hard decisions about whether to join the government another long wait would worry financial markets long talks could worry financial markets .
analysts are concerned months of coalition talks could delay cuts to state spending .
" if in september we see that a government is n't being formed , if we see the crisis is prolonged , then we could see a market reaction at that time , " said jacques de pover , an economist at dexia .
" the party that got the most votes is a separatist party and it throws into question over a long timeframe , over a few years and longer ... who 's going to pay that debt back , " said peter chatwell , a strategist at credit agricole .
nothing changes , for now leterme 's administration will remain in charge until a new government is formed .
king albert ii met with leterme on monday and formally accepted his government 's resignation .

final official results released by the national electoral commission on monday show that the new flemish alliance -lrb- nva -rrb- secured 27 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament , up from just eight seats in 2007 .
the nva , led by 39-year-old bart de wever , ultimately wants to split the wealthy dutch-speaking flanders in the north from belgium 's poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia in the south .
de wever passionately advocates the end of belgium , calling its six million dutch-speakers and 4.5 million francophones a " hopeless mismatch . "
linguistic disputes have long hounded belgium and dominated the election campaign .
but a split-up of belgium after this election is unlikely .
french-speaking rivals come close second the french-speaking socialists -lrb- ps -rrb- with 26 seats are now the country 's second largest party .
the christian democrats , of outgoing prime minister yves leterme secured just 17 seats .
together , the nva and the ps would have just over one third of all the seats in parliament .
if the two parties , despite massive ideological differences , formed a coalition , then 58-year old ps leader elio di rupo could end up becoming belgium 's first french-speaking prime minister since 1974 , as de wever has said he does not want the job .
" you do n't have to like each other to work together , " said di rupo .
“ we french-speaking belgians must take a step towards our dutch-speaking counterparts , and vice versa , if we are to negotiate issues that we can not avoid for our country . ”
due to linguistic , political and economic differences , belgium has had four governments and three prime ministers since 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elio di rupo will have to make hard decisions about whether to join the government another long wait would worry financial markets long talks could worry financial markets .
analysts are concerned months of coalition talks could delay cuts to state spending .
" if in september we see that a government is n't being formed , if we see the crisis is prolonged , then we could see a market reaction at that time , " said jacques de pover , an economist at dexia .
" the party that got the most votes is a separatist party and it throws into question over a long timeframe , over a few years and longer ... who 's going to pay that debt back , " said peter chatwell , a strategist at credit agricole .
nothing changes , for now leterme 's administration will remain in charge until a new government is formed .
king albert ii met with leterme on monday and formally accepted his government 's resignation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 14.06.2010 asia needs green tigers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is the world 's largest co2 emitter at the recent world economic forum on east asia in vietnam , deutsche welle brought together governments and the corporate sector to debate the prospects of green growth in asia . polluted air , a lack of drinking water and overcrowded cities : it is well known that rapid economic growth has brought massive environmental challenges to the asian continent .
frans muller , a board member of germany 's metro group , admitted that these are serious problems , but he also pointed out that growing economies have an edge when it comes to being innovative .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus schwab speaks at the world economic forum on east asia " i think asia has not only a challenge , but also in this respect an enormous chance , " muller said .
" what you see is that more and more international companies establish their r & d centers in asia , particularly china , korea and japan ; and that a lot of technologies that are now a strength of asia , are linked to green technologies .
interfaces are possible : there are a lot of opportunities between the it sector in asia , which is very strong , and green technologies .
so there are a lot of opportunities that the green challenge will also bring green technology growth to industries in asia . "
governments lead the way in order to tap this potential , the role of governments is crucial .
many asian governments such as china and south korea have made green growth a policy priority .
south korea 's deputy environment minister yoon jong-soo explained what his administration has been doing to mobilize the citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese continue to rely heavily on highly polluting coal ...
he gave three examples : " one is the green start movement .
it is a nationwide campaign : we have to adopt a green lifestyle .
the second is the carbon point system : when households reduce carbon emissions and save energy , they get rewards in the form of cash or coupons .
the third is a ' carbon labeling ' system .
it provides information how much carbon dioxide has been emitted in the course of production , transportation and disposal of goods .
incentives are very important , rather than regulations . "
oil subsidies prevent innovation but stuart dean , who heads general electric in the asean region , cautioned that other policies in asia hinder growth in the green sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... but they also have become leading producers in solar technology " i think one of the areas that really need to be addressed early on is the area of subsidies for fossil fuels .
at least half of the countries in asia still have subsidies for fossil fuel , which then affect the pricing of electricity .
we recognize that there are socio-economic groups that benefit from those subsidies ; but i think it is also clear there are better ways to do income redistribution than subsidizing everyone 's use of fossil fuels . "
dean said europe became a leader in alternative energies only because high taxes made oil products expensive .
both industry and government representatives agreed that there is enormous potential for public-private partnerships in the realm of green growth .
with the right leadership , asia 's booming economies might soon become known as the " green tigers " .

so there are a lot of opportunities that the green challenge will also bring green technology growth to industries in asia . "
governments lead the way in order to tap this potential , the role of governments is crucial .
many asian governments such as china and south korea have made green growth a policy priority .

we recognize that there are socio-economic groups that benefit from those subsidies ; but i think it is also clear there are better ways to do income redistribution than subsidizing everyone 's use of fossil fuels . "
dean said europe became a leader in alternative energies only because high taxes made oil products expensive .
both industry and government representatives agreed that there is enormous potential for public-private partnerships in the realm of green growth .

zumwinkel welcomed the closing of the probe , which he said came to the conclusion that " any penal accusation against me is unfounded . "
" i regard this as a pleasant clarification , as a first-class termination of proceedings , " zumwinkel , who has denied any involvement in the spying , declared in bonn .
" it could not be better . "
the investigation was launched two years ago after deutsche telekom acknowledged that there were cases of misuse of call records in 2005 and 2006 .
germany 's journalists ' association djv criticized the outcome of the probe . " it is hard to imagine that the former telekom chiefs allegedly knew nothing about criminal interference into the freedom of the press , " djv chairman michael konken said .
eavesdropping scandal deutsche telekom ag was found to have monitored telephone records by senior executives and journalists to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws - and released a storm of public outrage .
the bonn prosecutors said on monday they were bringing charges against three telekom employees , including a leading security official .
the company has stressed that there is no suggestion that calls were tapped , but rather that call records detailing the time , participants and duration of calls were improperly monitored .

zumwinkel welcomed the closing of the probe , which he said came to the conclusion that " any penal accusation against me is unfounded . "
" i regard this as a pleasant clarification , as a first-class termination of proceedings , " zumwinkel , who has denied any involvement in the spying , declared in bonn .
" it could not be better . "
the investigation was launched two years ago after deutsche telekom acknowledged that there were cases of misuse of call records in 2005 and 2006 .
germany 's journalists ' association djv criticized the outcome of the probe . " it is hard to imagine that the former telekom chiefs allegedly knew nothing about criminal interference into the freedom of the press , " djv chairman michael konken said .
eavesdropping scandal deutsche telekom ag was found to have monitored telephone records by senior executives and journalists to track possible information leaks to media in a violation of data protection laws - and released a storm of public outrage .
the bonn prosecutors said on monday they were bringing charges against three telekom employees , including a leading security official .
the company has stressed that there is no suggestion that calls were tapped , but rather that call records detailing the time , participants and duration of calls were improperly monitored .

new delhi 's high court decriminalized homosexuality by striking down parts of the country 's colonial-era penal code .
but the fight has not stopped there .
the community is struggling for greater social acceptance and full legal rights . after last year 's historic verdict that ended state-sanctioned homophobia , india 's fledgling gay community is working to ensure that the delhi high court 's decisive verdict is not overturned in the supreme court .
but simultaneously , the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender or lgbt community as it is widely known , has begun fighting for legal rights .
gautam bhan , a prominent gay activist , outlines the roadmap ahead : " we have long said as part of the gay rights movement that the victory in the delhi high court last july , was not the victory that ended a battle .
it was a victory that began one .
i mean really the fight has started now .
decriminalization was the first step .
there is still no positive legal inclusion for gays and lesbians in the indian legal framework .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 14.06.2010 the continent has its world cup , but can an african nation actually win it ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's asamoah gyan scored the goal that gave africa its first win in the tournament the world cup had to wait for 82 years before it could come to an african nation .
now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .
daisuke matsui crossed from the right wing to the opposite side of the goal and found keisuke honda all alone .
honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .
a misguided header resulted in an own-goal , giving the netherlands the only goal they needed on their way to a 2-0 win .
bildunterschrift : simon poulsen 's header -lrb- right -rrb- deflected off daniel agger -lrb- center -rrb- and rolled into the danish goal just after both teams returned to the pitch following a scoreless first half , the netherlands had possession and were moving the ball down the pitch .
dutch striker robin van persie took a pass near the end line and crossed the ball in front of the goal .
danish defender daniel agger leapt for the ball to try and clear it , but it sailed over his head , leaving poulsen to head it out of the area .
but instead of clearing the ball , poulsen 's header glanced off agger 's back and rolled into the corner of his own goal .
danish keeper thomas sorensen was standing on the other side of the net and could only watch the ball trickle over the line .
the second goal for the netherlands involved a bit of luck as well .
dutch striker eljero elia took a shot from close range , which sorensen managed to get a hand on and deflect into the post .
the ball bounced back into play , where elia 's teammate dirk kuyt cleanly sent the rebound to the back of the net for the game 's final goal .
the netherlands and japan are tied on points at the top of group e , with the dutch having the better goal differential .

in their 2010 world cup debut , the defending champs have drawn against paraguay in a rainy group f match . it took more than a full half for italy 's offense to get going in tuesday night 's group f match against paraguay , but the defending world cup champions managed to find their footing and play to a 1-1 draw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcaraz was at the bottom of a jubilant pile following his goal in the 63rd minute , italian midfielder simone pepe delivered a low , fast corner right in front of the goal .
none of paraguay 's defenders got a touch on the ball before a sprinting daniele de rossi slid in and drove home the goal . paraguay 's goal came near the end of the first half .
aureliano torres sent a perfect free kick from distance to the top of the goal box , where antolin alcaraz got the best jump and connected for a header in the 39th minute . nearly four years ago , italy celebrated its fourth world cup title with a penalty shootout victory over france .
for this year 's world cup , coach marcello lippi has selected nine players from the 2006 team , giving the italians one of the oldest teams in the tournament . the azzurri are led by long-time national defender fabio cannavaro , who is making his fourth world cup appearance . before the match in cape town , hundreds of security stewards walked off the job in a labor dispute over wages .
local police have taken over security duties at green point stadium , and the game was not delayed . japan holds on earlier in the day , japan did n't get many chances to score against cameroon in group e , but it only took one solid offensive sequence to give the japanese a 1-0 victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda received the cross beautifully before scoring japan 's goal came in the 39th minute from a textbook cross play .
daisuke matsui crossed from the right wing to the opposite side of the goal and found keisuke honda all alone .
honda briefly controlled the ball and then slipped it past cameroon 's keeper hamidou souleymanou . the japanese spent most of the game fighting off attacking waves from cameroon , who were led by striker samuel eto 'o .
the second half in particular seemed to feature constant tries by cameroon to set up plays , only to have the ball cleared time and again by the japanese .
shots that did find their way to the goal were cleanly handled by japan 's eiji kawashima , who had a good day between the posts . cameroon 's defender stephane mbia very nearly got the equalizer five minutes before time with a thundering blast from well outside the area that rattled the crossbar . headed for an own goal danish defender simon poulsen inadvertently took the idea of " keep your head in the game " too far in denmark 's group e match against the netherlands in johannesburg .
a misguided header resulted in an own-goal , giving the netherlands the only goal they needed on their way to a 2-0 win .
bildunterschrift : simon poulsen 's header -lrb- right -rrb- deflected off daniel agger -lrb- center -rrb- and rolled into the danish goal just after both teams returned to the pitch following a scoreless first half , the netherlands had possession and were moving the ball down the pitch .
dutch striker robin van persie took a pass near the end line and crossed the ball in front of the goal .
danish defender daniel agger leapt for the ball to try and clear it , but it sailed over his head , leaving poulsen to head it out of the area .
but instead of clearing the ball , poulsen 's header glanced off agger 's back and rolled into the corner of his own goal .
danish keeper thomas sorensen was standing on the other side of the net and could only watch the ball trickle over the line .
the second goal for the netherlands involved a bit of luck as well .
dutch striker eljero elia took a shot from close range , which sorensen managed to get a hand on and deflect into the post .
the ball bounced back into play , where elia 's teammate dirk kuyt cleanly sent the rebound to the back of the net for the game 's final goal .
the netherlands and japan are tied on points at the top of group e , with the dutch having the better goal differential .

but he and others are warning against exaggerating the significance of that victory . everybody loves a winner .
germany 's one-sided demolition of australia on sunday prompted frenetic celebrations in public viewing areas and parades of flag-flying , honking cars in the nation 's cities .
monday morning newspapers and television programs were hardly less euphoric in hailing the victory .
" this will be our world cup , " proclaimed germany 's leading tabloid bild .
" loew was proven right in all respects . "

but he and others are warning against exaggerating the significance of that victory . everybody loves a winner .
germany 's one-sided demolition of australia on sunday prompted frenetic celebrations in public viewing areas and parades of flag-flying , honking cars in the nation 's cities .
monday morning newspapers and television programs were hardly less euphoric in hailing the victory .
" this will be our world cup , " proclaimed germany 's leading tabloid bild .
" loew was proven right in all respects . "
former german national goalkeeper toni schumacher seconded those sentiments .
" despite all the criticism , loew did everything right , " the goalkeeping legend told the public television station zdf .
ironically , though , many of those now singing loew 's praises are the same ones who criticized the national team coach for sticking with out-of-form veterans miroslav klose and lukas podolski just a few days previously .
and cooler heads are cautioning fans not to read too much into one convincing result .
one of them is loew himself .
no euphoria , please bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were smiles all around after the big win right after the match , the 50-year-old coach was doing his best to dampen expectations .
when asked if he thought he had done everything right , loew said no .
" we 've still got things to improve , " loew told reporters .
" we all know australia is n't the absolute measure of things , and of course we 'll face tougher tests in the tournament ... there 's no reason for euphoria . "
the coach did , however , take the opportunity to reiterate the logic behind starting podolski and klose , who both scored against australia .
" miroslav klose has been with us since 2002 and has scored 11 world cup goals , " loew said .
" -lsb- podolski -rsb- played his first tournament in 2004 and has always been one of our best players .
i know i can trust these players , even if they do have patchy stretches . "
indeed , after a wretched club season with cologne , podolski looked convincing .
he was an active and integrated part of germany 's midfield , and the shot that opened the scoring against australia was measured at 126 kilometers -lrb- 78 miles -rrb- per hour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose broke a long scoring drought with his header klose 's performance was more ambiguous .
the goal he headed in the first half showcased one of the striker 's strengths .
but the three sitters he missed were also indications of why he spent much of this past season on bayern munich 's bench .
on the other hand , youngsters thomas mueller and mesut oezil doubtlessly deserve the praise they are receiving , as germany 's offense clicked on all cylinders against the overmatched australians .
still open questions more football-savvy commentators agreed that the socceroos , a team loew had talked up before the game , were not the sort of opponents to truly test the squad .
" neither did the supposedly fearsome australians break any legs , nor did they pose much of an offensive threat after the fourth minute , " sports reporter christina goedecke wrote in the newsmagazine der spiegel .
" after podolski made it 1-0 , their defensive strategy flew out the window . "
ahead of the world cup , many people worried whether sami khedira could replace the injured michael ballack in midfield and whether the central defense of per mertesacker and arne friedrich would hold up under pressure .
bildunterschrift : sami khedira was n't unduly troubled by australia 's luke wilkshire all three of those players looked good on sunday .
but then again , it would have been difficult not to look good against australia , who played without a true striker and then went down a in the first half .
the same goes for germany 's new no. 1 goalkeeper , 24-year-old manuel neuer , who was hardly tested in the match .
germany 's next game is against serbia on friday , and loew is already building them up as tougher foes .
but given their lackluster loss to ghana on sunday , the serbians may not pose a top-level test either .
indeed , germany may have to wait until the knock-out stages to find out how they measure up against the real competition for the title .
that 's the kind of problem , though , that all teams like to have .
so in the meantime , the press and fans can keep up the enthusiasm generated by the most impressive start of any team thus far in the world cup .
and loew 's new reputation as a footballing genius will survive at least for the next couple of days .

it 's the small things that can stop a team in the next round .
each player has a job to do .
you must stay humble and ready for the next game . - malcolm , canada good article by nick amies .
it seems churlish to talk down the excellent display of the german national team against australia , but one must look at the early formline like any good horseracing enthusiast would .
this was a very poor australian team , reduced to ten men in the second half .
if germany can take out serbia without problems then i will probably become a believer , as i feel confident that they can beat ghana -lrb- weakened by the absence of michael essien -rrb- comfortably .
the german media -lrb- especially the three incredible tabloids -rrb- are whipping the good citizens up into a frenzy , but , i repeat , this early formline is flawed , without a doubt .
let 's therefore hang-on a bit and wait for serbia ? - fred , germany congratulations on winning the match versus australia with this first ideal performance and score of my beloved deutschland national team in this world cup .
podolski , who played a key role in this match , i had every confidence and very sure that you would head up your group and you would be number one player .

keep up the good performance !

it 's the small things that can stop a team in the next round .
each player has a job to do .
you must stay humble and ready for the next game . - malcolm , canada good article by nick amies .
it seems churlish to talk down the excellent display of the german national team against australia , but one must look at the early formline like any good horseracing enthusiast would .
this was a very poor australian team , reduced to ten men in the second half .
if germany can take out serbia without problems then i will probably become a believer , as i feel confident that they can beat ghana -lrb- weakened by the absence of michael essien -rrb- comfortably .
the german media -lrb- especially the three incredible tabloids -rrb- are whipping the good citizens up into a frenzy , but , i repeat , this early formline is flawed , without a doubt .
let 's therefore hang-on a bit and wait for serbia ? - fred , germany congratulations on winning the match versus australia with this first ideal performance and score of my beloved deutschland national team in this world cup .
podolski , who played a key role in this match , i had every confidence and very sure that you would head up your group and you would be number one player .

the mexican referee deliberately missed a handball by a german player in the box early in the second half and should have awarded a penalty to australia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

visitors are invited to walk all over them - and rethink energy use and climate change . it 's not your typical museum .
those who want to experience the ruhr atoll art project up close have to take a paddle boat to get there .
and touching the work wo n't draw nasty looks from some museum employees - quiet the opposite actually , it 's strongly encouraged . the 300-square-meter -lrb- about 3,200-square-foot -rrb- installation is particularly child-friendly , said the mastermind behind the project , artist norbert bauer .
his aim is to make art accessible . " i think art can and should always be fun , " he said .
" i 'm not going to take it all so deadly seriously . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bauer 's vision for the ruhr atoll was a product of runner 's endorphines , he said located in the middle of the six-kilometer-long -lrb- 3.7-mile -rrb- lake baldeney reservoir , bauer 's work includes an iceberg , an abandoned submarine , a teahouse and a rusty waterworks .
it was created because nearby essen and the surrounding ruhr region - historically , germany 's heart of heavy industry - were selected as europe 's 2010 capital of culture . " i ca n't say if it has great public significance , " said passer-by johannes limbeck of the atoll , " but it 's interesting to stand up here and look down at lake baldeney and see something other than little boats . " limbeck is one of three million visitors who make their way to essen 's reservoir each year to enjoy the water and the sunshine .
it 's precisely these unsuspecting lake-lovers that bauer wants to impact with his art . " art is there to be touched , " he said .
" i reach the people who do n't go to museums . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the outside , the submarine is an ominous symbol of war walk-in installations bauer explained that he had a vision for the atoll project while training for a marathon 15 years ago .
it remained just a picture in his head , however , until , a decade later , he invited artists to develop ideas for an island installation based on the theme " energy and movement . "
for the european cultural capital year , 24 models were selected , but funding only allowed for five to be realized . the artificial iceberg , positioned in lake baldeney as a clear reference to climate change , was developed by artist andreas kaiser , together with physicist and polar researcher lars kindermann .
it is a walk-in sculpture , with a research tent placed on top .
during the night , the tent lights up and realistic nature sounds - like thunder and ocean waves - are broadcast from it . nearby , the grey tower of a stranded submarine , designed by artist andreas kaufmann and media expert hans ullrich reck , juts out of the water .
it is a symbol of the conflicts and wars that are fought over energy resources , said ruhr atoll spokesman holger kruessmann . " but the effect when we enter the submarine is that this weapon is transformed into a chapel on the inside ; it practically seems like a church , " he explained . on the inside of the submarine 's tower , the words " i can , because i want to , which i have to " are spelled out in a collage made of hundreds of press photographs .
the resulting mosaic resembles a stained-glass window in a church . bildunterschrift : the inside of the submarine resembles stained-glass windows island of absurdity norbert bauer 's favorite part of the ruhr atoll is the island called " project to preserve natural resources , " designed by renowned russian installation artist ilya kabakov .
the island is a piece of absurdistan , joked bauer .
kabakov has turned the renewable energy discussion on its head - in a ridiculous way , he added . on the island , water is pumped through rusty pipes and boilers , then passes through a series of whimsical-looking filters that are powered by wind energy and diesel motors .
the water then flows through a mock laboratory before landing once again in the lake . " it was really fun putting it together with a mechanic , " said bauer . spokesman kruessmann said the great irony behind the model island is that there 's plenty of rattling , clanging and moving parts that give the impression of productivity , " but really nothing happens except that the water is transferred from left to right . " at the end of the year , when essen 's title as culture capital is passed on , the island will be transported to different waters .
norbert bauer is in the process of looking for buyers for the various objects that make up the ruhr atoll .
kabakov 's absurd island is going for around 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 360,000 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : kabakov 's island is a picture of ironic absurdity author : bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- photos : per henriksen editor : sue cox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .
with the germans expected to go through as group winners , ghana can not afford to slip up if they want to reach the knock-out stages .
a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

a potential last 16 clash with england could be the reward .
it 's anyone 's guess as to which way that one would go .
indomitable lions come roaring back bildunterschrift : cameroon 's iconic captain samuel eto 'o is back at the world cup with the indomitable lions eto 'o and cameroon are back at the world cup after missing out on the 2006 tournament and have a squad shot through with exciting young players .
french coach paul le guen has built a lions indomptables team with impressive midfielders jean makoun and alex song at its heart and inter milan forward eto 'o leading its attack .
where the lions are not so indomitable , however , are in defense .
with attack-minded holland likely to top group e , cameroon will hope their shaky defense – which conceded seven goals in its last two pre-tournament friendlies – will hold against denmark and japan , earning the lions a possible knock-out clash with world champions italy .
a young team of heart and sporadic flair may fancy its chances against an ageing italy side but may come unstuck against more spritely sides if they get any further .
the hosts obviously have more than just continental advantage ; their home advantage is something that can not be discounted at any tournament .
with a crowd full of ecstatic fans and with the vuvuzelas at full volume , south africa has the power of a nation mesmerized by the world cup behind them .
so enthralled are the south africans in their team , that the belief and wonder in the stands can not fail to make it onto the pitch .
south africa hoping to benefit from home advantage bildunterschrift : south africa 's colourful , noisy supporters will play an important part in the team 's progress bafana bafana entered the tournament on the back of a 12-match unbeaten run and extended that in its first world cup game , the 1-1 draw with mexico .
it 's currently all square in group a with france and uruguay also drawing in a dour 0-0 stalemate .
france look short of ideas and continuity and while uruguay looked dangerous , they could n't break down an uninspiring french team .
after surprising the offensively minded mexicans , south africa look good to get at least a point from their game against france and could also get the better of the uruguayans .
for the sake of the tournament , it would be great to see bafana bafana progress to the knock-out stages .
no-one likes it when the host nation crashes out early .
should they get through as either winners or second-placed qualifiers in group a , the hosts could meet either south korea or argentina .
they will be hoping they get the koreans .
those wanting the party to continue will hope so too , although their chances of going any further will depend on the luck of the draw and the power of the crowd .
this world cup has already proved that africa has come a long way by staging the event .
ivory coast , ghana , cameroon and south africa are the most likely teams to show how far progress on the pitch has come .
however , despite the romance that may be generated by the vision of an african nation lifting the trophy , the wait is likely to continue past the 2010 tournament .

now the question remains : how long will it take for an african nation to lift the trophy ? could the fact that the greatest soccer tournament on earth is taking place on the african continent be the final incentive needed for one of its teams to step out of the shadow of the europeans and south americans ?
brazil legend pele famously made a prediction that an african nation would lift the world cup by the end of the 20th century .
he may have been proved wrong but it was n't through want of trying by the afrcians .
african teams have been steadily improving and their biggest stars are no longer just local legends but among the biggest names in world football .
is it therefore time for a didier drogba -lrb- if fit -rrb- or samuel eto 'o to raise the trophy aloft now that the continent has come just as far ?
south africa , algeria , nigeria , ghana , cameroon and the ivory coast all carry the hopes of their individual nations and the continent as a whole coming into the 2010 world cup , but in reality , ghana , ivory coast , cameroon and perhaps the host nation stand the best chance of reaching the latter stages .
the ivory coast , now under the guidance of former england and mexico coach sven goran eriksson , have been unfairly called a one-man team .
while drogba is hugely influential , as striker and captain , it is an insult to the likes of emmanuel eboue , aruna dindane , salmon kalou and the brothers kolo and yaya touré to suggest that the elephants will struggle if drogba fails to recover from a broken arm .
ivory coast need to be at their best bildunterschrift : ivory coast 's didier drogba is hugely inspirational but the elelphants are far from a one-man team the elephants find themselves in a group with brazil , portugal and north korea .
victory over north korea should be expected but getting past brazil and portugal will be much harder .
it is a daunting task .
but why should n't the ivory coast escape the group of death at the expense of kaka or cristiano ronaldo ?
while brazil and portugal have hugely talented squads , the elephants also boast players from the english and spanish champions as well as stars from other top teams from around europe . if they can get through as the second qualifying team in group g they could face european champions spain , the likely winners of group h. that would be an even more daunting task and one which may be too much for the elephants to contend with .
qualifying from group g would be an achievement in itself but the ivory coast may find the going too tough in the knock-out round .
black stars hoping to qualify with germany bildunterschrift : ghana 's black stars have high hopes of progressing but wo n't be drawn on their title credentials ghana is regularly spoken about as a future world cup winning nation but questions still remain about whether that future is here and now .
the ghanaians themselves are keeping out of the debate over whether they can lift the trophy but are still confident of making the latter stages .
the black stars made it to the last 16 in germany in 2006 and this year have a much stronger squad , despite the loss of influential skipper michael essien and fitness concerns over inter milan midfielder sulley muntari .
hopes are high of at least a semi-final placing in 2010 but first they will have to qualify from group d , which also features serbia , germany and australia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de belgium -pipe- 14.06.2010 belgian separatist party wins election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de wever wants in the end to split belgium parliamentary election results in belgium are expected to do little to ease decades of tensions between the wealthy flanders in the north of the country , and the poorer french-speaking walloons in the south . belgium has begun the search for a coalition government after right-wing flemish separatists won sunday 's parliamentary election .
final official results released by the national electoral commission on monday show that the new flemish alliance -lrb- nva -rrb- secured 27 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament , up from just eight seats in 2007 .
the nva , led by 39-year-old bart de wever , ultimately wants to split the wealthy dutch-speaking flanders in the north from belgium 's poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia in the south .
de wever passionately advocates the end of belgium , calling its six million dutch-speakers and 4.5 million francophones a " hopeless mismatch . "
linguistic disputes have long hounded belgium and dominated the election campaign .
but a split-up of belgium after this election is unlikely .
french-speaking rivals come close second the french-speaking socialists -lrb- ps -rrb- with 26 seats are now the country 's second largest party .
the christian democrats , of outgoing prime minister yves leterme secured just 17 seats .
together , the nva and the ps would have just over one third of all the seats in parliament .
if the two parties , despite massive ideological differences , formed a coalition , then 58-year old ps leader elio di rupo could end up becoming belgium 's first french-speaking prime minister since 1974 , as de wever has said he does not want the job .
" you do n't have to like each other to work together , " said di rupo .
“ we french-speaking belgians must take a step towards our dutch-speaking counterparts , and vice versa , if we are to negotiate issues that we can not avoid for our country . ”
due to linguistic , political and economic differences , belgium has had four governments and three prime ministers since 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elio di rupo will have to make hard decisions about whether to join the government another long wait would worry financial markets long talks could worry financial markets .
analysts are concerned months of coalition talks could delay cuts to state spending .
" if in september we see that a government is n't being formed , if we see the crisis is prolonged , then we could see a market reaction at that time , " said jacques de pover , an economist at dexia .
" the party that got the most votes is a separatist party and it throws into question over a long timeframe , over a few years and longer ... who 's going to pay that debt back , " said peter chatwell , a strategist at credit agricole .
nothing changes , for now leterme 's administration will remain in charge until a new government is formed .
king albert ii met with leterme on monday and formally accepted his government 's resignation .
the king also received the heads of both houses of parliament and begun holding talks with party leaders including de wever .
leterme is still expected to be in office when belgium takes on the six-month rotating presidency of the 27-member eu on july 1 .
the european commission has expressed confidence that belgium 's own political troubles will not affect its ability to handle eu policy matters during the six months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 14.06.2010 kyrgyzstan unrest adds new edge to global powers ' regional rivalry 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kyrgyzstan 's violence has implications beyond its borders as politically and ethnically-charged violence continues in kyrgyzstan , three powerful nations who have hugely important strategic and geopolitical interests in the region are becoming particularly concerned . the central asian nation 's worst ethnic violence in decades , which has reportedly left at least 179 people dead , many more injured and has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes , has wider implications in a region full of strategic and geopolitical importance for the world 's biggest powers .
the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

the violence that erupted on friday between kyrgyz and uzbek clans may have been ignited by the escalating tensions between the country 's two dominant ethnic groups but the conditions for the fighting have been created by the on-going unstable political situation in kyrgyzstan ; a situation that has the fingerprints of the world 's most influential nations all over it .
kyrgyzstan 's wider role in international affairs is such that russia and the united states continue to jostle for military influence there while china , which shares a 530-mile border with kyrgyzstan , pursues significant strategic and economic interests in the country and its surrounding region .
this most recent uprising stems from the ousting of the washington-friendly regime of president kurmanbek bakiyev in april which left the country in turmoil .
bakiyev 's removal from power and the rise to power of the current provisional government has not only allowed ethnic tensions to reach boiling point in kyrgyzstan but could trigger a new struggle for proxy control of the country and the regional benefits which come with it .
bakiyev 's installation as president in 2005 with us backing may have provided washington with a friendly government with whom to do business with but it also gave the us a significant foothold in a country that some strategists believe is paramount to its plans for regional dominance .
regional unrest could put us objectives under threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest may put the us base at manas under threat experts say that it has been a prime us strategic objective to increase its influence in the former soviet states of central asia since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
the inclusion of kyrgyzstan and three other central asian states in nato 's partnership for peace program in 1994 , was seen as a major step toward increasing us military presence in the region which eventually led to the us base at manas , outside bishkek in the north , being established .
" during the april unrest , the us manas airbase was closed and the vital supply route for sending military hardware and troops to afghanistan was not being used , " asher pirt , an expert on central asian affairs and military issues , told deutsche welle .
" the us needs a stable kyrgyzstan in order to keep the supply route working . "
" there is also the possibility of uzbek intervention in the restive osh region due to the fact that uzbeks are being killed and hurt in the violence and any such intervention is likely to lead to further instability and will continue cause problems with the us principle supply route to afghanistan and its troops deployed there , " he added .
" another issue is if the instability spreads throughout the rest of central asia and there is a rise of islamic extremism this could significantly affect us interests in the region . ”
us presence increases russia 's concern over nato plans while manas remains a key hub for us operations in afghanistan , it is also used as a nato base - a situation which angers and concerns russia which fears the eastern enlargement of its former cold war opponent , putting kyrgyzstan at the center of a power struggle for regional influence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev wants a friendly government in bishkek " the current unrest is a major threat to the authority of the kyrgyz government , " dex torrike-barton , an international security analyst , told deutsche welle from kyrgyzstan .
" the provisional government is still very weak .
if violence spreads beyond the cities currently affected , then we could see major political instability .
in that context , all bets are off the table on whether the us can retain its airbase in the country .
there are plenty of political factions in kyrgyzstan who do n't want to see the americans keep any sort of foothold in the country .
if russia or the collective security treaty organisation - the regional defence alliance - ultimately ends up intervening , the same result is likely . "
russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

russia , which itself has its own military base at the kant airbase near bishkek and a strategic naval base on lake issyk-kul , is highly suspicious of the united states ' interest in kyrgyzstan and the wider eurasian region .
since the us-backed bakiyev regime was ousted in april , moscow has unsurprisingly been the biggest supporter of the new provisional government , presumably in the hope that if order is restored the swing of influence will return to russia .
washington 's plans for the regions sit very uncomfortably with the kremlin .
while the us may justify that its increased influence is mutually beneficial by claiming its presence will help stop the spread of islamic fundamentalism in central asia and solve the hugely destabilizing problem of afghanistan , russia believes the us has another agenda .
the kremlin says that washington is aiming to prevent russian and / or chinese hegemony while securing energy resources and pipelines .

final official results released by the national electoral commission on monday show that the new flemish alliance -lrb- nva -rrb- secured 27 seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament , up from just eight seats in 2007 .
the nva , led by 39-year-old bart de wever , ultimately wants to split the wealthy dutch-speaking flanders in the north from belgium 's poorer , french-speaking region of wallonia in the south .
de wever passionately advocates the end of belgium , calling its six million dutch-speakers and 4.5 million francophones a " hopeless mismatch . "
linguistic disputes have long hounded belgium and dominated the election campaign .
but a split-up of belgium after this election is unlikely .
french-speaking rivals come close second the french-speaking socialists -lrb- ps -rrb- with 26 seats are now the country 's second largest party .
the christian democrats , of outgoing prime minister yves leterme secured just 17 seats .
together , the nva and the ps would have just over one third of all the seats in parliament .
if the two parties , despite massive ideological differences , formed a coalition , then 58-year old ps leader elio di rupo could end up becoming belgium 's first french-speaking prime minister since 1974 , as de wever has said he does not want the job .
" you do n't have to like each other to work together , " said di rupo .
“ we french-speaking belgians must take a step towards our dutch-speaking counterparts , and vice versa , if we are to negotiate issues that we can not avoid for our country . ”
due to linguistic , political and economic differences , belgium has had four governments and three prime ministers since 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elio di rupo will have to make hard decisions about whether to join the government another long wait would worry financial markets long talks could worry financial markets .
analysts are concerned months of coalition talks could delay cuts to state spending .
" if in september we see that a government is n't being formed , if we see the crisis is prolonged , then we could see a market reaction at that time , " said jacques de pover , an economist at dexia .
" the party that got the most votes is a separatist party and it throws into question over a long timeframe , over a few years and longer ... who 's going to pay that debt back , " said peter chatwell , a strategist at credit agricole .
nothing changes , for now leterme 's administration will remain in charge until a new government is formed .
king albert ii met with leterme on monday and formally accepted his government 's resignation .
the king also received the heads of both houses of parliament and begun holding talks with party leaders including de wever .
leterme is still expected to be in office when belgium takes on the six-month rotating presidency of the 27-member eu on july 1 .
the european commission has expressed confidence that belgium 's own political troubles will not affect its ability to handle eu policy matters during the six months .
