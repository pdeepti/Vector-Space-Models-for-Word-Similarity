it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

" the desire is to do it in the most transparent way possible , including by presenting the exposure of different institutions to sovereign debt , " belgian finance minister didier reynders , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told a news conference .
while france questions the need to fully publish exposure to sovereign debt and stressed the difficulty of establishing a harmonized tier one - or capital - ratio for european banks , germany , spain and britain are in favor of full disclosure , according to the reuters news agency , quoting unnamed sources .
avoiding bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the eu is prepared if banks fail the stress tests eu ministers agreed that any bank pushed to the brink of collapse would be eligible for a state bailout , but with strict conditions attached .
" first , an institution which is in trouble should raise capital on the markets .
if this does not work , the state should help .
if the state is not in a position to do it ... the state can turn to the -lsb- rescue system -rsb- , but only under the conditions which the rules impose , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on tuesday .
some german and spanish banks are seen as the weakest links in the european banking system .
according to a study by pricewaterhousecoopers , german banks had the highest number of bad loans on their books at the end of 2009 , amounting to over 212 billion euros -lrb- $ 269 -rrb- .
doubts over banks ' abilities to clean up their balance sheets have hampered efforts to raise funding and made them dependent on liquidity provided by the european central bank in the wake of the global financial crisis .

" the powers of the european agencies are focused on areas where there is dispute about a point of law , rather than allowing them to become involved in day-to-day supervision or second guessing the discretion of national supervisors , " uk finance minister george osborne said .
britain , home to europe 's biggest financial sector , had insisted that a pan-european body should not interfere with member states ' fiscal sovereignty .

cambodia is the country most affected outside the south asian subcontinent . the cambodian acid survivors charity -lrb- casc -rrb- is based at a house on a hectare of land outside phnom penh .
in the front room a group of a dozen men and women are resting or getting physiotherapy treatment .
all have been burned by acid . statistics from casc show that more than half of acid victims are deliberately attacked .
casc has recorded 103 people burned with acid in the past five years , with another 16 so far this year .
but its coordinator ziad samman says the true number is likely far higher since casc sees only a fraction of those hurt . easy availability of acid acid is cheap , widely used , and easily available in cambodia .
it delivers an extraordinarily graphic injury .
in a deliberate attack , acid is often poured over the victim 's face .
it takes just seconds to melt facial features , and keeps burning through skin and even bone .
those who survive typically bear terrible scars . in recent years the rising number of acid attacks has put pressure on the government to act .
it recently drafted a law to deal with the problem . " the government is dead serious .
this can not go on , " says sieng lapresse , a senior official at the ministry of interior .
" we do not allow this horrible weapon to kill our society and our own people . " bildunterschrift : acid attack survivors in the treatment room at casc , the cambodian acid survivors charity , outside phnom penh new law against the crime sieng lapresse has been tasked with collating the draft law .
he says the law , which should be passed before the end of the year , will regulate sales of acid , with vendors bearing legal responsibility for those to whom they sell it .
penalties for those found guilty of throwing acid will be severe . " we are looking for from at least ten years to life in prison , " he says . samman says people have a number of misconceptions about acid attacks : many are surprised to learn that men comprise around half of casc 's 260 clients over the years . saroeun is one such victim .
until six months ago he worked as a security guard at a hotel in phnom penh , when an attacker poured acid on him .
his face and right arm bear significant scarring .
he welcomes the proposed new law . " the new law is very significant for khmer society as it targets those people who want to throw acid , " says saroeun .
" i really want the government to strongly enforce this law against people who throw acid , because acid causes a lot of suffering and has a very dangerous effect . " raising awareness saroeun would also like the government to outlaw discrimination by employers against people with disabilities . casc 's anecdotal research indicates many people do not regard throwing acid as a crime .
educating about that and about how to provide first aid for victims - pouring water over the burn to dilute the acid - would also help . one problem the law is unlikely to resolve is impunity for powerful people who have been behind several high-profile attacks in recent years . author : robert carmichael -lrb- phnom penh -rrb- editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.07.2010 paul the octopus retires , but a future in spain beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oracle paul has become famous paul the octopus was an uncanny judge of germany 's world cup fortunes .
now , he can relax and retire in his aquarium in oberhausen , in northern germany .
a village in spain , however , would like to give him a new home . for weeks during the world cup , long lines formed in front of the sea life aquarium in oberhausen despite the summer heat , with people waiting patiently to enter the park .
an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .
and paul is an attraction .
paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .
two years ago , during the european football championship , paul gave the first samples of his abilities as an oracle .
how does he do it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul correctly picked the winner of all of germany 's matches paul loves mussels . during the 2008 tournament , someone came up with the idea to take two glass containers , drape each with the flag of one of the competing teams , and place a mussel inside .
enter paul the octopus , who would hover over the boxes , choose one of the mussels and fish it out - thus predicting which team would win that particular match .
sounds easy , but it is n't .
the aquarium followed the same procedure this year during the world cup , and paul was right every time . people wondered how he did it , and turned to scientists .
as it turns out , there are plenty of answers , not all of them scientific .
favorite color or sense of smell ?
one explanation : the color combination .
maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .
but even in this case , the prediction 's concurrence with the actual outcome of the match leaves too much room for coincidence .
bildunterschrift : many a german wished this fate on paul bodyguards for an octopus be that as it may , paul has gained worldwide fame . and like every other star , he does n't only have fans .
threats from disappointed german and dutch soccer fans can be found on the internet under " octopus paul , we know where your tank is . "
the internet was swamped by octopus recipes and pictures of octopuses hung out to dry .
a video on youtube showed brutal scenes from chinese restaurants , where live octopuses were tossed into a boiling liquid .
but none of that really matters to cuddly paul in his oberhausen aquarium .
sea life arranged for 24 hour ' security ' for the animal , successfully fending off any cowardly attacks .
retired octopus now that the world cup is over , the hoopla has died down somewhat .
which is a good thing .
after all , paul is two-and-a-half years old , a respectable age for an octopus .
he needs his rest .
as a matter of fact , paul might not be around much longer . while sea life wants to make sure he is content until he dies , paul 's fans do n't want him to retire .
the aquarium receives hundreds of emails every day with oracle questions for the mollusk .
questions like : " how long will merkel 's coalition last ? " or " am i going to get a d in math this year ? " are fun , but paul , according to scientific expertise , ca n't answer them .
so , in the end , the soothsaying octopus can peacefully swim through his tank toward that eternal resting place under water .
spain misses out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paella is not to be the famous oracle 's fate after all a generous offer from spain is not likely to change his fate .
a village in the northwestern part of the country has collected money and would like to buy paul for 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,720 -rrb- .
they want him to perform , though not as an oracle but as a mascot for a food festival with plenty of octopus specialties on the menu . evil be to him who evil thinks ...
but sea life in oberhausen wo n't be swayed by the tempting offer .
oberhausen is where paul will stay , where it 's clear this octopus is not going to end up in a paella .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.07.2010 paul the octopus retires , but a future in spain beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oracle paul has become famous paul the octopus was an uncanny judge of germany 's world cup fortunes .
now , he can relax and retire in his aquarium in oberhausen , in northern germany .
a village in spain , however , would like to give him a new home . for weeks during the world cup , long lines formed in front of the sea life aquarium in oberhausen despite the summer heat , with people waiting patiently to enter the park .
an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .
and paul is an attraction .
paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .
two years ago , during the european football championship , paul gave the first samples of his abilities as an oracle .
how does he do it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul correctly picked the winner of all of germany 's matches paul loves mussels . during the 2008 tournament , someone came up with the idea to take two glass containers , drape each with the flag of one of the competing teams , and place a mussel inside .
enter paul the octopus , who would hover over the boxes , choose one of the mussels and fish it out - thus predicting which team would win that particular match .
sounds easy , but it is n't .
the aquarium followed the same procedure this year during the world cup , and paul was right every time . people wondered how he did it , and turned to scientists .
as it turns out , there are plenty of answers , not all of them scientific .
favorite color or sense of smell ?
one explanation : the color combination .
maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .
but even in this case , the prediction 's concurrence with the actual outcome of the match leaves too much room for coincidence .
bildunterschrift : many a german wished this fate on paul bodyguards for an octopus be that as it may , paul has gained worldwide fame . and like every other star , he does n't only have fans .
threats from disappointed german and dutch soccer fans can be found on the internet under " octopus paul , we know where your tank is . "
the internet was swamped by octopus recipes and pictures of octopuses hung out to dry .
a video on youtube showed brutal scenes from chinese restaurants , where live octopuses were tossed into a boiling liquid .
but none of that really matters to cuddly paul in his oberhausen aquarium .
sea life arranged for 24 hour ' security ' for the animal , successfully fending off any cowardly attacks .
retired octopus now that the world cup is over , the hoopla has died down somewhat .
which is a good thing .
after all , paul is two-and-a-half years old , a respectable age for an octopus .
he needs his rest .
as a matter of fact , paul might not be around much longer . while sea life wants to make sure he is content until he dies , paul 's fans do n't want him to retire .
the aquarium receives hundreds of emails every day with oracle questions for the mollusk .
questions like : " how long will merkel 's coalition last ? " or " am i going to get a d in math this year ? " are fun , but paul , according to scientific expertise , ca n't answer them .
so , in the end , the soothsaying octopus can peacefully swim through his tank toward that eternal resting place under water .
spain misses out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paella is not to be the famous oracle 's fate after all a generous offer from spain is not likely to change his fate .
a village in the northwestern part of the country has collected money and would like to buy paul for 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,720 -rrb- .
they want him to perform , though not as an oracle but as a mascot for a food festival with plenty of octopus specialties on the menu . evil be to him who evil thinks ...
but sea life in oberhausen wo n't be swayed by the tempting offer .
oberhausen is where paul will stay , where it 's clear this octopus is not going to end up in a paella .

the market reaction , however , was muted . moody 's investor service , the international ratings agency , lowered portugal 's sovereign debt rating on tuesday by two grades to a1 from aa2 .
the agency said the country 's growth is still weak and that its debt continues to climb .
it said it expected portugal 's debt troubles to continue for the next two to three years and called on the government to enact further austerity measures in the 2011 budget .
the euro dropped to a one-week low of $ 1.2533 .
the wider market reaction was muted , however , as moody 's is only playing catch-up with rival agency standard & poor 's , which still rates portuguese debt two notches lower at a- .
" it does n't have the same impact as it would if the likes of s & p were to downgrade , given the move only brings -lsb- moody 's -rsb- in line , " sean maloney , a rate strategist at nomura , told reuters news agency .
city index analyst joshua raymond agreed , telling the afp wire service , " i do not think this took a lot of investors by surprise this morning , which is why the market reaction for europe as a whole has not been too severe thus far . "
" what the cut does do , however , is reaffirm the fragility of credit ratings for those countries with high debts and any cut in credit ratings is likely to be seen as a vote of no confidence , " he added .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .

" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.07.2010 bp claims ' significant progress ' in battle to cap oil well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp confirms a well cap is in place to stem flow of oil from ruptured pipeline thirteen weeks after the oil catastrophe in the gulf of mexico , bp says it has successfully installed a cap to stop of the flow of oil into the sea .
tests on tuesday will determine if the oil spill has been stopped . " we have made significant progress .
this could lead to the shutting of the well , " admiral thad allen , head of the us government response effort , told the nbc television network on monday .
he was referring to the latest attempt to halt the massive oil slick in the gulf of mexico - which is still spewing vast amounts of crude into the ocean every day - by using underwater robots to install a new cap over the ruptured well .
" this containment cap will have the ability to actually close down valves and slowly contain all the oil , " allen said in another interview with news network cnn .
he said it will be possible to see how much pressure is in the well which will help determine whether or not its possible to shut the well for a period of time " , allen said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admiral thad allen , head of response effort , says progress is at hand " that could lead to one or two positive outcomes , " he continued .
" it could tell us that the well is withholding the pressure and we can shut it or just cap it , if you will .
either way those are two pretty good outcomes . "
the latest in a series of attempts to contain the spill comes 13 weeks after the deepwater horizon explosion that triggered the worst environmental disaster in american history .
thus far response efforts have been patchy , with energy giant bp managing little more than a partial mop-up .
the us government estimates that some 60,000 barrels of oil are flowing out of the ruptured pipe every day .
of that , less than half is currently being captured .
by july 10 , only 749,000 barrels had been collected or burned off by containment systems .
' planned and practised ' the latest operation entails the removal of the ineffective existing cap and its replacement with something called a transition spool .
once that has been bolted onto the pipe , a huge oil-collecting funnel , dubbed the " top hat 10 " can be put in place to start capturing oil .
bildunterschrift : damage done off the coast of louisiana kent wells , bp 's vice president , told reporters he was optimistic they 'd got it right this time .
" we are pleased with our progress , " he said .
" we have carefully planned and practised this whole procedure .
we 've tried to work out as many of the bugs as we can . "
in addition to the new system , which should give the first reliable indication of the overall flow , a new containment ship has been deployed to the area . bp is confident that the combination of the two will stop the previously unstoppable .
the vessel , called the helix producer , was originally due to be on its way by sunday , but was delayed until monday for technical reasons .
temporary measure in conjunction with the new cap , the helix producer ought to raise capture capacity from a current 25,000 barrels a day to as much as 80,000 barrels a day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the supertankers have not cleared up as much as necessary white house spokesman robert gibbs told nbc that efforts to stem the flow of crude had reached a critical stage .
" the new containment procedure will more than triple our capacity , " he said .
but even if it does prove successful , it is still only a temporary measure .
a long-term solution is not expected until the middle of august , when drilling of the first of two relief wells is expected to be finished .
that work was suspended on saturday in order for the robots to remove the old cap , but in a statement released on saturday , bp said the time frame was realistic .
" although uncertainty still exists , the first half of august remains the current estimate of the most likely date by which the first relief well will be completed and kill operations performed , " bp said .
picking up the tab bp says that while it is too early to put a number on the overall cost of the disaster , it has so far cost the cash-rich company a massive 2.78 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
that includes the cost of containment , relief well drilling , grants to the gulf states , federal costs and claims paid .
bildunterschrift : livelihoods have been crushed by the oil contamination on saturday , the british energy giant said it had received 105,000 claims and had made more than 52,000 payments thus far .
but with so much still outstanding , speculation about bp 's next move is rife .
british and us newspapers reported on monday that the beleaguered oil company was in talks to sell 9.5 billion euros of assets in order to create a more substantial disaster fund .
there is also much talk about bp becoming the target of a hostile takeover bid from us rival , exxon .
neither company has commented on the reports , but the mere possibility helped push share prices up by 6 percent in london on monday .
meanwhile , the obama administration has announced that it is imposing a new moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling , citing new evidence of safety concerns following the deepwater horizion oil spill in the gulf of mexico .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .
purchased at the same auction , the gallery actually paid more for the inferior imitation than for the genuine botticelli . author : dany mitzman -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .
that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .
' fortress europe ' according to the eu 's employment commissioner , laszlo anders , immigrants have tended to be disproportionately over-represented in certain industries , like construction , making them especially vulnerable in the economic downturn .
" it 's important to get rid of stereotypes and fight the assumptions which are not really supported by evidence , " he said .
" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

on tuesday , labor minister eric woerth presented the bill to the cabinet and then delivered it to the national assembly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.07.2010 paul the octopus retires , but a future in spain beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oracle paul has become famous paul the octopus was an uncanny judge of germany 's world cup fortunes .
now , he can relax and retire in his aquarium in oberhausen , in northern germany .
a village in spain , however , would like to give him a new home . for weeks during the world cup , long lines formed in front of the sea life aquarium in oberhausen despite the summer heat , with people waiting patiently to enter the park .
an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .
and paul is an attraction .
paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .
two years ago , during the european football championship , paul gave the first samples of his abilities as an oracle .
how does he do it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul correctly picked the winner of all of germany 's matches paul loves mussels . during the 2008 tournament , someone came up with the idea to take two glass containers , drape each with the flag of one of the competing teams , and place a mussel inside .
enter paul the octopus , who would hover over the boxes , choose one of the mussels and fish it out - thus predicting which team would win that particular match .
sounds easy , but it is n't .
the aquarium followed the same procedure this year during the world cup , and paul was right every time . people wondered how he did it , and turned to scientists .
as it turns out , there are plenty of answers , not all of them scientific .
favorite color or sense of smell ?
one explanation : the color combination .
maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .
but even in this case , the prediction 's concurrence with the actual outcome of the match leaves too much room for coincidence .
bildunterschrift : many a german wished this fate on paul bodyguards for an octopus be that as it may , paul has gained worldwide fame . and like every other star , he does n't only have fans .
threats from disappointed german and dutch soccer fans can be found on the internet under " octopus paul , we know where your tank is . "
the internet was swamped by octopus recipes and pictures of octopuses hung out to dry .
a video on youtube showed brutal scenes from chinese restaurants , where live octopuses were tossed into a boiling liquid .
but none of that really matters to cuddly paul in his oberhausen aquarium .
sea life arranged for 24 hour ' security ' for the animal , successfully fending off any cowardly attacks .
retired octopus now that the world cup is over , the hoopla has died down somewhat .
which is a good thing .
after all , paul is two-and-a-half years old , a respectable age for an octopus .
he needs his rest .
as a matter of fact , paul might not be around much longer . while sea life wants to make sure he is content until he dies , paul 's fans do n't want him to retire .
the aquarium receives hundreds of emails every day with oracle questions for the mollusk .
questions like : " how long will merkel 's coalition last ? " or " am i going to get a d in math this year ? " are fun , but paul , according to scientific expertise , ca n't answer them .
so , in the end , the soothsaying octopus can peacefully swim through his tank toward that eternal resting place under water .
spain misses out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paella is not to be the famous oracle 's fate after all a generous offer from spain is not likely to change his fate .
a village in the northwestern part of the country has collected money and would like to buy paul for 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,720 -rrb- .
they want him to perform , though not as an oracle but as a mascot for a food festival with plenty of octopus specialties on the menu . evil be to him who evil thinks ...
but sea life in oberhausen wo n't be swayed by the tempting offer .
oberhausen is where paul will stay , where it 's clear this octopus is not going to end up in a paella .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 13.07.2010 homeopathy draws ire of german government officials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauterbach says there is no scientific evidence to support homeopathy the 200-year-old dubious medical treatment may soon be dropped from german medical insurance providers as a cost-saving measure .
the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice . " so health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine . homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the united kingdom , where the british medical association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the national health service should fund its use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in meissen , saxony scarce scientific evidence for practice nearly all medical officials agree with lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment . " if everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said dr. kay brune , a professor in the department of experimental and clinical pharmacology and toxicology at friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nuernberg , in southern germany . brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the german psyche . " homeopathy has a very long tradition in germany , " he added in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the founder , hahnemann was a brilliant physician .
but at that time doing nothing was helpful to the patient .
in 200 years , the pseudo-science has not taken any steps forward . " he also added that under the third reich , nazi medical officials explored it as a " non-jewish medicine , " and even they gave up on it . other german politicians have since jumped on the bandwagon , including rainer hess of the federal joint committee for doctors and insurers who described the current situation concerning homeopathy as " extremely unsatisfactory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the evidence , many germans still engage in homeopathic practices homeopathy costs are a drop in the bucket brune also said that even if politicians do manage to get rid of it from public insurance , they may be wasting their time because relatively little money is actually spent on homeopathy on an annual basis . " my estimate is 100 million euros -lsb- are spent on homeopathy annually -rsb- , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in germany , " he said . according to germany 's pharmaceutical industry federation -lrb- bpi -rrb- , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros german public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually . in the end though , brune added that because so many germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it . according to a recent study by the allensbach institute , a public opinion research firm in southern germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .
" they will make a compromise and under certain circumstances they will pay for it as they do for acupuncture .
it satisfies the health need at the lowest possible cost . " author : cyrus farivar editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the president 's first state visit to germany 's eastern neighbor . on his first visit to poland as germany 's new president on tuesday , christian wulff met with president-elect bronislaw komorowski and pledged to strengthen polish-german relations . both the new german president and his polish counterpart-to-be spoke about the coincidence that made both of them start their term in office at more or less the same time . wulff was elected on june 30 following the resignation of former president horst koehler in may . komorowski replaces the late president lech kaczynski , who along with his wife and 94 passengers was killed in an air crash in russia in april . the men took the opportunity of their first meeting to look ahead to a new level of cooperation between the two countries . komorowski spoke of the idea of patronage to be extended by both leaders over initiatives aimed at building rapprochement between the two nations . " we attach special attention to youth exchange schemes , " said komorowski .
he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .
the public supports the president-elect 's moves to improve relations with the poland 's closest neighbors , including germany . the specter of german domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff also met with polish prime minister donald tusk observers note that the visit by the new german president coincides with events marking the 600th anniversary of the battle of grunwald , in which polish and lithuanian troops defeated the teutonic knights , a german order of crusaders who made incursions against their neighbours .
this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "
opinion polls reveal that some of the polish electorate is still responsive to xenophobic rhetoric .
the situation is further complicated by the recent presidential campaign , in which the late president 's patriotic agenda and his attachment to history were exploited by his twin brother .
as poland 's two liberal leaders , komorowski and prime minister donald tusk , set out to build new bridges , internal polish politics are still likely to cast a shadow over polish-german relations .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .

it wants to devolve power to national governments , but it seems to have upset both gm proponents and detractors alike . in an unprecedented step to hand european union powers back to member states , the bloc 's executive - the european commission - has drafted plans to give countries the freedom to decide for themselves whether to grow or ban genetically modified crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european health commissioner john dalli says the executive is neutral the move is the result of frustration over years of deadlock over introducing the technology into the eu . the proposal would enable member states to prohibit the cultivation of gm crops that have already been scientifically approved , using economic , social and ethical reasons as the justification for the bans . countries would have the power to prohibit cultivating the crops on all or part of their territories . under the current system , gm crop applications are examined by a panel of experts from eu states and need to pass with a qualified majority .
in the case of a deadlock , the decision goes to eu ministers and if an impasse persists , the european commission is left with the final decision . to date , only two varieties of gm crops have been approved in the bloc , compared to around 150 world-wide . more legal disputes ? opponents of genetically modified food are worried that biotech companies will take advantage of the new proposal to force more of their products into the union . " any country wanting to ban gm crops under these proposals will open themselves up to legal challenges from the biotech corporations who want to force gm crops into europe , " said mute schimpf , food campaigner for environmental group friends of the earth europe . the uk-based organization gm freeze warned that members of the eu opposed to gm crops could be exposed to fresh trade complaints , which would be difficult to defend against . " member states should approach the commission 's proposals claiming to facilitate bans on gm crops with extreme caution , " said pete riley , campaigns director at gm freeze . " they need to ensure that in the short and long term that they will be able to ban a gm crop without ending up in court or with a wto dispute . " riley said he was n't categorically opposed to the proposal . allowing member states the right to make the final decision on gm crops is " the right thing to do , " he said , but he is concerned that what is on the table " appears to be subject to last minute changes . " biotech disappointment however , far from celebrating a business opportunity , some biotech proponents are expressing concerns about the prospects of more – not fewer – legal battles in future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in early 2010 , the eu authorized the cultivation of the genetically modified amflora potato " our fear is that it -lrb- the proposal -rrb- will be misused by governments to ban products indiscriminately , " carel du marchie sarvaas - from the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- - told deutsche welle . " we are science-based people , so when we hear politicians say that it 's ok to ban something for political reasons , we find that hard to live with . " " you 're going to have different rules in different eu countries , " said julian little , spokesman for german biotech firm bayer cropscience . " it 's just inviting legal disputes , and the lawyers are going to love it . " farming perspective farmers are also unimpressed . copa-cogeca - an organization representing farmers and agricultural cooperatives in the eu - is worried that differing rules between european countries would jeopardize the eu 's internal market and distort competition between the bloc 's farmers . " this will result in new legal and commercial risks , which farmers can not cover themselves , " said copa-cogeca secretary-general pekka pesonen . " we also urge the commission to make sure that the independent eu food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- risk assessment process remains the basis of the gm authorization system , " added pesonen . however , the european commission appears determined to push through with its plans , and is no stranger to hostility on the issue - having defended the bloc 's current policy in global trade disputes while facing pressure at home for approving gm products in the first place . the new proposals have been designed to try and minimize the chances for governments or the european parliament to block or change them . author : eva wutke -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .

the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .

many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .

" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .

construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .

president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .

india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.07.2010 bp claims ' significant progress ' in battle to cap oil well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp confirms a well cap is in place to stem flow of oil from ruptured pipeline thirteen weeks after the oil catastrophe in the gulf of mexico , bp says it has successfully installed a cap to stop of the flow of oil into the sea .
tests on tuesday will determine if the oil spill has been stopped . " we have made significant progress .
this could lead to the shutting of the well , " admiral thad allen , head of the us government response effort , told the nbc television network on monday .
he was referring to the latest attempt to halt the massive oil slick in the gulf of mexico - which is still spewing vast amounts of crude into the ocean every day - by using underwater robots to install a new cap over the ruptured well .
" this containment cap will have the ability to actually close down valves and slowly contain all the oil , " allen said in another interview with news network cnn .
he said it will be possible to see how much pressure is in the well which will help determine whether or not its possible to shut the well for a period of time " , allen said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admiral thad allen , head of response effort , says progress is at hand " that could lead to one or two positive outcomes , " he continued .
" it could tell us that the well is withholding the pressure and we can shut it or just cap it , if you will .
either way those are two pretty good outcomes . "
the latest in a series of attempts to contain the spill comes 13 weeks after the deepwater horizon explosion that triggered the worst environmental disaster in american history .
thus far response efforts have been patchy , with energy giant bp managing little more than a partial mop-up .
the us government estimates that some 60,000 barrels of oil are flowing out of the ruptured pipe every day .
of that , less than half is currently being captured .
by july 10 , only 749,000 barrels had been collected or burned off by containment systems .
' planned and practised ' the latest operation entails the removal of the ineffective existing cap and its replacement with something called a transition spool .
once that has been bolted onto the pipe , a huge oil-collecting funnel , dubbed the " top hat 10 " can be put in place to start capturing oil .
bildunterschrift : damage done off the coast of louisiana kent wells , bp 's vice president , told reporters he was optimistic they 'd got it right this time .
" we are pleased with our progress , " he said .
" we have carefully planned and practised this whole procedure .
we 've tried to work out as many of the bugs as we can . "
in addition to the new system , which should give the first reliable indication of the overall flow , a new containment ship has been deployed to the area . bp is confident that the combination of the two will stop the previously unstoppable .
the vessel , called the helix producer , was originally due to be on its way by sunday , but was delayed until monday for technical reasons .
temporary measure in conjunction with the new cap , the helix producer ought to raise capture capacity from a current 25,000 barrels a day to as much as 80,000 barrels a day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the supertankers have not cleared up as much as necessary white house spokesman robert gibbs told nbc that efforts to stem the flow of crude had reached a critical stage .
" the new containment procedure will more than triple our capacity , " he said .
but even if it does prove successful , it is still only a temporary measure .
a long-term solution is not expected until the middle of august , when drilling of the first of two relief wells is expected to be finished .
that work was suspended on saturday in order for the robots to remove the old cap , but in a statement released on saturday , bp said the time frame was realistic .
" although uncertainty still exists , the first half of august remains the current estimate of the most likely date by which the first relief well will be completed and kill operations performed , " bp said .
picking up the tab bp says that while it is too early to put a number on the overall cost of the disaster , it has so far cost the cash-rich company a massive 2.78 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
that includes the cost of containment , relief well drilling , grants to the gulf states , federal costs and claims paid .
bildunterschrift : livelihoods have been crushed by the oil contamination on saturday , the british energy giant said it had received 105,000 claims and had made more than 52,000 payments thus far .
but with so much still outstanding , speculation about bp 's next move is rife .
british and us newspapers reported on monday that the beleaguered oil company was in talks to sell 9.5 billion euros of assets in order to create a more substantial disaster fund .
there is also much talk about bp becoming the target of a hostile takeover bid from us rival , exxon .
neither company has commented on the reports , but the mere possibility helped push share prices up by 6 percent in london on monday .
meanwhile , the obama administration has announced that it is imposing a new moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling , citing new evidence of safety concerns following the deepwater horizion oil spill in the gulf of mexico .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .

it said it expected portugal 's debt troubles to continue for the next two to three years and called on the government to enact further austerity measures in the 2011 budget .
the euro dropped to a one-week low of $ 1.2533 .

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .
that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .
' fortress europe ' according to the eu 's employment commissioner , laszlo anders , immigrants have tended to be disproportionately over-represented in certain industries , like construction , making them especially vulnerable in the economic downturn .
" it 's important to get rid of stereotypes and fight the assumptions which are not really supported by evidence , " he said .
" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .
it also notes that in some countries there has been an increase in employment rates among immigrant women , who took up extra work after their husbands lost their jobs .
migrants in germany to be promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's malmstom says the 27-nation block needs a long-term migration policy faced with a sharp drop in the number of skilled workers in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's government and the federal labor agency have proposed ways of promoting migrants ' qualifications .
statistics show that the qualifications levels among young people with migration backgrounds are far too low . maria boehmer , the government official responsible for migration , says that too many foreigners are currently employed in jobs below their qualifications .
the cdu politician has announced that she would be proposing draft legislation by the end of the year that would speed up and simplify recognition of foreign academic qualifications . the opposition green party has urged the center-right governing coalition to make it easier for foreigners living in germany to obtain german citizenship . it argues that citizenship tests should be abolished and that it should be generally possible for people becoming germans to retain their original citizenship .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .

before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .
purchased at the same auction , the gallery actually paid more for the inferior imitation than for the genuine botticelli . author : dany mitzman -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un command said in a statement the north 's army representatives requested a delay " for administrative reasons " .
no new time has been set .
a joint team of investigators involving military officers and civilian experts from the south , the united states and sweden in may accused the north of launching a torpedo attack on the south korean warship cheonan , killing 46 sailors .
military officers from north korea and the un command that oversees the korean war truce were to meet at the korean border of panmunjom to discuss the sinking of the ship .
it would have been the first meeting since the sinking on march 26 , which sharply raised tension on the divided korean peninsula .
bildunterschrift : the talks were supposed to take place in the border village of panmunjom diplomatic tussles the north denies it was involved in the sinking and has accused the south of masterminding a fabrication for political gain .
on friday , the un security council in a statement condemned the attack but did not directly blame the north , apparently in a concession to china , a permanent member and north korea 's only ally .
north korea celebrated the statement as a diplomatic victory .
" problems on the korean peninsula can only be resolved through the peaceful methods of talks and negotiation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesperson qin gang told a regular news briefing in beijing on tuesday .
" a war of words , or even using military means , can not fundamentally resolve the issues " .
the two allies us and south korea have planned a naval exercise as a show of strength following the attack in march .
the location has not been decided .
it was originally planned for the yellow sea , but this caused strong protests from china .
observers have pointed out that north korea 's decision to put off the cheonan talks could be related to its dismay about the war games. jb / reuters / afp / ap editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there were 335 votes for the bill and just one against .
" passing this bill against concealing your face is a success on two fronts , " france 's justice minister michele alliot-marie said on tuesday .
" first of all , it 's a great success for democracy , which has been strengthened by a good quality debate in parliament .
secondly , it 's a success for the french republic and the values it stands for , " she added .
while center-right parties like president nicholas sarkozy 's ump party and the nouveau centre party voted for the bill , most members of the opposition socialist , communist and green parties refused to take part , because they fear it may go against the constitution .
controversial bill with five million muslims , france is home to europe 's largest muslim community .
if the bill is signed into law , wearing the burqa or the niqab will incur a fine of 150 euros -lrb- $ 189 -rrb- .
the main body representing muslims in france , the french council of the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- , has deplored the ban insisting that it stigmatizes the whole of islam , when only about 2,000 women actually wear such a veil .
the law must still be approved by france 's upper house , the senate , in september .
it will then have to go to france 's constitutional council for a review .
france is the second european country to move towards a ban of full-face veils after belgium 's lower house of parliament voted in april to ban all clothing that covers or partially covers the face .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.07.2010 bp claims ' significant progress ' in battle to cap oil well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp confirms a well cap is in place to stem flow of oil from ruptured pipeline thirteen weeks after the oil catastrophe in the gulf of mexico , bp says it has successfully installed a cap to stop of the flow of oil into the sea .
tests on tuesday will determine if the oil spill has been stopped . " we have made significant progress .
this could lead to the shutting of the well , " admiral thad allen , head of the us government response effort , told the nbc television network on monday .
he was referring to the latest attempt to halt the massive oil slick in the gulf of mexico - which is still spewing vast amounts of crude into the ocean every day - by using underwater robots to install a new cap over the ruptured well .
" this containment cap will have the ability to actually close down valves and slowly contain all the oil , " allen said in another interview with news network cnn .
he said it will be possible to see how much pressure is in the well which will help determine whether or not its possible to shut the well for a period of time " , allen said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admiral thad allen , head of response effort , says progress is at hand " that could lead to one or two positive outcomes , " he continued .
" it could tell us that the well is withholding the pressure and we can shut it or just cap it , if you will .
either way those are two pretty good outcomes . "
the latest in a series of attempts to contain the spill comes 13 weeks after the deepwater horizon explosion that triggered the worst environmental disaster in american history .
thus far response efforts have been patchy , with energy giant bp managing little more than a partial mop-up .
the us government estimates that some 60,000 barrels of oil are flowing out of the ruptured pipe every day .
of that , less than half is currently being captured .
by july 10 , only 749,000 barrels had been collected or burned off by containment systems .
' planned and practised ' the latest operation entails the removal of the ineffective existing cap and its replacement with something called a transition spool .
once that has been bolted onto the pipe , a huge oil-collecting funnel , dubbed the " top hat 10 " can be put in place to start capturing oil .
bildunterschrift : damage done off the coast of louisiana kent wells , bp 's vice president , told reporters he was optimistic they 'd got it right this time .
" we are pleased with our progress , " he said .
" we have carefully planned and practised this whole procedure .
we 've tried to work out as many of the bugs as we can . "
in addition to the new system , which should give the first reliable indication of the overall flow , a new containment ship has been deployed to the area . bp is confident that the combination of the two will stop the previously unstoppable .
the vessel , called the helix producer , was originally due to be on its way by sunday , but was delayed until monday for technical reasons .
temporary measure in conjunction with the new cap , the helix producer ought to raise capture capacity from a current 25,000 barrels a day to as much as 80,000 barrels a day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the supertankers have not cleared up as much as necessary white house spokesman robert gibbs told nbc that efforts to stem the flow of crude had reached a critical stage .
" the new containment procedure will more than triple our capacity , " he said .
but even if it does prove successful , it is still only a temporary measure .
a long-term solution is not expected until the middle of august , when drilling of the first of two relief wells is expected to be finished .
that work was suspended on saturday in order for the robots to remove the old cap , but in a statement released on saturday , bp said the time frame was realistic .
" although uncertainty still exists , the first half of august remains the current estimate of the most likely date by which the first relief well will be completed and kill operations performed , " bp said .
picking up the tab bp says that while it is too early to put a number on the overall cost of the disaster , it has so far cost the cash-rich company a massive 2.78 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
that includes the cost of containment , relief well drilling , grants to the gulf states , federal costs and claims paid .
bildunterschrift : livelihoods have been crushed by the oil contamination on saturday , the british energy giant said it had received 105,000 claims and had made more than 52,000 payments thus far .
but with so much still outstanding , speculation about bp 's next move is rife .
british and us newspapers reported on monday that the beleaguered oil company was in talks to sell 9.5 billion euros of assets in order to create a more substantial disaster fund .
there is also much talk about bp becoming the target of a hostile takeover bid from us rival , exxon .
neither company has commented on the reports , but the mere possibility helped push share prices up by 6 percent in london on monday .
meanwhile , the obama administration has announced that it is imposing a new moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling , citing new evidence of safety concerns following the deepwater horizion oil spill in the gulf of mexico .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 13.07.2010 london 's national gallery exposes the art of counterfeit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this piece is painted on a panel that is dated after the alleged artist 's death a painting may look like that of an old master , but how do museums know the work is genuine ?
an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .
purchased at the same auction , the gallery actually paid more for the inferior imitation than for the genuine botticelli . author : dany mitzman -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

it was the president 's first state visit to germany 's eastern neighbor . on his first visit to poland as germany 's new president on tuesday , christian wulff met with president-elect bronislaw komorowski and pledged to strengthen polish-german relations . both the new german president and his polish counterpart-to-be spoke about the coincidence that made both of them start their term in office at more or less the same time . wulff was elected on june 30 following the resignation of former president horst koehler in may . komorowski replaces the late president lech kaczynski , who along with his wife and 94 passengers was killed in an air crash in russia in april . the men took the opportunity of their first meeting to look ahead to a new level of cooperation between the two countries . komorowski spoke of the idea of patronage to be extended by both leaders over initiatives aimed at building rapprochement between the two nations . " we attach special attention to youth exchange schemes , " said komorowski .
he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .
the public supports the president-elect 's moves to improve relations with the poland 's closest neighbors , including germany . the specter of german domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff also met with polish prime minister donald tusk observers note that the visit by the new german president coincides with events marking the 600th anniversary of the battle of grunwald , in which polish and lithuanian troops defeated the teutonic knights , a german order of crusaders who made incursions against their neighbours .
this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "
opinion polls reveal that some of the polish electorate is still responsive to xenophobic rhetoric .
the situation is further complicated by the recent presidential campaign , in which the late president 's patriotic agenda and his attachment to history were exploited by his twin brother .
as poland 's two liberal leaders , komorowski and prime minister donald tusk , set out to build new bridges , internal polish politics are still likely to cast a shadow over polish-german relations .

it wants to devolve power to national governments , but it seems to have upset both gm proponents and detractors alike . in an unprecedented step to hand european union powers back to member states , the bloc 's executive - the european commission - has drafted plans to give countries the freedom to decide for themselves whether to grow or ban genetically modified crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european health commissioner john dalli says the executive is neutral the move is the result of frustration over years of deadlock over introducing the technology into the eu . the proposal would enable member states to prohibit the cultivation of gm crops that have already been scientifically approved , using economic , social and ethical reasons as the justification for the bans . countries would have the power to prohibit cultivating the crops on all or part of their territories . under the current system , gm crop applications are examined by a panel of experts from eu states and need to pass with a qualified majority .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.07.2010 paul the octopus retires , but a future in spain beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oracle paul has become famous paul the octopus was an uncanny judge of germany 's world cup fortunes .
now , he can relax and retire in his aquarium in oberhausen , in northern germany .
a village in spain , however , would like to give him a new home . for weeks during the world cup , long lines formed in front of the sea life aquarium in oberhausen despite the summer heat , with people waiting patiently to enter the park .
an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .
and paul is an attraction .
paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .
two years ago , during the european football championship , paul gave the first samples of his abilities as an oracle .
how does he do it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul correctly picked the winner of all of germany 's matches paul loves mussels . during the 2008 tournament , someone came up with the idea to take two glass containers , drape each with the flag of one of the competing teams , and place a mussel inside .
enter paul the octopus , who would hover over the boxes , choose one of the mussels and fish it out - thus predicting which team would win that particular match .
sounds easy , but it is n't .
the aquarium followed the same procedure this year during the world cup , and paul was right every time . people wondered how he did it , and turned to scientists .
as it turns out , there are plenty of answers , not all of them scientific .
favorite color or sense of smell ?
one explanation : the color combination .
maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .
but even in this case , the prediction 's concurrence with the actual outcome of the match leaves too much room for coincidence .
bildunterschrift : many a german wished this fate on paul bodyguards for an octopus be that as it may , paul has gained worldwide fame . and like every other star , he does n't only have fans .
threats from disappointed german and dutch soccer fans can be found on the internet under " octopus paul , we know where your tank is . "
the internet was swamped by octopus recipes and pictures of octopuses hung out to dry .
a video on youtube showed brutal scenes from chinese restaurants , where live octopuses were tossed into a boiling liquid .
but none of that really matters to cuddly paul in his oberhausen aquarium .
sea life arranged for 24 hour ' security ' for the animal , successfully fending off any cowardly attacks .
retired octopus now that the world cup is over , the hoopla has died down somewhat .
which is a good thing .
after all , paul is two-and-a-half years old , a respectable age for an octopus .
he needs his rest .
as a matter of fact , paul might not be around much longer . while sea life wants to make sure he is content until he dies , paul 's fans do n't want him to retire .
the aquarium receives hundreds of emails every day with oracle questions for the mollusk .
questions like : " how long will merkel 's coalition last ? " or " am i going to get a d in math this year ? " are fun , but paul , according to scientific expertise , ca n't answer them .
so , in the end , the soothsaying octopus can peacefully swim through his tank toward that eternal resting place under water .
spain misses out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paella is not to be the famous oracle 's fate after all a generous offer from spain is not likely to change his fate .
a village in the northwestern part of the country has collected money and would like to buy paul for 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,720 -rrb- .
they want him to perform , though not as an oracle but as a mascot for a food festival with plenty of octopus specialties on the menu . evil be to him who evil thinks ...
but sea life in oberhausen wo n't be swayed by the tempting offer .
oberhausen is where paul will stay , where it 's clear this octopus is not going to end up in a paella .

now , he can relax and retire in his aquarium in oberhausen , in northern germany .
a village in spain , however , would like to give him a new home . for weeks during the world cup , long lines formed in front of the sea life aquarium in oberhausen despite the summer heat , with people waiting patiently to enter the park .
an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .
and paul is an attraction .
paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .
two years ago , during the european football championship , paul gave the first samples of his abilities as an oracle .
how does he do it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul correctly picked the winner of all of germany 's matches paul loves mussels . during the 2008 tournament , someone came up with the idea to take two glass containers , drape each with the flag of one of the competing teams , and place a mussel inside .
enter paul the octopus , who would hover over the boxes , choose one of the mussels and fish it out - thus predicting which team would win that particular match .
sounds easy , but it is n't .
the aquarium followed the same procedure this year during the world cup , and paul was right every time . people wondered how he did it , and turned to scientists .
as it turns out , there are plenty of answers , not all of them scientific .
favorite color or sense of smell ?
one explanation : the color combination .
maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .
but even in this case , the prediction 's concurrence with the actual outcome of the match leaves too much room for coincidence .
bildunterschrift : many a german wished this fate on paul bodyguards for an octopus be that as it may , paul has gained worldwide fame . and like every other star , he does n't only have fans .
threats from disappointed german and dutch soccer fans can be found on the internet under " octopus paul , we know where your tank is . "
the internet was swamped by octopus recipes and pictures of octopuses hung out to dry .
a video on youtube showed brutal scenes from chinese restaurants , where live octopuses were tossed into a boiling liquid .
but none of that really matters to cuddly paul in his oberhausen aquarium .
sea life arranged for 24 hour ' security ' for the animal , successfully fending off any cowardly attacks .
retired octopus now that the world cup is over , the hoopla has died down somewhat .
which is a good thing .
after all , paul is two-and-a-half years old , a respectable age for an octopus .
he needs his rest .
as a matter of fact , paul might not be around much longer . while sea life wants to make sure he is content until he dies , paul 's fans do n't want him to retire .
the aquarium receives hundreds of emails every day with oracle questions for the mollusk .
questions like : " how long will merkel 's coalition last ? " or " am i going to get a d in math this year ? " are fun , but paul , according to scientific expertise , ca n't answer them .
so , in the end , the soothsaying octopus can peacefully swim through his tank toward that eternal resting place under water .
spain misses out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paella is not to be the famous oracle 's fate after all a generous offer from spain is not likely to change his fate .
a village in the northwestern part of the country has collected money and would like to buy paul for 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,720 -rrb- .
they want him to perform , though not as an oracle but as a mascot for a food festival with plenty of octopus specialties on the menu . evil be to him who evil thinks ...

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice . " so health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine . homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the united kingdom , where the british medical association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the national health service should fund its use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in meissen , saxony scarce scientific evidence for practice nearly all medical officials agree with lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment . " if everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said dr. kay brune , a professor in the department of experimental and clinical pharmacology and toxicology at friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nuernberg , in southern germany . brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the german psyche . " homeopathy has a very long tradition in germany , " he added in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the founder , hahnemann was a brilliant physician .
but at that time doing nothing was helpful to the patient .
in 200 years , the pseudo-science has not taken any steps forward . " he also added that under the third reich , nazi medical officials explored it as a " non-jewish medicine , " and even they gave up on it . other german politicians have since jumped on the bandwagon , including rainer hess of the federal joint committee for doctors and insurers who described the current situation concerning homeopathy as " extremely unsatisfactory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the evidence , many germans still engage in homeopathic practices homeopathy costs are a drop in the bucket brune also said that even if politicians do manage to get rid of it from public insurance , they may be wasting their time because relatively little money is actually spent on homeopathy on an annual basis . " my estimate is 100 million euros -lsb- are spent on homeopathy annually -rsb- , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in germany , " he said . according to germany 's pharmaceutical industry federation -lrb- bpi -rrb- , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros german public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually . in the end though , brune added that because so many germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it . according to a recent study by the allensbach institute , a public opinion research firm in southern germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .
" they will make a compromise and under certain circumstances they will pay for it as they do for acupuncture .
it satisfies the health need at the lowest possible cost . " author : cyrus farivar editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .
purchased at the same auction , the gallery actually paid more for the inferior imitation than for the genuine botticelli . author : dany mitzman -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .

it was the president 's first state visit to germany 's eastern neighbor . on his first visit to poland as germany 's new president on tuesday , christian wulff met with president-elect bronislaw komorowski and pledged to strengthen polish-german relations . both the new german president and his polish counterpart-to-be spoke about the coincidence that made both of them start their term in office at more or less the same time . wulff was elected on june 30 following the resignation of former president horst koehler in may . komorowski replaces the late president lech kaczynski , who along with his wife and 94 passengers was killed in an air crash in russia in april . the men took the opportunity of their first meeting to look ahead to a new level of cooperation between the two countries . komorowski spoke of the idea of patronage to be extended by both leaders over initiatives aimed at building rapprochement between the two nations . " we attach special attention to youth exchange schemes , " said komorowski .
he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .

this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "
opinion polls reveal that some of the polish electorate is still responsive to xenophobic rhetoric .
the situation is further complicated by the recent presidential campaign , in which the late president 's patriotic agenda and his attachment to history were exploited by his twin brother .
as poland 's two liberal leaders , komorowski and prime minister donald tusk , set out to build new bridges , internal polish politics are still likely to cast a shadow over polish-german relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.07.2010 bp claims ' significant progress ' in battle to cap oil well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp confirms a well cap is in place to stem flow of oil from ruptured pipeline thirteen weeks after the oil catastrophe in the gulf of mexico , bp says it has successfully installed a cap to stop of the flow of oil into the sea .
tests on tuesday will determine if the oil spill has been stopped . " we have made significant progress .
this could lead to the shutting of the well , " admiral thad allen , head of the us government response effort , told the nbc television network on monday .
he was referring to the latest attempt to halt the massive oil slick in the gulf of mexico - which is still spewing vast amounts of crude into the ocean every day - by using underwater robots to install a new cap over the ruptured well .
" this containment cap will have the ability to actually close down valves and slowly contain all the oil , " allen said in another interview with news network cnn .
he said it will be possible to see how much pressure is in the well which will help determine whether or not its possible to shut the well for a period of time " , allen said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admiral thad allen , head of response effort , says progress is at hand " that could lead to one or two positive outcomes , " he continued .
" it could tell us that the well is withholding the pressure and we can shut it or just cap it , if you will .
either way those are two pretty good outcomes . "
the latest in a series of attempts to contain the spill comes 13 weeks after the deepwater horizon explosion that triggered the worst environmental disaster in american history .
thus far response efforts have been patchy , with energy giant bp managing little more than a partial mop-up .
the us government estimates that some 60,000 barrels of oil are flowing out of the ruptured pipe every day .
of that , less than half is currently being captured .
by july 10 , only 749,000 barrels had been collected or burned off by containment systems .
' planned and practised ' the latest operation entails the removal of the ineffective existing cap and its replacement with something called a transition spool .
once that has been bolted onto the pipe , a huge oil-collecting funnel , dubbed the " top hat 10 " can be put in place to start capturing oil .
bildunterschrift : damage done off the coast of louisiana kent wells , bp 's vice president , told reporters he was optimistic they 'd got it right this time .
" we are pleased with our progress , " he said .
" we have carefully planned and practised this whole procedure .
we 've tried to work out as many of the bugs as we can . "
in addition to the new system , which should give the first reliable indication of the overall flow , a new containment ship has been deployed to the area . bp is confident that the combination of the two will stop the previously unstoppable .
the vessel , called the helix producer , was originally due to be on its way by sunday , but was delayed until monday for technical reasons .
temporary measure in conjunction with the new cap , the helix producer ought to raise capture capacity from a current 25,000 barrels a day to as much as 80,000 barrels a day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the supertankers have not cleared up as much as necessary white house spokesman robert gibbs told nbc that efforts to stem the flow of crude had reached a critical stage .
" the new containment procedure will more than triple our capacity , " he said .
but even if it does prove successful , it is still only a temporary measure .
a long-term solution is not expected until the middle of august , when drilling of the first of two relief wells is expected to be finished .
that work was suspended on saturday in order for the robots to remove the old cap , but in a statement released on saturday , bp said the time frame was realistic .
" although uncertainty still exists , the first half of august remains the current estimate of the most likely date by which the first relief well will be completed and kill operations performed , " bp said .
picking up the tab bp says that while it is too early to put a number on the overall cost of the disaster , it has so far cost the cash-rich company a massive 2.78 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
that includes the cost of containment , relief well drilling , grants to the gulf states , federal costs and claims paid .
bildunterschrift : livelihoods have been crushed by the oil contamination on saturday , the british energy giant said it had received 105,000 claims and had made more than 52,000 payments thus far .
but with so much still outstanding , speculation about bp 's next move is rife .
british and us newspapers reported on monday that the beleaguered oil company was in talks to sell 9.5 billion euros of assets in order to create a more substantial disaster fund .
there is also much talk about bp becoming the target of a hostile takeover bid from us rival , exxon .
neither company has commented on the reports , but the mere possibility helped push share prices up by 6 percent in london on monday .
meanwhile , the obama administration has announced that it is imposing a new moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling , citing new evidence of safety concerns following the deepwater horizion oil spill in the gulf of mexico .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.07.2010 bp claims ' significant progress ' in battle to cap oil well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp confirms a well cap is in place to stem flow of oil from ruptured pipeline thirteen weeks after the oil catastrophe in the gulf of mexico , bp says it has successfully installed a cap to stop of the flow of oil into the sea .
tests on tuesday will determine if the oil spill has been stopped . " we have made significant progress .
this could lead to the shutting of the well , " admiral thad allen , head of the us government response effort , told the nbc television network on monday .
he was referring to the latest attempt to halt the massive oil slick in the gulf of mexico - which is still spewing vast amounts of crude into the ocean every day - by using underwater robots to install a new cap over the ruptured well .
" this containment cap will have the ability to actually close down valves and slowly contain all the oil , " allen said in another interview with news network cnn .
he said it will be possible to see how much pressure is in the well which will help determine whether or not its possible to shut the well for a period of time " , allen said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admiral thad allen , head of response effort , says progress is at hand " that could lead to one or two positive outcomes , " he continued .
" it could tell us that the well is withholding the pressure and we can shut it or just cap it , if you will .
either way those are two pretty good outcomes . "
the latest in a series of attempts to contain the spill comes 13 weeks after the deepwater horizon explosion that triggered the worst environmental disaster in american history .
thus far response efforts have been patchy , with energy giant bp managing little more than a partial mop-up .
the us government estimates that some 60,000 barrels of oil are flowing out of the ruptured pipe every day .
of that , less than half is currently being captured .
by july 10 , only 749,000 barrels had been collected or burned off by containment systems .
' planned and practised ' the latest operation entails the removal of the ineffective existing cap and its replacement with something called a transition spool .
once that has been bolted onto the pipe , a huge oil-collecting funnel , dubbed the " top hat 10 " can be put in place to start capturing oil .
bildunterschrift : damage done off the coast of louisiana kent wells , bp 's vice president , told reporters he was optimistic they 'd got it right this time .
" we are pleased with our progress , " he said .
" we have carefully planned and practised this whole procedure .
we 've tried to work out as many of the bugs as we can . "
in addition to the new system , which should give the first reliable indication of the overall flow , a new containment ship has been deployed to the area . bp is confident that the combination of the two will stop the previously unstoppable .
the vessel , called the helix producer , was originally due to be on its way by sunday , but was delayed until monday for technical reasons .
temporary measure in conjunction with the new cap , the helix producer ought to raise capture capacity from a current 25,000 barrels a day to as much as 80,000 barrels a day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the supertankers have not cleared up as much as necessary white house spokesman robert gibbs told nbc that efforts to stem the flow of crude had reached a critical stage .
" the new containment procedure will more than triple our capacity , " he said .
but even if it does prove successful , it is still only a temporary measure .
a long-term solution is not expected until the middle of august , when drilling of the first of two relief wells is expected to be finished .
that work was suspended on saturday in order for the robots to remove the old cap , but in a statement released on saturday , bp said the time frame was realistic .
" although uncertainty still exists , the first half of august remains the current estimate of the most likely date by which the first relief well will be completed and kill operations performed , " bp said .
picking up the tab bp says that while it is too early to put a number on the overall cost of the disaster , it has so far cost the cash-rich company a massive 2.78 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
that includes the cost of containment , relief well drilling , grants to the gulf states , federal costs and claims paid .
bildunterschrift : livelihoods have been crushed by the oil contamination on saturday , the british energy giant said it had received 105,000 claims and had made more than 52,000 payments thus far .
but with so much still outstanding , speculation about bp 's next move is rife .
british and us newspapers reported on monday that the beleaguered oil company was in talks to sell 9.5 billion euros of assets in order to create a more substantial disaster fund .
there is also much talk about bp becoming the target of a hostile takeover bid from us rival , exxon .
neither company has commented on the reports , but the mere possibility helped push share prices up by 6 percent in london on monday .
meanwhile , the obama administration has announced that it is imposing a new moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling , citing new evidence of safety concerns following the deepwater horizion oil spill in the gulf of mexico .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .

according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .

the market reaction , however , was muted . moody 's investor service , the international ratings agency , lowered portugal 's sovereign debt rating on tuesday by two grades to a1 from aa2 .
the agency said the country 's growth is still weak and that its debt continues to climb .
it said it expected portugal 's debt troubles to continue for the next two to three years and called on the government to enact further austerity measures in the 2011 budget .
the euro dropped to a one-week low of $ 1.2533 .
the wider market reaction was muted , however , as moody 's is only playing catch-up with rival agency standard & poor 's , which still rates portuguese debt two notches lower at a- .
" it does n't have the same impact as it would if the likes of s & p were to downgrade , given the move only brings -lsb- moody 's -rsb- in line , " sean maloney , a rate strategist at nomura , told reuters news agency .
city index analyst joshua raymond agreed , telling the afp wire service , " i do not think this took a lot of investors by surprise this morning , which is why the market reaction for europe as a whole has not been too severe thus far . "
" what the cut does do , however , is reaffirm the fragility of credit ratings for those countries with high debts and any cut in credit ratings is likely to be seen as a vote of no confidence , " he added .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .
the local traders are looking for around 50-60 items to trade .
and also the traders want to visit each other .
they are looking for a kind of visa that will enable them to travel at least for a year without any restrictions . " both india and pakistan claim kashmir as a whole .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

tests on tuesday will determine if the oil spill has been stopped . " we have made significant progress .
this could lead to the shutting of the well , " admiral thad allen , head of the us government response effort , told the nbc television network on monday .
he was referring to the latest attempt to halt the massive oil slick in the gulf of mexico - which is still spewing vast amounts of crude into the ocean every day - by using underwater robots to install a new cap over the ruptured well .
" this containment cap will have the ability to actually close down valves and slowly contain all the oil , " allen said in another interview with news network cnn .
he said it will be possible to see how much pressure is in the well which will help determine whether or not its possible to shut the well for a period of time " , allen said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admiral thad allen , head of response effort , says progress is at hand " that could lead to one or two positive outcomes , " he continued .
" it could tell us that the well is withholding the pressure and we can shut it or just cap it , if you will .
either way those are two pretty good outcomes . "
the latest in a series of attempts to contain the spill comes 13 weeks after the deepwater horizon explosion that triggered the worst environmental disaster in american history .
thus far response efforts have been patchy , with energy giant bp managing little more than a partial mop-up .
the us government estimates that some 60,000 barrels of oil are flowing out of the ruptured pipe every day .
of that , less than half is currently being captured .
by july 10 , only 749,000 barrels had been collected or burned off by containment systems .
' planned and practised ' the latest operation entails the removal of the ineffective existing cap and its replacement with something called a transition spool .
once that has been bolted onto the pipe , a huge oil-collecting funnel , dubbed the " top hat 10 " can be put in place to start capturing oil .
bildunterschrift : damage done off the coast of louisiana kent wells , bp 's vice president , told reporters he was optimistic they 'd got it right this time .
" we are pleased with our progress , " he said .
" we have carefully planned and practised this whole procedure .
we 've tried to work out as many of the bugs as we can . "
in addition to the new system , which should give the first reliable indication of the overall flow , a new containment ship has been deployed to the area . bp is confident that the combination of the two will stop the previously unstoppable .
the vessel , called the helix producer , was originally due to be on its way by sunday , but was delayed until monday for technical reasons .
temporary measure in conjunction with the new cap , the helix producer ought to raise capture capacity from a current 25,000 barrels a day to as much as 80,000 barrels a day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the supertankers have not cleared up as much as necessary white house spokesman robert gibbs told nbc that efforts to stem the flow of crude had reached a critical stage .
" the new containment procedure will more than triple our capacity , " he said .
but even if it does prove successful , it is still only a temporary measure .
a long-term solution is not expected until the middle of august , when drilling of the first of two relief wells is expected to be finished .
that work was suspended on saturday in order for the robots to remove the old cap , but in a statement released on saturday , bp said the time frame was realistic .
" although uncertainty still exists , the first half of august remains the current estimate of the most likely date by which the first relief well will be completed and kill operations performed , " bp said .
picking up the tab bp says that while it is too early to put a number on the overall cost of the disaster , it has so far cost the cash-rich company a massive 2.78 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
that includes the cost of containment , relief well drilling , grants to the gulf states , federal costs and claims paid .
bildunterschrift : livelihoods have been crushed by the oil contamination on saturday , the british energy giant said it had received 105,000 claims and had made more than 52,000 payments thus far .
but with so much still outstanding , speculation about bp 's next move is rife .
british and us newspapers reported on monday that the beleaguered oil company was in talks to sell 9.5 billion euros of assets in order to create a more substantial disaster fund .
there is also much talk about bp becoming the target of a hostile takeover bid from us rival , exxon .
neither company has commented on the reports , but the mere possibility helped push share prices up by 6 percent in london on monday .
meanwhile , the obama administration has announced that it is imposing a new moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling , citing new evidence of safety concerns following the deepwater horizion oil spill in the gulf of mexico .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .
purchased at the same auction , the gallery actually paid more for the inferior imitation than for the genuine botticelli . author : dany mitzman -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .
purchased at the same auction , the gallery actually paid more for the inferior imitation than for the genuine botticelli . author : dany mitzman -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.07.2010 bp claims ' significant progress ' in battle to cap oil well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp confirms a well cap is in place to stem flow of oil from ruptured pipeline thirteen weeks after the oil catastrophe in the gulf of mexico , bp says it has successfully installed a cap to stop of the flow of oil into the sea .
tests on tuesday will determine if the oil spill has been stopped . " we have made significant progress .
this could lead to the shutting of the well , " admiral thad allen , head of the us government response effort , told the nbc television network on monday .
he was referring to the latest attempt to halt the massive oil slick in the gulf of mexico - which is still spewing vast amounts of crude into the ocean every day - by using underwater robots to install a new cap over the ruptured well .
" this containment cap will have the ability to actually close down valves and slowly contain all the oil , " allen said in another interview with news network cnn .
he said it will be possible to see how much pressure is in the well which will help determine whether or not its possible to shut the well for a period of time " , allen said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admiral thad allen , head of response effort , says progress is at hand " that could lead to one or two positive outcomes , " he continued .
" it could tell us that the well is withholding the pressure and we can shut it or just cap it , if you will .
either way those are two pretty good outcomes . "
the latest in a series of attempts to contain the spill comes 13 weeks after the deepwater horizon explosion that triggered the worst environmental disaster in american history .
thus far response efforts have been patchy , with energy giant bp managing little more than a partial mop-up .
the us government estimates that some 60,000 barrels of oil are flowing out of the ruptured pipe every day .
of that , less than half is currently being captured .
by july 10 , only 749,000 barrels had been collected or burned off by containment systems .
' planned and practised ' the latest operation entails the removal of the ineffective existing cap and its replacement with something called a transition spool .
once that has been bolted onto the pipe , a huge oil-collecting funnel , dubbed the " top hat 10 " can be put in place to start capturing oil .
bildunterschrift : damage done off the coast of louisiana kent wells , bp 's vice president , told reporters he was optimistic they 'd got it right this time .
" we are pleased with our progress , " he said .
" we have carefully planned and practised this whole procedure .
we 've tried to work out as many of the bugs as we can . "
in addition to the new system , which should give the first reliable indication of the overall flow , a new containment ship has been deployed to the area . bp is confident that the combination of the two will stop the previously unstoppable .
the vessel , called the helix producer , was originally due to be on its way by sunday , but was delayed until monday for technical reasons .
temporary measure in conjunction with the new cap , the helix producer ought to raise capture capacity from a current 25,000 barrels a day to as much as 80,000 barrels a day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the supertankers have not cleared up as much as necessary white house spokesman robert gibbs told nbc that efforts to stem the flow of crude had reached a critical stage .
" the new containment procedure will more than triple our capacity , " he said .
but even if it does prove successful , it is still only a temporary measure .
a long-term solution is not expected until the middle of august , when drilling of the first of two relief wells is expected to be finished .
that work was suspended on saturday in order for the robots to remove the old cap , but in a statement released on saturday , bp said the time frame was realistic .
" although uncertainty still exists , the first half of august remains the current estimate of the most likely date by which the first relief well will be completed and kill operations performed , " bp said .
picking up the tab bp says that while it is too early to put a number on the overall cost of the disaster , it has so far cost the cash-rich company a massive 2.78 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
that includes the cost of containment , relief well drilling , grants to the gulf states , federal costs and claims paid .
bildunterschrift : livelihoods have been crushed by the oil contamination on saturday , the british energy giant said it had received 105,000 claims and had made more than 52,000 payments thus far .
but with so much still outstanding , speculation about bp 's next move is rife .
british and us newspapers reported on monday that the beleaguered oil company was in talks to sell 9.5 billion euros of assets in order to create a more substantial disaster fund .
there is also much talk about bp becoming the target of a hostile takeover bid from us rival , exxon .
neither company has commented on the reports , but the mere possibility helped push share prices up by 6 percent in london on monday .
meanwhile , the obama administration has announced that it is imposing a new moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling , citing new evidence of safety concerns following the deepwater horizion oil spill in the gulf of mexico .

the market reaction , however , was muted . moody 's investor service , the international ratings agency , lowered portugal 's sovereign debt rating on tuesday by two grades to a1 from aa2 .
the agency said the country 's growth is still weak and that its debt continues to climb .
it said it expected portugal 's debt troubles to continue for the next two to three years and called on the government to enact further austerity measures in the 2011 budget .
the euro dropped to a one-week low of $ 1.2533 .
the wider market reaction was muted , however , as moody 's is only playing catch-up with rival agency standard & poor 's , which still rates portuguese debt two notches lower at a- .
" it does n't have the same impact as it would if the likes of s & p were to downgrade , given the move only brings -lsb- moody 's -rsb- in line , " sean maloney , a rate strategist at nomura , told reuters news agency .
city index analyst joshua raymond agreed , telling the afp wire service , " i do not think this took a lot of investors by surprise this morning , which is why the market reaction for europe as a whole has not been too severe thus far . "
" what the cut does do , however , is reaffirm the fragility of credit ratings for those countries with high debts and any cut in credit ratings is likely to be seen as a vote of no confidence , " he added .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .

with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .

the market reaction , however , was muted . moody 's investor service , the international ratings agency , lowered portugal 's sovereign debt rating on tuesday by two grades to a1 from aa2 .
the agency said the country 's growth is still weak and that its debt continues to climb .
it said it expected portugal 's debt troubles to continue for the next two to three years and called on the government to enact further austerity measures in the 2011 budget .
the euro dropped to a one-week low of $ 1.2533 .
the wider market reaction was muted , however , as moody 's is only playing catch-up with rival agency standard & poor 's , which still rates portuguese debt two notches lower at a- .
" it does n't have the same impact as it would if the likes of s & p were to downgrade , given the move only brings -lsb- moody 's -rsb- in line , " sean maloney , a rate strategist at nomura , told reuters news agency .
city index analyst joshua raymond agreed , telling the afp wire service , " i do not think this took a lot of investors by surprise this morning , which is why the market reaction for europe as a whole has not been too severe thus far . "
" what the cut does do , however , is reaffirm the fragility of credit ratings for those countries with high debts and any cut in credit ratings is likely to be seen as a vote of no confidence , " he added .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .
that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .
' fortress europe ' according to the eu 's employment commissioner , laszlo anders , immigrants have tended to be disproportionately over-represented in certain industries , like construction , making them especially vulnerable in the economic downturn .
" it 's important to get rid of stereotypes and fight the assumptions which are not really supported by evidence , " he said .
" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .
it also notes that in some countries there has been an increase in employment rates among immigrant women , who took up extra work after their husbands lost their jobs .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.07.2010 bp claims ' significant progress ' in battle to cap oil well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp confirms a well cap is in place to stem flow of oil from ruptured pipeline thirteen weeks after the oil catastrophe in the gulf of mexico , bp says it has successfully installed a cap to stop of the flow of oil into the sea .
tests on tuesday will determine if the oil spill has been stopped . " we have made significant progress .
this could lead to the shutting of the well , " admiral thad allen , head of the us government response effort , told the nbc television network on monday .
he was referring to the latest attempt to halt the massive oil slick in the gulf of mexico - which is still spewing vast amounts of crude into the ocean every day - by using underwater robots to install a new cap over the ruptured well .
" this containment cap will have the ability to actually close down valves and slowly contain all the oil , " allen said in another interview with news network cnn .
he said it will be possible to see how much pressure is in the well which will help determine whether or not its possible to shut the well for a period of time " , allen said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admiral thad allen , head of response effort , says progress is at hand " that could lead to one or two positive outcomes , " he continued .
" it could tell us that the well is withholding the pressure and we can shut it or just cap it , if you will .
either way those are two pretty good outcomes . "
the latest in a series of attempts to contain the spill comes 13 weeks after the deepwater horizon explosion that triggered the worst environmental disaster in american history .
thus far response efforts have been patchy , with energy giant bp managing little more than a partial mop-up .
the us government estimates that some 60,000 barrels of oil are flowing out of the ruptured pipe every day .
of that , less than half is currently being captured .
by july 10 , only 749,000 barrels had been collected or burned off by containment systems .
' planned and practised ' the latest operation entails the removal of the ineffective existing cap and its replacement with something called a transition spool .
once that has been bolted onto the pipe , a huge oil-collecting funnel , dubbed the " top hat 10 " can be put in place to start capturing oil .
bildunterschrift : damage done off the coast of louisiana kent wells , bp 's vice president , told reporters he was optimistic they 'd got it right this time .
" we are pleased with our progress , " he said .
" we have carefully planned and practised this whole procedure .
we 've tried to work out as many of the bugs as we can . "
in addition to the new system , which should give the first reliable indication of the overall flow , a new containment ship has been deployed to the area . bp is confident that the combination of the two will stop the previously unstoppable .
the vessel , called the helix producer , was originally due to be on its way by sunday , but was delayed until monday for technical reasons .
temporary measure in conjunction with the new cap , the helix producer ought to raise capture capacity from a current 25,000 barrels a day to as much as 80,000 barrels a day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the supertankers have not cleared up as much as necessary white house spokesman robert gibbs told nbc that efforts to stem the flow of crude had reached a critical stage .
" the new containment procedure will more than triple our capacity , " he said .
but even if it does prove successful , it is still only a temporary measure .
a long-term solution is not expected until the middle of august , when drilling of the first of two relief wells is expected to be finished .
that work was suspended on saturday in order for the robots to remove the old cap , but in a statement released on saturday , bp said the time frame was realistic .
" although uncertainty still exists , the first half of august remains the current estimate of the most likely date by which the first relief well will be completed and kill operations performed , " bp said .
picking up the tab bp says that while it is too early to put a number on the overall cost of the disaster , it has so far cost the cash-rich company a massive 2.78 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
that includes the cost of containment , relief well drilling , grants to the gulf states , federal costs and claims paid .
bildunterschrift : livelihoods have been crushed by the oil contamination on saturday , the british energy giant said it had received 105,000 claims and had made more than 52,000 payments thus far .
but with so much still outstanding , speculation about bp 's next move is rife .
british and us newspapers reported on monday that the beleaguered oil company was in talks to sell 9.5 billion euros of assets in order to create a more substantial disaster fund .
there is also much talk about bp becoming the target of a hostile takeover bid from us rival , exxon .
neither company has commented on the reports , but the mere possibility helped push share prices up by 6 percent in london on monday .
meanwhile , the obama administration has announced that it is imposing a new moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling , citing new evidence of safety concerns following the deepwater horizion oil spill in the gulf of mexico .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "

the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .
purchased at the same auction , the gallery actually paid more for the inferior imitation than for the genuine botticelli . author : dany mitzman -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

the market reaction , however , was muted . moody 's investor service , the international ratings agency , lowered portugal 's sovereign debt rating on tuesday by two grades to a1 from aa2 .
the agency said the country 's growth is still weak and that its debt continues to climb .
it said it expected portugal 's debt troubles to continue for the next two to three years and called on the government to enact further austerity measures in the 2011 budget .
the euro dropped to a one-week low of $ 1.2533 .
the wider market reaction was muted , however , as moody 's is only playing catch-up with rival agency standard & poor 's , which still rates portuguese debt two notches lower at a- .
" it does n't have the same impact as it would if the likes of s & p were to downgrade , given the move only brings -lsb- moody 's -rsb- in line , " sean maloney , a rate strategist at nomura , told reuters news agency .
city index analyst joshua raymond agreed , telling the afp wire service , " i do not think this took a lot of investors by surprise this morning , which is why the market reaction for europe as a whole has not been too severe thus far . "
" what the cut does do , however , is reaffirm the fragility of credit ratings for those countries with high debts and any cut in credit ratings is likely to be seen as a vote of no confidence , " he added .

the un command said in a statement the north 's army representatives requested a delay " for administrative reasons " .
no new time has been set .
a joint team of investigators involving military officers and civilian experts from the south , the united states and sweden in may accused the north of launching a torpedo attack on the south korean warship cheonan , killing 46 sailors .
military officers from north korea and the un command that oversees the korean war truce were to meet at the korean border of panmunjom to discuss the sinking of the ship .
it would have been the first meeting since the sinking on march 26 , which sharply raised tension on the divided korean peninsula .
bildunterschrift : the talks were supposed to take place in the border village of panmunjom diplomatic tussles the north denies it was involved in the sinking and has accused the south of masterminding a fabrication for political gain .
on friday , the un security council in a statement condemned the attack but did not directly blame the north , apparently in a concession to china , a permanent member and north korea 's only ally .
north korea celebrated the statement as a diplomatic victory .
" problems on the korean peninsula can only be resolved through the peaceful methods of talks and negotiation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesperson qin gang told a regular news briefing in beijing on tuesday .
" a war of words , or even using military means , can not fundamentally resolve the issues " .
the two allies us and south korea have planned a naval exercise as a show of strength following the attack in march .
the location has not been decided .
it was originally planned for the yellow sea , but this caused strong protests from china .
observers have pointed out that north korea 's decision to put off the cheonan talks could be related to its dismay about the war games. jb / reuters / afp / ap editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the market reaction , however , was muted . moody 's investor service , the international ratings agency , lowered portugal 's sovereign debt rating on tuesday by two grades to a1 from aa2 .
the agency said the country 's growth is still weak and that its debt continues to climb .
it said it expected portugal 's debt troubles to continue for the next two to three years and called on the government to enact further austerity measures in the 2011 budget .
the euro dropped to a one-week low of $ 1.2533 .
the wider market reaction was muted , however , as moody 's is only playing catch-up with rival agency standard & poor 's , which still rates portuguese debt two notches lower at a- .
" it does n't have the same impact as it would if the likes of s & p were to downgrade , given the move only brings -lsb- moody 's -rsb- in line , " sean maloney , a rate strategist at nomura , told reuters news agency .
city index analyst joshua raymond agreed , telling the afp wire service , " i do not think this took a lot of investors by surprise this morning , which is why the market reaction for europe as a whole has not been too severe thus far . "
" what the cut does do , however , is reaffirm the fragility of credit ratings for those countries with high debts and any cut in credit ratings is likely to be seen as a vote of no confidence , " he added .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .
the local traders are looking for around 50-60 items to trade .

it was the president 's first state visit to germany 's eastern neighbor . on his first visit to poland as germany 's new president on tuesday , christian wulff met with president-elect bronislaw komorowski and pledged to strengthen polish-german relations . both the new german president and his polish counterpart-to-be spoke about the coincidence that made both of them start their term in office at more or less the same time . wulff was elected on june 30 following the resignation of former president horst koehler in may . komorowski replaces the late president lech kaczynski , who along with his wife and 94 passengers was killed in an air crash in russia in april . the men took the opportunity of their first meeting to look ahead to a new level of cooperation between the two countries . komorowski spoke of the idea of patronage to be extended by both leaders over initiatives aimed at building rapprochement between the two nations . " we attach special attention to youth exchange schemes , " said komorowski .
he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .
the public supports the president-elect 's moves to improve relations with the poland 's closest neighbors , including germany . the specter of german domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff also met with polish prime minister donald tusk observers note that the visit by the new german president coincides with events marking the 600th anniversary of the battle of grunwald , in which polish and lithuanian troops defeated the teutonic knights , a german order of crusaders who made incursions against their neighbours .
this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "
opinion polls reveal that some of the polish electorate is still responsive to xenophobic rhetoric .
the situation is further complicated by the recent presidential campaign , in which the late president 's patriotic agenda and his attachment to history were exploited by his twin brother .
as poland 's two liberal leaders , komorowski and prime minister donald tusk , set out to build new bridges , internal polish politics are still likely to cast a shadow over polish-german relations .

he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .
the public supports the president-elect 's moves to improve relations with the poland 's closest neighbors , including germany . the specter of german domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff also met with polish prime minister donald tusk observers note that the visit by the new german president coincides with events marking the 600th anniversary of the battle of grunwald , in which polish and lithuanian troops defeated the teutonic knights , a german order of crusaders who made incursions against their neighbours .
this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "
opinion polls reveal that some of the polish electorate is still responsive to xenophobic rhetoric .
the situation is further complicated by the recent presidential campaign , in which the late president 's patriotic agenda and his attachment to history were exploited by his twin brother .
as poland 's two liberal leaders , komorowski and prime minister donald tusk , set out to build new bridges , internal polish politics are still likely to cast a shadow over polish-german relations .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice . " so health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine . homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the united kingdom , where the british medical association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the national health service should fund its use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in meissen , saxony scarce scientific evidence for practice nearly all medical officials agree with lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment . " if everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said dr. kay brune , a professor in the department of experimental and clinical pharmacology and toxicology at friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nuernberg , in southern germany . brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the german psyche . " homeopathy has a very long tradition in germany , " he added in an interview with deutsche welle .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the evidence , many germans still engage in homeopathic practices homeopathy costs are a drop in the bucket brune also said that even if politicians do manage to get rid of it from public insurance , they may be wasting their time because relatively little money is actually spent on homeopathy on an annual basis . " my estimate is 100 million euros -lsb- are spent on homeopathy annually -rsb- , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in germany , " he said . according to germany 's pharmaceutical industry federation -lrb- bpi -rrb- , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros german public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually . in the end though , brune added that because so many germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it . according to a recent study by the allensbach institute , a public opinion research firm in southern germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

now , he can relax and retire in his aquarium in oberhausen , in northern germany .
a village in spain , however , would like to give him a new home . for weeks during the world cup , long lines formed in front of the sea life aquarium in oberhausen despite the summer heat , with people waiting patiently to enter the park .
an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .
and paul is an attraction .
paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .
two years ago , during the european football championship , paul gave the first samples of his abilities as an oracle .
how does he do it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul correctly picked the winner of all of germany 's matches paul loves mussels . during the 2008 tournament , someone came up with the idea to take two glass containers , drape each with the flag of one of the competing teams , and place a mussel inside .
enter paul the octopus , who would hover over the boxes , choose one of the mussels and fish it out - thus predicting which team would win that particular match .
sounds easy , but it is n't .
the aquarium followed the same procedure this year during the world cup , and paul was right every time . people wondered how he did it , and turned to scientists .
as it turns out , there are plenty of answers , not all of them scientific .
favorite color or sense of smell ?
one explanation : the color combination .
maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .
but even in this case , the prediction 's concurrence with the actual outcome of the match leaves too much room for coincidence .
bildunterschrift : many a german wished this fate on paul bodyguards for an octopus be that as it may , paul has gained worldwide fame . and like every other star , he does n't only have fans .
threats from disappointed german and dutch soccer fans can be found on the internet under " octopus paul , we know where your tank is . "
the internet was swamped by octopus recipes and pictures of octopuses hung out to dry .
a video on youtube showed brutal scenes from chinese restaurants , where live octopuses were tossed into a boiling liquid .
but none of that really matters to cuddly paul in his oberhausen aquarium .
sea life arranged for 24 hour ' security ' for the animal , successfully fending off any cowardly attacks .
retired octopus now that the world cup is over , the hoopla has died down somewhat .
which is a good thing .
after all , paul is two-and-a-half years old , a respectable age for an octopus .
he needs his rest .
as a matter of fact , paul might not be around much longer . while sea life wants to make sure he is content until he dies , paul 's fans do n't want him to retire .
the aquarium receives hundreds of emails every day with oracle questions for the mollusk .
questions like : " how long will merkel 's coalition last ? " or " am i going to get a d in math this year ? " are fun , but paul , according to scientific expertise , ca n't answer them .
so , in the end , the soothsaying octopus can peacefully swim through his tank toward that eternal resting place under water .
spain misses out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paella is not to be the famous oracle 's fate after all a generous offer from spain is not likely to change his fate .
a village in the northwestern part of the country has collected money and would like to buy paul for 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,720 -rrb- .
they want him to perform , though not as an oracle but as a mascot for a food festival with plenty of octopus specialties on the menu . evil be to him who evil thinks ...
but sea life in oberhausen wo n't be swayed by the tempting offer .
oberhausen is where paul will stay , where it 's clear this octopus is not going to end up in a paella .

the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice . " so health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine . homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the united kingdom , where the british medical association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the national health service should fund its use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in meissen , saxony scarce scientific evidence for practice nearly all medical officials agree with lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment . " if everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said dr. kay brune , a professor in the department of experimental and clinical pharmacology and toxicology at friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nuernberg , in southern germany . brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the german psyche . " homeopathy has a very long tradition in germany , " he added in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the founder , hahnemann was a brilliant physician .
but at that time doing nothing was helpful to the patient .
in 200 years , the pseudo-science has not taken any steps forward . " he also added that under the third reich , nazi medical officials explored it as a " non-jewish medicine , " and even they gave up on it . other german politicians have since jumped on the bandwagon , including rainer hess of the federal joint committee for doctors and insurers who described the current situation concerning homeopathy as " extremely unsatisfactory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the evidence , many germans still engage in homeopathic practices homeopathy costs are a drop in the bucket brune also said that even if politicians do manage to get rid of it from public insurance , they may be wasting their time because relatively little money is actually spent on homeopathy on an annual basis . " my estimate is 100 million euros -lsb- are spent on homeopathy annually -rsb- , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in germany , " he said . according to germany 's pharmaceutical industry federation -lrb- bpi -rrb- , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros german public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually . in the end though , brune added that because so many germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it . according to a recent study by the allensbach institute , a public opinion research firm in southern germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .
" they will make a compromise and under certain circumstances they will pay for it as they do for acupuncture .
it satisfies the health need at the lowest possible cost . " author : cyrus farivar editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .

the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice . " so health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine . homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the united kingdom , where the british medical association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the national health service should fund its use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in meissen , saxony scarce scientific evidence for practice nearly all medical officials agree with lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment . " if everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said dr. kay brune , a professor in the department of experimental and clinical pharmacology and toxicology at friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nuernberg , in southern germany . brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the german psyche . " homeopathy has a very long tradition in germany , " he added in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the founder , hahnemann was a brilliant physician .
but at that time doing nothing was helpful to the patient .
in 200 years , the pseudo-science has not taken any steps forward . " he also added that under the third reich , nazi medical officials explored it as a " non-jewish medicine , " and even they gave up on it . other german politicians have since jumped on the bandwagon , including rainer hess of the federal joint committee for doctors and insurers who described the current situation concerning homeopathy as " extremely unsatisfactory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the evidence , many germans still engage in homeopathic practices homeopathy costs are a drop in the bucket brune also said that even if politicians do manage to get rid of it from public insurance , they may be wasting their time because relatively little money is actually spent on homeopathy on an annual basis . " my estimate is 100 million euros -lsb- are spent on homeopathy annually -rsb- , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in germany , " he said . according to germany 's pharmaceutical industry federation -lrb- bpi -rrb- , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros german public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually . in the end though , brune added that because so many germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it . according to a recent study by the allensbach institute , a public opinion research firm in southern germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .
" they will make a compromise and under certain circumstances they will pay for it as they do for acupuncture .
it satisfies the health need at the lowest possible cost . " author : cyrus farivar editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .
that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .

cambodia is the country most affected outside the south asian subcontinent . the cambodian acid survivors charity -lrb- casc -rrb- is based at a house on a hectare of land outside phnom penh .
in the front room a group of a dozen men and women are resting or getting physiotherapy treatment .
all have been burned by acid . statistics from casc show that more than half of acid victims are deliberately attacked .
casc has recorded 103 people burned with acid in the past five years , with another 16 so far this year .
but its coordinator ziad samman says the true number is likely far higher since casc sees only a fraction of those hurt . easy availability of acid acid is cheap , widely used , and easily available in cambodia .
it delivers an extraordinarily graphic injury .
in a deliberate attack , acid is often poured over the victim 's face .
it takes just seconds to melt facial features , and keeps burning through skin and even bone .
those who survive typically bear terrible scars . in recent years the rising number of acid attacks has put pressure on the government to act .
it recently drafted a law to deal with the problem . " the government is dead serious .
this can not go on , " says sieng lapresse , a senior official at the ministry of interior .
" we do not allow this horrible weapon to kill our society and our own people . " bildunterschrift : acid attack survivors in the treatment room at casc , the cambodian acid survivors charity , outside phnom penh new law against the crime sieng lapresse has been tasked with collating the draft law .
he says the law , which should be passed before the end of the year , will regulate sales of acid , with vendors bearing legal responsibility for those to whom they sell it .
penalties for those found guilty of throwing acid will be severe . " we are looking for from at least ten years to life in prison , " he says . samman says people have a number of misconceptions about acid attacks : many are surprised to learn that men comprise around half of casc 's 260 clients over the years . saroeun is one such victim .
until six months ago he worked as a security guard at a hotel in phnom penh , when an attacker poured acid on him .
his face and right arm bear significant scarring .
he welcomes the proposed new law . " the new law is very significant for khmer society as it targets those people who want to throw acid , " says saroeun .
" i really want the government to strongly enforce this law against people who throw acid , because acid causes a lot of suffering and has a very dangerous effect . " raising awareness saroeun would also like the government to outlaw discrimination by employers against people with disabilities . casc 's anecdotal research indicates many people do not regard throwing acid as a crime .
educating about that and about how to provide first aid for victims - pouring water over the burn to dilute the acid - would also help . one problem the law is unlikely to resolve is impunity for powerful people who have been behind several high-profile attacks in recent years . author : robert carmichael -lrb- phnom penh -rrb- editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wants to devolve power to national governments , but it seems to have upset both gm proponents and detractors alike . in an unprecedented step to hand european union powers back to member states , the bloc 's executive - the european commission - has drafted plans to give countries the freedom to decide for themselves whether to grow or ban genetically modified crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european health commissioner john dalli says the executive is neutral the move is the result of frustration over years of deadlock over introducing the technology into the eu . the proposal would enable member states to prohibit the cultivation of gm crops that have already been scientifically approved , using economic , social and ethical reasons as the justification for the bans . countries would have the power to prohibit cultivating the crops on all or part of their territories . under the current system , gm crop applications are examined by a panel of experts from eu states and need to pass with a qualified majority .
in the case of a deadlock , the decision goes to eu ministers and if an impasse persists , the european commission is left with the final decision . to date , only two varieties of gm crops have been approved in the bloc , compared to around 150 world-wide . more legal disputes ? opponents of genetically modified food are worried that biotech companies will take advantage of the new proposal to force more of their products into the union . " any country wanting to ban gm crops under these proposals will open themselves up to legal challenges from the biotech corporations who want to force gm crops into europe , " said mute schimpf , food campaigner for environmental group friends of the earth europe . the uk-based organization gm freeze warned that members of the eu opposed to gm crops could be exposed to fresh trade complaints , which would be difficult to defend against . " member states should approach the commission 's proposals claiming to facilitate bans on gm crops with extreme caution , " said pete riley , campaigns director at gm freeze . " they need to ensure that in the short and long term that they will be able to ban a gm crop without ending up in court or with a wto dispute . " riley said he was n't categorically opposed to the proposal . allowing member states the right to make the final decision on gm crops is " the right thing to do , " he said , but he is concerned that what is on the table " appears to be subject to last minute changes . " biotech disappointment however , far from celebrating a business opportunity , some biotech proponents are expressing concerns about the prospects of more – not fewer – legal battles in future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in early 2010 , the eu authorized the cultivation of the genetically modified amflora potato " our fear is that it -lrb- the proposal -rrb- will be misused by governments to ban products indiscriminately , " carel du marchie sarvaas - from the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- - told deutsche welle . " we are science-based people , so when we hear politicians say that it 's ok to ban something for political reasons , we find that hard to live with . " " you 're going to have different rules in different eu countries , " said julian little , spokesman for german biotech firm bayer cropscience . " it 's just inviting legal disputes , and the lawyers are going to love it . " farming perspective farmers are also unimpressed . copa-cogeca - an organization representing farmers and agricultural cooperatives in the eu - is worried that differing rules between european countries would jeopardize the eu 's internal market and distort competition between the bloc 's farmers . " this will result in new legal and commercial risks , which farmers can not cover themselves , " said copa-cogeca secretary-general pekka pesonen . " we also urge the commission to make sure that the independent eu food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- risk assessment process remains the basis of the gm authorization system , " added pesonen . however , the european commission appears determined to push through with its plans , and is no stranger to hostility on the issue - having defended the bloc 's current policy in global trade disputes while facing pressure at home for approving gm products in the first place . the new proposals have been designed to try and minimize the chances for governments or the european parliament to block or change them . author : eva wutke -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wants to devolve power to national governments , but it seems to have upset both gm proponents and detractors alike . in an unprecedented step to hand european union powers back to member states , the bloc 's executive - the european commission - has drafted plans to give countries the freedom to decide for themselves whether to grow or ban genetically modified crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european health commissioner john dalli says the executive is neutral the move is the result of frustration over years of deadlock over introducing the technology into the eu . the proposal would enable member states to prohibit the cultivation of gm crops that have already been scientifically approved , using economic , social and ethical reasons as the justification for the bans . countries would have the power to prohibit cultivating the crops on all or part of their territories . under the current system , gm crop applications are examined by a panel of experts from eu states and need to pass with a qualified majority .
in the case of a deadlock , the decision goes to eu ministers and if an impasse persists , the european commission is left with the final decision . to date , only two varieties of gm crops have been approved in the bloc , compared to around 150 world-wide . more legal disputes ? opponents of genetically modified food are worried that biotech companies will take advantage of the new proposal to force more of their products into the union . " any country wanting to ban gm crops under these proposals will open themselves up to legal challenges from the biotech corporations who want to force gm crops into europe , " said mute schimpf , food campaigner for environmental group friends of the earth europe . the uk-based organization gm freeze warned that members of the eu opposed to gm crops could be exposed to fresh trade complaints , which would be difficult to defend against . " member states should approach the commission 's proposals claiming to facilitate bans on gm crops with extreme caution , " said pete riley , campaigns director at gm freeze . " they need to ensure that in the short and long term that they will be able to ban a gm crop without ending up in court or with a wto dispute .

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.07.2010 paul the octopus retires , but a future in spain beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oracle paul has become famous paul the octopus was an uncanny judge of germany 's world cup fortunes .
now , he can relax and retire in his aquarium in oberhausen , in northern germany .
a village in spain , however , would like to give him a new home . for weeks during the world cup , long lines formed in front of the sea life aquarium in oberhausen despite the summer heat , with people waiting patiently to enter the park .
an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .
and paul is an attraction .
paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .
two years ago , during the european football championship , paul gave the first samples of his abilities as an oracle .
how does he do it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul correctly picked the winner of all of germany 's matches paul loves mussels . during the 2008 tournament , someone came up with the idea to take two glass containers , drape each with the flag of one of the competing teams , and place a mussel inside .
enter paul the octopus , who would hover over the boxes , choose one of the mussels and fish it out - thus predicting which team would win that particular match .
sounds easy , but it is n't .
the aquarium followed the same procedure this year during the world cup , and paul was right every time . people wondered how he did it , and turned to scientists .
as it turns out , there are plenty of answers , not all of them scientific .
favorite color or sense of smell ?
one explanation : the color combination .
maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .
but even in this case , the prediction 's concurrence with the actual outcome of the match leaves too much room for coincidence .
bildunterschrift : many a german wished this fate on paul bodyguards for an octopus be that as it may , paul has gained worldwide fame . and like every other star , he does n't only have fans .
threats from disappointed german and dutch soccer fans can be found on the internet under " octopus paul , we know where your tank is . "
the internet was swamped by octopus recipes and pictures of octopuses hung out to dry .
a video on youtube showed brutal scenes from chinese restaurants , where live octopuses were tossed into a boiling liquid .
but none of that really matters to cuddly paul in his oberhausen aquarium .
sea life arranged for 24 hour ' security ' for the animal , successfully fending off any cowardly attacks .
retired octopus now that the world cup is over , the hoopla has died down somewhat .
which is a good thing .
after all , paul is two-and-a-half years old , a respectable age for an octopus .
he needs his rest .
as a matter of fact , paul might not be around much longer . while sea life wants to make sure he is content until he dies , paul 's fans do n't want him to retire .
the aquarium receives hundreds of emails every day with oracle questions for the mollusk .
questions like : " how long will merkel 's coalition last ? " or " am i going to get a d in math this year ? " are fun , but paul , according to scientific expertise , ca n't answer them .
so , in the end , the soothsaying octopus can peacefully swim through his tank toward that eternal resting place under water .
spain misses out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paella is not to be the famous oracle 's fate after all a generous offer from spain is not likely to change his fate .
a village in the northwestern part of the country has collected money and would like to buy paul for 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,720 -rrb- .
they want him to perform , though not as an oracle but as a mascot for a food festival with plenty of octopus specialties on the menu . evil be to him who evil thinks ...
but sea life in oberhausen wo n't be swayed by the tempting offer .
oberhausen is where paul will stay , where it 's clear this octopus is not going to end up in a paella .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

it was the president 's first state visit to germany 's eastern neighbor . on his first visit to poland as germany 's new president on tuesday , christian wulff met with president-elect bronislaw komorowski and pledged to strengthen polish-german relations . both the new german president and his polish counterpart-to-be spoke about the coincidence that made both of them start their term in office at more or less the same time . wulff was elected on june 30 following the resignation of former president horst koehler in may . komorowski replaces the late president lech kaczynski , who along with his wife and 94 passengers was killed in an air crash in russia in april . the men took the opportunity of their first meeting to look ahead to a new level of cooperation between the two countries . komorowski spoke of the idea of patronage to be extended by both leaders over initiatives aimed at building rapprochement between the two nations . " we attach special attention to youth exchange schemes , " said komorowski .
he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .
the public supports the president-elect 's moves to improve relations with the poland 's closest neighbors , including germany . the specter of german domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff also met with polish prime minister donald tusk observers note that the visit by the new german president coincides with events marking the 600th anniversary of the battle of grunwald , in which polish and lithuanian troops defeated the teutonic knights , a german order of crusaders who made incursions against their neighbours .
this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "
opinion polls reveal that some of the polish electorate is still responsive to xenophobic rhetoric .
the situation is further complicated by the recent presidential campaign , in which the late president 's patriotic agenda and his attachment to history were exploited by his twin brother .
as poland 's two liberal leaders , komorowski and prime minister donald tusk , set out to build new bridges , internal polish politics are still likely to cast a shadow over polish-german relations .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .

new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .

government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .
that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .
' fortress europe ' according to the eu 's employment commissioner , laszlo anders , immigrants have tended to be disproportionately over-represented in certain industries , like construction , making them especially vulnerable in the economic downturn .
" it 's important to get rid of stereotypes and fight the assumptions which are not really supported by evidence , " he said .
" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .
it also notes that in some countries there has been an increase in employment rates among immigrant women , who took up extra work after their husbands lost their jobs .
migrants in germany to be promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's malmstom says the 27-nation block needs a long-term migration policy faced with a sharp drop in the number of skilled workers in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's government and the federal labor agency have proposed ways of promoting migrants ' qualifications .
statistics show that the qualifications levels among young people with migration backgrounds are far too low . maria boehmer , the government official responsible for migration , says that too many foreigners are currently employed in jobs below their qualifications .
the cdu politician has announced that she would be proposing draft legislation by the end of the year that would speed up and simplify recognition of foreign academic qualifications . the opposition green party has urged the center-right governing coalition to make it easier for foreigners living in germany to obtain german citizenship . it argues that citizenship tests should be abolished and that it should be generally possible for people becoming germans to retain their original citizenship .

the market reaction , however , was muted . moody 's investor service , the international ratings agency , lowered portugal 's sovereign debt rating on tuesday by two grades to a1 from aa2 .
the agency said the country 's growth is still weak and that its debt continues to climb .
it said it expected portugal 's debt troubles to continue for the next two to three years and called on the government to enact further austerity measures in the 2011 budget .
the euro dropped to a one-week low of $ 1.2533 .
the wider market reaction was muted , however , as moody 's is only playing catch-up with rival agency standard & poor 's , which still rates portuguese debt two notches lower at a- .
" it does n't have the same impact as it would if the likes of s & p were to downgrade , given the move only brings -lsb- moody 's -rsb- in line , " sean maloney , a rate strategist at nomura , told reuters news agency .
city index analyst joshua raymond agreed , telling the afp wire service , " i do not think this took a lot of investors by surprise this morning , which is why the market reaction for europe as a whole has not been too severe thus far . "
" what the cut does do , however , is reaffirm the fragility of credit ratings for those countries with high debts and any cut in credit ratings is likely to be seen as a vote of no confidence , " he added .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .
that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .
' fortress europe ' according to the eu 's employment commissioner , laszlo anders , immigrants have tended to be disproportionately over-represented in certain industries , like construction , making them especially vulnerable in the economic downturn .
" it 's important to get rid of stereotypes and fight the assumptions which are not really supported by evidence , " he said .
" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .
it also notes that in some countries there has been an increase in employment rates among immigrant women , who took up extra work after their husbands lost their jobs .

statistics show that the qualifications levels among young people with migration backgrounds are far too low . maria boehmer , the government official responsible for migration , says that too many foreigners are currently employed in jobs below their qualifications .
the cdu politician has announced that she would be proposing draft legislation by the end of the year that would speed up and simplify recognition of foreign academic qualifications . the opposition green party has urged the center-right governing coalition to make it easier for foreigners living in germany to obtain german citizenship . it argues that citizenship tests should be abolished and that it should be generally possible for people becoming germans to retain their original citizenship .

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .
that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .
' fortress europe ' according to the eu 's employment commissioner , laszlo anders , immigrants have tended to be disproportionately over-represented in certain industries , like construction , making them especially vulnerable in the economic downturn .
" it 's important to get rid of stereotypes and fight the assumptions which are not really supported by evidence , " he said .
" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .
it also notes that in some countries there has been an increase in employment rates among immigrant women , who took up extra work after their husbands lost their jobs .
migrants in germany to be promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's malmstom says the 27-nation block needs a long-term migration policy faced with a sharp drop in the number of skilled workers in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's government and the federal labor agency have proposed ways of promoting migrants ' qualifications .
statistics show that the qualifications levels among young people with migration backgrounds are far too low . maria boehmer , the government official responsible for migration , says that too many foreigners are currently employed in jobs below their qualifications .
the cdu politician has announced that she would be proposing draft legislation by the end of the year that would speed up and simplify recognition of foreign academic qualifications . the opposition green party has urged the center-right governing coalition to make it easier for foreigners living in germany to obtain german citizenship . it argues that citizenship tests should be abolished and that it should be generally possible for people becoming germans to retain their original citizenship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.07.2010 paul the octopus retires , but a future in spain beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oracle paul has become famous paul the octopus was an uncanny judge of germany 's world cup fortunes .
now , he can relax and retire in his aquarium in oberhausen , in northern germany .
a village in spain , however , would like to give him a new home . for weeks during the world cup , long lines formed in front of the sea life aquarium in oberhausen despite the summer heat , with people waiting patiently to enter the park .
an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .
and paul is an attraction .
paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .
two years ago , during the european football championship , paul gave the first samples of his abilities as an oracle .
how does he do it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul correctly picked the winner of all of germany 's matches paul loves mussels . during the 2008 tournament , someone came up with the idea to take two glass containers , drape each with the flag of one of the competing teams , and place a mussel inside .
enter paul the octopus , who would hover over the boxes , choose one of the mussels and fish it out - thus predicting which team would win that particular match .
sounds easy , but it is n't .
the aquarium followed the same procedure this year during the world cup , and paul was right every time . people wondered how he did it , and turned to scientists .
as it turns out , there are plenty of answers , not all of them scientific .
favorite color or sense of smell ?
one explanation : the color combination .
maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .
but even in this case , the prediction 's concurrence with the actual outcome of the match leaves too much room for coincidence .
bildunterschrift : many a german wished this fate on paul bodyguards for an octopus be that as it may , paul has gained worldwide fame . and like every other star , he does n't only have fans .
threats from disappointed german and dutch soccer fans can be found on the internet under " octopus paul , we know where your tank is . "
the internet was swamped by octopus recipes and pictures of octopuses hung out to dry .
a video on youtube showed brutal scenes from chinese restaurants , where live octopuses were tossed into a boiling liquid .
but none of that really matters to cuddly paul in his oberhausen aquarium .
sea life arranged for 24 hour ' security ' for the animal , successfully fending off any cowardly attacks .
retired octopus now that the world cup is over , the hoopla has died down somewhat .
which is a good thing .
after all , paul is two-and-a-half years old , a respectable age for an octopus .
he needs his rest .
as a matter of fact , paul might not be around much longer . while sea life wants to make sure he is content until he dies , paul 's fans do n't want him to retire .
the aquarium receives hundreds of emails every day with oracle questions for the mollusk .
questions like : " how long will merkel 's coalition last ? " or " am i going to get a d in math this year ? " are fun , but paul , according to scientific expertise , ca n't answer them .
so , in the end , the soothsaying octopus can peacefully swim through his tank toward that eternal resting place under water .
spain misses out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paella is not to be the famous oracle 's fate after all a generous offer from spain is not likely to change his fate .
a village in the northwestern part of the country has collected money and would like to buy paul for 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,720 -rrb- .
they want him to perform , though not as an oracle but as a mascot for a food festival with plenty of octopus specialties on the menu . evil be to him who evil thinks ...
but sea life in oberhausen wo n't be swayed by the tempting offer .
oberhausen is where paul will stay , where it 's clear this octopus is not going to end up in a paella .

the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice . " so health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine . homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the united kingdom , where the british medical association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the national health service should fund its use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in meissen , saxony scarce scientific evidence for practice nearly all medical officials agree with lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment . " if everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said dr. kay brune , a professor in the department of experimental and clinical pharmacology and toxicology at friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nuernberg , in southern germany . brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the german psyche . " homeopathy has a very long tradition in germany , " he added in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the founder , hahnemann was a brilliant physician .
but at that time doing nothing was helpful to the patient .
in 200 years , the pseudo-science has not taken any steps forward . " he also added that under the third reich , nazi medical officials explored it as a " non-jewish medicine , " and even they gave up on it . other german politicians have since jumped on the bandwagon , including rainer hess of the federal joint committee for doctors and insurers who described the current situation concerning homeopathy as " extremely unsatisfactory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the evidence , many germans still engage in homeopathic practices homeopathy costs are a drop in the bucket brune also said that even if politicians do manage to get rid of it from public insurance , they may be wasting their time because relatively little money is actually spent on homeopathy on an annual basis . " my estimate is 100 million euros -lsb- are spent on homeopathy annually -rsb- , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in germany , " he said . according to germany 's pharmaceutical industry federation -lrb- bpi -rrb- , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros german public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually . in the end though , brune added that because so many germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it . according to a recent study by the allensbach institute , a public opinion research firm in southern germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .
" they will make a compromise and under certain circumstances they will pay for it as they do for acupuncture .
it satisfies the health need at the lowest possible cost . " author : cyrus farivar editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" my estimate is 100 million euros -lsb- are spent on homeopathy annually -rsb- , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in germany , " he said . according to germany 's pharmaceutical industry federation -lrb- bpi -rrb- , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros german public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually . in the end though , brune added that because so many germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it . according to a recent study by the allensbach institute , a public opinion research firm in southern germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .
" they will make a compromise and under certain circumstances they will pay for it as they do for acupuncture .
it satisfies the health need at the lowest possible cost . " author : cyrus farivar editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the president 's first state visit to germany 's eastern neighbor . on his first visit to poland as germany 's new president on tuesday , christian wulff met with president-elect bronislaw komorowski and pledged to strengthen polish-german relations . both the new german president and his polish counterpart-to-be spoke about the coincidence that made both of them start their term in office at more or less the same time . wulff was elected on june 30 following the resignation of former president horst koehler in may . komorowski replaces the late president lech kaczynski , who along with his wife and 94 passengers was killed in an air crash in russia in april . the men took the opportunity of their first meeting to look ahead to a new level of cooperation between the two countries . komorowski spoke of the idea of patronage to be extended by both leaders over initiatives aimed at building rapprochement between the two nations . " we attach special attention to youth exchange schemes , " said komorowski .
he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .
the public supports the president-elect 's moves to improve relations with the poland 's closest neighbors , including germany . the specter of german domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff also met with polish prime minister donald tusk observers note that the visit by the new german president coincides with events marking the 600th anniversary of the battle of grunwald , in which polish and lithuanian troops defeated the teutonic knights , a german order of crusaders who made incursions against their neighbours .
this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "
opinion polls reveal that some of the polish electorate is still responsive to xenophobic rhetoric .
the situation is further complicated by the recent presidential campaign , in which the late president 's patriotic agenda and his attachment to history were exploited by his twin brother .
as poland 's two liberal leaders , komorowski and prime minister donald tusk , set out to build new bridges , internal polish politics are still likely to cast a shadow over polish-german relations .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .
purchased at the same auction , the gallery actually paid more for the inferior imitation than for the genuine botticelli . author : dany mitzman -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the desire is to do it in the most transparent way possible , including by presenting the exposure of different institutions to sovereign debt , " belgian finance minister didier reynders , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told a news conference .
while france questions the need to fully publish exposure to sovereign debt and stressed the difficulty of establishing a harmonized tier one - or capital - ratio for european banks , germany , spain and britain are in favor of full disclosure , according to the reuters news agency , quoting unnamed sources .
avoiding bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the eu is prepared if banks fail the stress tests eu ministers agreed that any bank pushed to the brink of collapse would be eligible for a state bailout , but with strict conditions attached .
" first , an institution which is in trouble should raise capital on the markets .
if this does not work , the state should help .
if the state is not in a position to do it ... the state can turn to the -lsb- rescue system -rsb- , but only under the conditions which the rules impose , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on tuesday .
some german and spanish banks are seen as the weakest links in the european banking system .
according to a study by pricewaterhousecoopers , german banks had the highest number of bad loans on their books at the end of 2009 , amounting to over 212 billion euros -lrb- $ 269 -rrb- .
doubts over banks ' abilities to clean up their balance sheets have hampered efforts to raise funding and made them dependent on liquidity provided by the european central bank in the wake of the global financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london is home to one of the biggest financial markets in the world new watchdog there was greater progress on the establishment of a cross-border financial watchdog for europe .
ministers handed belgium a mandate to negotiate with the european parliament and hopefully achieve a vote in september , after british concerns over the power of such an institution were eased .
" the powers of the european agencies are focused on areas where there is dispute about a point of law , rather than allowing them to become involved in day-to-day supervision or second guessing the discretion of national supervisors , " uk finance minister george osborne said .
britain , home to europe 's biggest financial sector , had insisted that a pan-european body should not interfere with member states ' fiscal sovereignty .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years .

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .
that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .
' fortress europe ' according to the eu 's employment commissioner , laszlo anders , immigrants have tended to be disproportionately over-represented in certain industries , like construction , making them especially vulnerable in the economic downturn .
" it 's important to get rid of stereotypes and fight the assumptions which are not really supported by evidence , " he said .
" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .
it also notes that in some countries there has been an increase in employment rates among immigrant women , who took up extra work after their husbands lost their jobs .
migrants in germany to be promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's malmstom says the 27-nation block needs a long-term migration policy faced with a sharp drop in the number of skilled workers in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's government and the federal labor agency have proposed ways of promoting migrants ' qualifications .
statistics show that the qualifications levels among young people with migration backgrounds are far too low . maria boehmer , the government official responsible for migration , says that too many foreigners are currently employed in jobs below their qualifications .
the cdu politician has announced that she would be proposing draft legislation by the end of the year that would speed up and simplify recognition of foreign academic qualifications . the opposition green party has urged the center-right governing coalition to make it easier for foreigners living in germany to obtain german citizenship . it argues that citizenship tests should be abolished and that it should be generally possible for people becoming germans to retain their original citizenship .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

the un command said in a statement the north 's army representatives requested a delay " for administrative reasons " .
no new time has been set .
a joint team of investigators involving military officers and civilian experts from the south , the united states and sweden in may accused the north of launching a torpedo attack on the south korean warship cheonan , killing 46 sailors .
military officers from north korea and the un command that oversees the korean war truce were to meet at the korean border of panmunjom to discuss the sinking of the ship .
it would have been the first meeting since the sinking on march 26 , which sharply raised tension on the divided korean peninsula .
bildunterschrift : the talks were supposed to take place in the border village of panmunjom diplomatic tussles the north denies it was involved in the sinking and has accused the south of masterminding a fabrication for political gain .
on friday , the un security council in a statement condemned the attack but did not directly blame the north , apparently in a concession to china , a permanent member and north korea 's only ally .
north korea celebrated the statement as a diplomatic victory .
" problems on the korean peninsula can only be resolved through the peaceful methods of talks and negotiation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesperson qin gang told a regular news briefing in beijing on tuesday .

the location has not been decided .
it was originally planned for the yellow sea , but this caused strong protests from china .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .

the un command said in a statement the north 's army representatives requested a delay " for administrative reasons " .
no new time has been set .
a joint team of investigators involving military officers and civilian experts from the south , the united states and sweden in may accused the north of launching a torpedo attack on the south korean warship cheonan , killing 46 sailors .
military officers from north korea and the un command that oversees the korean war truce were to meet at the korean border of panmunjom to discuss the sinking of the ship .
it would have been the first meeting since the sinking on march 26 , which sharply raised tension on the divided korean peninsula .
bildunterschrift : the talks were supposed to take place in the border village of panmunjom diplomatic tussles the north denies it was involved in the sinking and has accused the south of masterminding a fabrication for political gain .
on friday , the un security council in a statement condemned the attack but did not directly blame the north , apparently in a concession to china , a permanent member and north korea 's only ally .
north korea celebrated the statement as a diplomatic victory .
" problems on the korean peninsula can only be resolved through the peaceful methods of talks and negotiation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesperson qin gang told a regular news briefing in beijing on tuesday .
" a war of words , or even using military means , can not fundamentally resolve the issues " .
the two allies us and south korea have planned a naval exercise as a show of strength following the attack in march .
the location has not been decided .
it was originally planned for the yellow sea , but this caused strong protests from china .
observers have pointed out that north korea 's decision to put off the cheonan talks could be related to its dismay about the war games. jb / reuters / afp / ap editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .
that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .
' fortress europe ' according to the eu 's employment commissioner , laszlo anders , immigrants have tended to be disproportionately over-represented in certain industries , like construction , making them especially vulnerable in the economic downturn .
" it 's important to get rid of stereotypes and fight the assumptions which are not really supported by evidence , " he said .
" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .
it also notes that in some countries there has been an increase in employment rates among immigrant women , who took up extra work after their husbands lost their jobs .
migrants in germany to be promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's malmstom says the 27-nation block needs a long-term migration policy faced with a sharp drop in the number of skilled workers in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's government and the federal labor agency have proposed ways of promoting migrants ' qualifications .
statistics show that the qualifications levels among young people with migration backgrounds are far too low . maria boehmer , the government official responsible for migration , says that too many foreigners are currently employed in jobs below their qualifications .
the cdu politician has announced that she would be proposing draft legislation by the end of the year that would speed up and simplify recognition of foreign academic qualifications . the opposition green party has urged the center-right governing coalition to make it easier for foreigners living in germany to obtain german citizenship . it argues that citizenship tests should be abolished and that it should be generally possible for people becoming germans to retain their original citizenship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de south asia -pipe- 13.07.2010 indian , pakistani fms to discuss resuming talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's pm singh , right , shakes hands with pakistan 's pm gilani during their meeting in egypt the foreign ministers of india and pakistan will meet in islamabad on thursday .
the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .
the local traders are looking for around 50-60 items to trade .
and also the traders want to visit each other .
they are looking for a kind of visa that will enable them to travel at least for a year without any restrictions . " both india and pakistan claim kashmir as a whole .
they have fought several wars over the region in the past five decades . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the president 's first state visit to germany 's eastern neighbor . on his first visit to poland as germany 's new president on tuesday , christian wulff met with president-elect bronislaw komorowski and pledged to strengthen polish-german relations . both the new german president and his polish counterpart-to-be spoke about the coincidence that made both of them start their term in office at more or less the same time . wulff was elected on june 30 following the resignation of former president horst koehler in may . komorowski replaces the late president lech kaczynski , who along with his wife and 94 passengers was killed in an air crash in russia in april . the men took the opportunity of their first meeting to look ahead to a new level of cooperation between the two countries . komorowski spoke of the idea of patronage to be extended by both leaders over initiatives aimed at building rapprochement between the two nations . " we attach special attention to youth exchange schemes , " said komorowski .
he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .
the public supports the president-elect 's moves to improve relations with the poland 's closest neighbors , including germany . the specter of german domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff also met with polish prime minister donald tusk observers note that the visit by the new german president coincides with events marking the 600th anniversary of the battle of grunwald , in which polish and lithuanian troops defeated the teutonic knights , a german order of crusaders who made incursions against their neighbours .
this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "
opinion polls reveal that some of the polish electorate is still responsive to xenophobic rhetoric .
the situation is further complicated by the recent presidential campaign , in which the late president 's patriotic agenda and his attachment to history were exploited by his twin brother .
as poland 's two liberal leaders , komorowski and prime minister donald tusk , set out to build new bridges , internal polish politics are still likely to cast a shadow over polish-german relations .

the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice . " so health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine . homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the united kingdom , where the british medical association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the national health service should fund its use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in meissen , saxony scarce scientific evidence for practice nearly all medical officials agree with lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment . " if everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said dr. kay brune , a professor in the department of experimental and clinical pharmacology and toxicology at friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nuernberg , in southern germany . brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the german psyche . " homeopathy has a very long tradition in germany , " he added in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the founder , hahnemann was a brilliant physician .
but at that time doing nothing was helpful to the patient .
in 200 years , the pseudo-science has not taken any steps forward . " he also added that under the third reich , nazi medical officials explored it as a " non-jewish medicine , " and even they gave up on it . other german politicians have since jumped on the bandwagon , including rainer hess of the federal joint committee for doctors and insurers who described the current situation concerning homeopathy as " extremely unsatisfactory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the evidence , many germans still engage in homeopathic practices homeopathy costs are a drop in the bucket brune also said that even if politicians do manage to get rid of it from public insurance , they may be wasting their time because relatively little money is actually spent on homeopathy on an annual basis . " my estimate is 100 million euros -lsb- are spent on homeopathy annually -rsb- , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in germany , " he said . according to germany 's pharmaceutical industry federation -lrb- bpi -rrb- , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros german public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually . in the end though , brune added that because so many germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it . according to a recent study by the allensbach institute , a public opinion research firm in southern germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .

but at that time doing nothing was helpful to the patient .
in 200 years , the pseudo-science has not taken any steps forward . " he also added that under the third reich , nazi medical officials explored it as a " non-jewish medicine , " and even they gave up on it . other german politicians have since jumped on the bandwagon , including rainer hess of the federal joint committee for doctors and insurers who described the current situation concerning homeopathy as " extremely unsatisfactory . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the evidence , many germans still engage in homeopathic practices homeopathy costs are a drop in the bucket brune also said that even if politicians do manage to get rid of it from public insurance , they may be wasting their time because relatively little money is actually spent on homeopathy on an annual basis . " my estimate is 100 million euros -lsb- are spent on homeopathy annually -rsb- , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in germany , " he said . according to germany 's pharmaceutical industry federation -lrb- bpi -rrb- , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros german public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually . in the end though , brune added that because so many germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it . according to a recent study by the allensbach institute , a public opinion research firm in southern germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .
" they will make a compromise and under certain circumstances they will pay for it as they do for acupuncture .
it satisfies the health need at the lowest possible cost . " author : cyrus farivar editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .

" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "

" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .

statistics show that the qualifications levels among young people with migration backgrounds are far too low . maria boehmer , the government official responsible for migration , says that too many foreigners are currently employed in jobs below their qualifications .
the cdu politician has announced that she would be proposing draft legislation by the end of the year that would speed up and simplify recognition of foreign academic qualifications . the opposition green party has urged the center-right governing coalition to make it easier for foreigners living in germany to obtain german citizenship . it argues that citizenship tests should be abolished and that it should be generally possible for people becoming germans to retain their original citizenship .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .
purchased at the same auction , the gallery actually paid more for the inferior imitation than for the genuine botticelli . author : dany mitzman -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .
purchased at the same auction , the gallery actually paid more for the inferior imitation than for the genuine botticelli . author : dany mitzman -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .
the local traders are looking for around 50-60 items to trade .
and also the traders want to visit each other .
they are looking for a kind of visa that will enable them to travel at least for a year without any restrictions . " both india and pakistan claim kashmir as a whole .
they have fought several wars over the region in the past five decades . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice . " so health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine . homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the united kingdom , where the british medical association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the national health service should fund its use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in meissen , saxony scarce scientific evidence for practice nearly all medical officials agree with lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment . " if everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said dr. kay brune , a professor in the department of experimental and clinical pharmacology and toxicology at friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nuernberg , in southern germany . brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the german psyche . " homeopathy has a very long tradition in germany , " he added in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the founder , hahnemann was a brilliant physician .
but at that time doing nothing was helpful to the patient .
in 200 years , the pseudo-science has not taken any steps forward . " he also added that under the third reich , nazi medical officials explored it as a " non-jewish medicine , " and even they gave up on it . other german politicians have since jumped on the bandwagon , including rainer hess of the federal joint committee for doctors and insurers who described the current situation concerning homeopathy as " extremely unsatisfactory .

it wants to devolve power to national governments , but it seems to have upset both gm proponents and detractors alike . in an unprecedented step to hand european union powers back to member states , the bloc 's executive - the european commission - has drafted plans to give countries the freedom to decide for themselves whether to grow or ban genetically modified crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european health commissioner john dalli says the executive is neutral the move is the result of frustration over years of deadlock over introducing the technology into the eu . the proposal would enable member states to prohibit the cultivation of gm crops that have already been scientifically approved , using economic , social and ethical reasons as the justification for the bans . countries would have the power to prohibit cultivating the crops on all or part of their territories . under the current system , gm crop applications are examined by a panel of experts from eu states and need to pass with a qualified majority .
in the case of a deadlock , the decision goes to eu ministers and if an impasse persists , the european commission is left with the final decision . to date , only two varieties of gm crops have been approved in the bloc , compared to around 150 world-wide . more legal disputes ? opponents of genetically modified food are worried that biotech companies will take advantage of the new proposal to force more of their products into the union . " any country wanting to ban gm crops under these proposals will open themselves up to legal challenges from the biotech corporations who want to force gm crops into europe , " said mute schimpf , food campaigner for environmental group friends of the earth europe . the uk-based organization gm freeze warned that members of the eu opposed to gm crops could be exposed to fresh trade complaints , which would be difficult to defend against . " member states should approach the commission 's proposals claiming to facilitate bans on gm crops with extreme caution , " said pete riley , campaigns director at gm freeze . " they need to ensure that in the short and long term that they will be able to ban a gm crop without ending up in court or with a wto dispute . " riley said he was n't categorically opposed to the proposal . allowing member states the right to make the final decision on gm crops is " the right thing to do , " he said , but he is concerned that what is on the table " appears to be subject to last minute changes .

it wants to devolve power to national governments , but it seems to have upset both gm proponents and detractors alike . in an unprecedented step to hand european union powers back to member states , the bloc 's executive - the european commission - has drafted plans to give countries the freedom to decide for themselves whether to grow or ban genetically modified crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european health commissioner john dalli says the executive is neutral the move is the result of frustration over years of deadlock over introducing the technology into the eu . the proposal would enable member states to prohibit the cultivation of gm crops that have already been scientifically approved , using economic , social and ethical reasons as the justification for the bans . countries would have the power to prohibit cultivating the crops on all or part of their territories . under the current system , gm crop applications are examined by a panel of experts from eu states and need to pass with a qualified majority .
in the case of a deadlock , the decision goes to eu ministers and if an impasse persists , the european commission is left with the final decision . to date , only two varieties of gm crops have been approved in the bloc , compared to around 150 world-wide . more legal disputes ? opponents of genetically modified food are worried that biotech companies will take advantage of the new proposal to force more of their products into the union . " any country wanting to ban gm crops under these proposals will open themselves up to legal challenges from the biotech corporations who want to force gm crops into europe , " said mute schimpf , food campaigner for environmental group friends of the earth europe . the uk-based organization gm freeze warned that members of the eu opposed to gm crops could be exposed to fresh trade complaints , which would be difficult to defend against . " member states should approach the commission 's proposals claiming to facilitate bans on gm crops with extreme caution , " said pete riley , campaigns director at gm freeze . " they need to ensure that in the short and long term that they will be able to ban a gm crop without ending up in court or with a wto dispute . " riley said he was n't categorically opposed to the proposal . allowing member states the right to make the final decision on gm crops is " the right thing to do , " he said , but he is concerned that what is on the table " appears to be subject to last minute changes .

" the desire is to do it in the most transparent way possible , including by presenting the exposure of different institutions to sovereign debt , " belgian finance minister didier reynders , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told a news conference .
while france questions the need to fully publish exposure to sovereign debt and stressed the difficulty of establishing a harmonized tier one - or capital - ratio for european banks , germany , spain and britain are in favor of full disclosure , according to the reuters news agency , quoting unnamed sources .

according to a study by pricewaterhousecoopers , german banks had the highest number of bad loans on their books at the end of 2009 , amounting to over 212 billion euros -lrb- $ 269 -rrb- .
doubts over banks ' abilities to clean up their balance sheets have hampered efforts to raise funding and made them dependent on liquidity provided by the european central bank in the wake of the global financial crisis .

" the powers of the european agencies are focused on areas where there is dispute about a point of law , rather than allowing them to become involved in day-to-day supervision or second guessing the discretion of national supervisors , " uk finance minister george osborne said .
britain , home to europe 's biggest financial sector , had insisted that a pan-european body should not interfere with member states ' fiscal sovereignty .

avoiding bankruptcy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the eu is prepared if banks fail the stress tests eu ministers agreed that any bank pushed to the brink of collapse would be eligible for a state bailout , but with strict conditions attached .
" first , an institution which is in trouble should raise capital on the markets .
if this does not work , the state should help .
if the state is not in a position to do it ... the state can turn to the -lsb- rescue system -rsb- , but only under the conditions which the rules impose , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on tuesday .
some german and spanish banks are seen as the weakest links in the european banking system .
according to a study by pricewaterhousecoopers , german banks had the highest number of bad loans on their books at the end of 2009 , amounting to over 212 billion euros -lrb- $ 269 -rrb- .
doubts over banks ' abilities to clean up their balance sheets have hampered efforts to raise funding and made them dependent on liquidity provided by the european central bank in the wake of the global financial crisis .

ministers handed belgium a mandate to negotiate with the european parliament and hopefully achieve a vote in september , after british concerns over the power of such an institution were eased .
" the powers of the european agencies are focused on areas where there is dispute about a point of law , rather than allowing them to become involved in day-to-day supervision or second guessing the discretion of national supervisors , " uk finance minister george osborne said .
britain , home to europe 's biggest financial sector , had insisted that a pan-european body should not interfere with member states ' fiscal sovereignty .

there were 335 votes for the bill and just one against .
" passing this bill against concealing your face is a success on two fronts , " france 's justice minister michele alliot-marie said on tuesday .
" first of all , it 's a great success for democracy , which has been strengthened by a good quality debate in parliament .
secondly , it 's a success for the french republic and the values it stands for , " she added .
while center-right parties like president nicholas sarkozy 's ump party and the nouveau centre party voted for the bill , most members of the opposition socialist , communist and green parties refused to take part , because they fear it may go against the constitution .
controversial bill with five million muslims , france is home to europe 's largest muslim community .
if the bill is signed into law , wearing the burqa or the niqab will incur a fine of 150 euros -lrb- $ 189 -rrb- .
the main body representing muslims in france , the french council of the muslim faith -lrb- cfcm -rrb- , has deplored the ban insisting that it stigmatizes the whole of islam , when only about 2,000 women actually wear such a veil .
the law must still be approved by france 's upper house , the senate , in september .
it will then have to go to france 's constitutional council for a review .
france is the second european country to move towards a ban of full-face veils after belgium 's lower house of parliament voted in april to ban all clothing that covers or partially covers the face .

the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice . " so health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine . homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the united kingdom , where the british medical association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the national health service should fund its use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in meissen , saxony scarce scientific evidence for practice nearly all medical officials agree with lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment . " if everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said dr. kay brune , a professor in the department of experimental and clinical pharmacology and toxicology at friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nuernberg , in southern germany . brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the german psyche . " homeopathy has a very long tradition in germany , " he added in an interview with deutsche welle .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the evidence , many germans still engage in homeopathic practices homeopathy costs are a drop in the bucket brune also said that even if politicians do manage to get rid of it from public insurance , they may be wasting their time because relatively little money is actually spent on homeopathy on an annual basis . " my estimate is 100 million euros -lsb- are spent on homeopathy annually -rsb- , which is a trifle compared to the overall health costs in germany , " he said . according to germany 's pharmaceutical industry federation -lrb- bpi -rrb- , public medical insurance companies spent only eight million euros on homeopathic medicine , which is quite small compared to the 30 billion euros german public medical insurance companies spend on conventional medicine annually . in the end though , brune added that because so many germans take advantage of homeopathy it will be hard to gather enough political will to stop it . according to a recent study by the allensbach institute , a public opinion research firm in southern germany , the use of homeopathy is on the rise .
in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .

it was the president 's first state visit to germany 's eastern neighbor . on his first visit to poland as germany 's new president on tuesday , christian wulff met with president-elect bronislaw komorowski and pledged to strengthen polish-german relations . both the new german president and his polish counterpart-to-be spoke about the coincidence that made both of them start their term in office at more or less the same time . wulff was elected on june 30 following the resignation of former president horst koehler in may . komorowski replaces the late president lech kaczynski , who along with his wife and 94 passengers was killed in an air crash in russia in april . the men took the opportunity of their first meeting to look ahead to a new level of cooperation between the two countries . komorowski spoke of the idea of patronage to be extended by both leaders over initiatives aimed at building rapprochement between the two nations . " we attach special attention to youth exchange schemes , " said komorowski .
he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .
the public supports the president-elect 's moves to improve relations with the poland 's closest neighbors , including germany . the specter of german domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff also met with polish prime minister donald tusk observers note that the visit by the new german president coincides with events marking the 600th anniversary of the battle of grunwald , in which polish and lithuanian troops defeated the teutonic knights , a german order of crusaders who made incursions against their neighbours .
this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "
opinion polls reveal that some of the polish electorate is still responsive to xenophobic rhetoric .
the situation is further complicated by the recent presidential campaign , in which the late president 's patriotic agenda and his attachment to history were exploited by his twin brother .
as poland 's two liberal leaders , komorowski and prime minister donald tusk , set out to build new bridges , internal polish politics are still likely to cast a shadow over polish-german relations .

the un command said in a statement the north 's army representatives requested a delay " for administrative reasons " .
no new time has been set .
a joint team of investigators involving military officers and civilian experts from the south , the united states and sweden in may accused the north of launching a torpedo attack on the south korean warship cheonan , killing 46 sailors .
military officers from north korea and the un command that oversees the korean war truce were to meet at the korean border of panmunjom to discuss the sinking of the ship .
it would have been the first meeting since the sinking on march 26 , which sharply raised tension on the divided korean peninsula .
bildunterschrift : the talks were supposed to take place in the border village of panmunjom diplomatic tussles the north denies it was involved in the sinking and has accused the south of masterminding a fabrication for political gain .
on friday , the un security council in a statement condemned the attack but did not directly blame the north , apparently in a concession to china , a permanent member and north korea 's only ally .
north korea celebrated the statement as a diplomatic victory .
" problems on the korean peninsula can only be resolved through the peaceful methods of talks and negotiation , " chinese foreign ministry spokesperson qin gang told a regular news briefing in beijing on tuesday .
" a war of words , or even using military means , can not fundamentally resolve the issues " .
the two allies us and south korea have planned a naval exercise as a show of strength following the attack in march .
the location has not been decided .
it was originally planned for the yellow sea , but this caused strong protests from china .
observers have pointed out that north korea 's decision to put off the cheonan talks could be related to its dismay about the war games. jb / reuters / afp / ap editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the president 's first state visit to germany 's eastern neighbor . on his first visit to poland as germany 's new president on tuesday , christian wulff met with president-elect bronislaw komorowski and pledged to strengthen polish-german relations . both the new german president and his polish counterpart-to-be spoke about the coincidence that made both of them start their term in office at more or less the same time . wulff was elected on june 30 following the resignation of former president horst koehler in may . komorowski replaces the late president lech kaczynski , who along with his wife and 94 passengers was killed in an air crash in russia in april . the men took the opportunity of their first meeting to look ahead to a new level of cooperation between the two countries . komorowski spoke of the idea of patronage to be extended by both leaders over initiatives aimed at building rapprochement between the two nations . " we attach special attention to youth exchange schemes , " said komorowski .
he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .
the public supports the president-elect 's moves to improve relations with the poland 's closest neighbors , including germany . the specter of german domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff also met with polish prime minister donald tusk observers note that the visit by the new german president coincides with events marking the 600th anniversary of the battle of grunwald , in which polish and lithuanian troops defeated the teutonic knights , a german order of crusaders who made incursions against their neighbours .
this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de south asia -pipe- 13.07.2010 indian , pakistani fms to discuss resuming talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's pm singh , right , shakes hands with pakistan 's pm gilani during their meeting in egypt the foreign ministers of india and pakistan will meet in islamabad on thursday .
the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .
the local traders are looking for around 50-60 items to trade .

but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .
the local traders are looking for around 50-60 items to trade .
and also the traders want to visit each other .

now , he can relax and retire in his aquarium in oberhausen , in northern germany .
a village in spain , however , would like to give him a new home . for weeks during the world cup , long lines formed in front of the sea life aquarium in oberhausen despite the summer heat , with people waiting patiently to enter the park .
an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .
and paul is an attraction .
paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .
two years ago , during the european football championship , paul gave the first samples of his abilities as an oracle .
how does he do it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul correctly picked the winner of all of germany 's matches paul loves mussels . during the 2008 tournament , someone came up with the idea to take two glass containers , drape each with the flag of one of the competing teams , and place a mussel inside .

one explanation : the color combination .
maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .
but even in this case , the prediction 's concurrence with the actual outcome of the match leaves too much room for coincidence .

it wants to devolve power to national governments , but it seems to have upset both gm proponents and detractors alike . in an unprecedented step to hand european union powers back to member states , the bloc 's executive - the european commission - has drafted plans to give countries the freedom to decide for themselves whether to grow or ban genetically modified crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european health commissioner john dalli says the executive is neutral the move is the result of frustration over years of deadlock over introducing the technology into the eu . the proposal would enable member states to prohibit the cultivation of gm crops that have already been scientifically approved , using economic , social and ethical reasons as the justification for the bans . countries would have the power to prohibit cultivating the crops on all or part of their territories . under the current system , gm crop applications are examined by a panel of experts from eu states and need to pass with a qualified majority .
in the case of a deadlock , the decision goes to eu ministers and if an impasse persists , the european commission is left with the final decision . to date , only two varieties of gm crops have been approved in the bloc , compared to around 150 world-wide . more legal disputes ? opponents of genetically modified food are worried that biotech companies will take advantage of the new proposal to force more of their products into the union . " any country wanting to ban gm crops under these proposals will open themselves up to legal challenges from the biotech corporations who want to force gm crops into europe , " said mute schimpf , food campaigner for environmental group friends of the earth europe . the uk-based organization gm freeze warned that members of the eu opposed to gm crops could be exposed to fresh trade complaints , which would be difficult to defend against . " member states should approach the commission 's proposals claiming to facilitate bans on gm crops with extreme caution , " said pete riley , campaigns director at gm freeze . " they need to ensure that in the short and long term that they will be able to ban a gm crop without ending up in court or with a wto dispute . " riley said he was n't categorically opposed to the proposal . allowing member states the right to make the final decision on gm crops is " the right thing to do , " he said , but he is concerned that what is on the table " appears to be subject to last minute changes . " biotech disappointment however , far from celebrating a business opportunity , some biotech proponents are expressing concerns about the prospects of more – not fewer – legal battles in future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in early 2010 , the eu authorized the cultivation of the genetically modified amflora potato " our fear is that it -lrb- the proposal -rrb- will be misused by governments to ban products indiscriminately , " carel du marchie sarvaas - from the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- - told deutsche welle . " we are science-based people , so when we hear politicians say that it 's ok to ban something for political reasons , we find that hard to live with . " " you 're going to have different rules in different eu countries , " said julian little , spokesman for german biotech firm bayer cropscience . " it 's just inviting legal disputes , and the lawyers are going to love it . " farming perspective farmers are also unimpressed . copa-cogeca - an organization representing farmers and agricultural cooperatives in the eu - is worried that differing rules between european countries would jeopardize the eu 's internal market and distort competition between the bloc 's farmers .

an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .

paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .

maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de south asia -pipe- 13.07.2010 indian , pakistani fms to discuss resuming talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india 's pm singh , right , shakes hands with pakistan 's pm gilani during their meeting in egypt the foreign ministers of india and pakistan will meet in islamabad on thursday .
the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .

and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .
the local traders are looking for around 50-60 items to trade .
and also the traders want to visit each other .
they are looking for a kind of visa that will enable them to travel at least for a year without any restrictions . " both india and pakistan claim kashmir as a whole .

the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .

it was the president 's first state visit to germany 's eastern neighbor . on his first visit to poland as germany 's new president on tuesday , christian wulff met with president-elect bronislaw komorowski and pledged to strengthen polish-german relations . both the new german president and his polish counterpart-to-be spoke about the coincidence that made both of them start their term in office at more or less the same time . wulff was elected on june 30 following the resignation of former president horst koehler in may . komorowski replaces the late president lech kaczynski , who along with his wife and 94 passengers was killed in an air crash in russia in april . the men took the opportunity of their first meeting to look ahead to a new level of cooperation between the two countries . komorowski spoke of the idea of patronage to be extended by both leaders over initiatives aimed at building rapprochement between the two nations . " we attach special attention to youth exchange schemes , " said komorowski .
he noted that a conference of the two countries ' intellectuals was planned to take place in krzyzowa , the symbolic place of reconciliation between the two nations in the early 1990s . " the conference will serve to seek new ways of addressing european societies , notably the younger generation , " he said . an appeal for stepped up european integration wulff spoke about the importance of polish relations with his country .
" polish-german relations are of great significance , because germany bears a historical responsibility , which it is ready to meet , " he said .
" we owe the unity of germany to the polish solidarity movement .
we intend to work together for further european integration . " wulff was full of praise for what he described as poland 's ability to transform the idea of solidarity into solid economic foundations that have made the country the envy of europe . this spirit of openness is welcome news in the streets of warsaw .
the public supports the president-elect 's moves to improve relations with the poland 's closest neighbors , including germany . the specter of german domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff also met with polish prime minister donald tusk observers note that the visit by the new german president coincides with events marking the 600th anniversary of the battle of grunwald , in which polish and lithuanian troops defeated the teutonic knights , a german order of crusaders who made incursions against their neighbours .
this was one of the crucial battles of the late middle ages , held up under communism as a symbol of east european nations teaming up to fight a perceived german encroachment . but to many poles of the younger generation , the ceremonies - including a reenactment of the battle by knights dressed in medieval armor - are just that .
yet older politicians , like nationalist opposition leader jaroslaw kaczynski , who narrowly lost the presidential election earlier this month , continue to play on old sentiments .
kaczynski , twin brother of the late president , has frequently raised the specter of german domination in the past .
old sentiments prevail andrzej jonas , editor of the warsaw voice magazine , told deutsche welle that kaczynski was likely to play the german card once again in next year 's general elections .
" this way of acting is recognized in poland by many populists as a very fruitful way to awaken old ghosts , " he said . " obviously , there 's a danger to the polish mentality and to relations between poland and the rest of europe , mainly germany , but unfortunately it is used for primitive political purposes . "
opinion polls reveal that some of the polish electorate is still responsive to xenophobic rhetoric .
the situation is further complicated by the recent presidential campaign , in which the late president 's patriotic agenda and his attachment to history were exploited by his twin brother .
as poland 's two liberal leaders , komorowski and prime minister donald tusk , set out to build new bridges , internal polish politics are still likely to cast a shadow over polish-german relations .

but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .
the local traders are looking for around 50-60 items to trade .
and also the traders want to visit each other .
they are looking for a kind of visa that will enable them to travel at least for a year without any restrictions . " both india and pakistan claim kashmir as a whole .
they have fought several wars over the region in the past five decades . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .
" and there is also the very obvious recommendation that you should have every able single hand on deck , as the marines say . " the oecd is trying to persuade national governments that immigration is essential for their economies , because additional workers are needed to maintain growth and prosperity .
migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : future generations should be allowed to reach full potential another proposal is to get companies outside the eu to transfer specialized employees for short stints .
that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .
' fortress europe ' according to the eu 's employment commissioner , laszlo anders , immigrants have tended to be disproportionately over-represented in certain industries , like construction , making them especially vulnerable in the economic downturn .
" it 's important to get rid of stereotypes and fight the assumptions which are not really supported by evidence , " he said .
" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .
it also notes that in some countries there has been an increase in employment rates among immigrant women , who took up extra work after their husbands lost their jobs .
migrants in germany to be promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's malmstom says the 27-nation block needs a long-term migration policy faced with a sharp drop in the number of skilled workers in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's government and the federal labor agency have proposed ways of promoting migrants ' qualifications .
statistics show that the qualifications levels among young people with migration backgrounds are far too low . maria boehmer , the government official responsible for migration , says that too many foreigners are currently employed in jobs below their qualifications .
the cdu politician has announced that she would be proposing draft legislation by the end of the year that would speed up and simplify recognition of foreign academic qualifications . the opposition green party has urged the center-right governing coalition to make it easier for foreigners living in germany to obtain german citizenship . it argues that citizenship tests should be abolished and that it should be generally possible for people becoming germans to retain their original citizenship .

the united kingdom may also do the same . in recent days , the over-two-centuries-old practice of homeopathy has come under fire in germany . dr. karl lauterbach , the chair of the parliamentary health committee , recently called for public health insurers to stop funding the practice , which typically involves solutions of small amounts of herbs or other medicines heavily diluted with water and then shaken or stirred to " add energy " to the solution . according to its proponents , homeopathy can heal patients as well - if not better - than conventional medicine , while its detractors , including nearly all medical doctors and scientists , say that it is no more powerful than a placebo . homeopathy was first proposed by the german physician samuel hahnemann in the late 18th century , and today is covered by over two-thirds of public health insurance in germany . in an interview with the magazine der spiegel , lauterbach , who himself is a medical doctor and an adjunct professor of health policy at harvard university in the united states , said many patients believe insurance only pays for things that are proven to help , and therefore it is in the public interest to stop the practice . " so health insurers are dignifying homeopaths through their actions , " he told the magazine . homeopathy has also faced similar challenges in the united kingdom , where the british medical association and a parliamentary committee have raised serious questions as to whether the national health service should fund its use . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hahnemann , the father of homeopathy , was born in meissen , saxony scarce scientific evidence for practice nearly all medical officials agree with lauterbach 's assessment , and say that while homeopathy should be allowed to exist , the public should not be forced to fund a dubious medical treatment . " if everybody pays for his beer , then he can pay for his homeopathy , " said dr. kay brune , a professor in the department of experimental and clinical pharmacology and toxicology at friedrich-alexander university erlangen-nuernberg , in southern germany . brune added that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that homeopathy actually causes any meaningful and healing bio-chemical reactions in patients , but that does n't stop people from believing in a practice that has been so deeply ingrained into the german psyche .

in 1970 , only one in four west germans had ever used homeopathic remedies - a figure that has since risen to 57 percent . " i think the politicians are unable to tell the public that this is garbage , " brune said .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 13.07.2010 bp claims ' significant progress ' in battle to cap oil well großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp confirms a well cap is in place to stem flow of oil from ruptured pipeline thirteen weeks after the oil catastrophe in the gulf of mexico , bp says it has successfully installed a cap to stop of the flow of oil into the sea .
tests on tuesday will determine if the oil spill has been stopped . " we have made significant progress .
this could lead to the shutting of the well , " admiral thad allen , head of the us government response effort , told the nbc television network on monday .
he was referring to the latest attempt to halt the massive oil slick in the gulf of mexico - which is still spewing vast amounts of crude into the ocean every day - by using underwater robots to install a new cap over the ruptured well .
" this containment cap will have the ability to actually close down valves and slowly contain all the oil , " allen said in another interview with news network cnn .
he said it will be possible to see how much pressure is in the well which will help determine whether or not its possible to shut the well for a period of time " , allen said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : admiral thad allen , head of response effort , says progress is at hand " that could lead to one or two positive outcomes , " he continued .
" it could tell us that the well is withholding the pressure and we can shut it or just cap it , if you will .
either way those are two pretty good outcomes . "
the latest in a series of attempts to contain the spill comes 13 weeks after the deepwater horizon explosion that triggered the worst environmental disaster in american history .
thus far response efforts have been patchy , with energy giant bp managing little more than a partial mop-up .
the us government estimates that some 60,000 barrels of oil are flowing out of the ruptured pipe every day .
of that , less than half is currently being captured .
by july 10 , only 749,000 barrels had been collected or burned off by containment systems .
' planned and practised ' the latest operation entails the removal of the ineffective existing cap and its replacement with something called a transition spool .
once that has been bolted onto the pipe , a huge oil-collecting funnel , dubbed the " top hat 10 " can be put in place to start capturing oil .
bildunterschrift : damage done off the coast of louisiana kent wells , bp 's vice president , told reporters he was optimistic they 'd got it right this time .
" we are pleased with our progress , " he said .
" we have carefully planned and practised this whole procedure .
we 've tried to work out as many of the bugs as we can . "
in addition to the new system , which should give the first reliable indication of the overall flow , a new containment ship has been deployed to the area . bp is confident that the combination of the two will stop the previously unstoppable .
the vessel , called the helix producer , was originally due to be on its way by sunday , but was delayed until monday for technical reasons .
temporary measure in conjunction with the new cap , the helix producer ought to raise capture capacity from a current 25,000 barrels a day to as much as 80,000 barrels a day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even the supertankers have not cleared up as much as necessary white house spokesman robert gibbs told nbc that efforts to stem the flow of crude had reached a critical stage .
" the new containment procedure will more than triple our capacity , " he said .
but even if it does prove successful , it is still only a temporary measure .
a long-term solution is not expected until the middle of august , when drilling of the first of two relief wells is expected to be finished .
that work was suspended on saturday in order for the robots to remove the old cap , but in a statement released on saturday , bp said the time frame was realistic .
" although uncertainty still exists , the first half of august remains the current estimate of the most likely date by which the first relief well will be completed and kill operations performed , " bp said .
picking up the tab bp says that while it is too early to put a number on the overall cost of the disaster , it has so far cost the cash-rich company a massive 2.78 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
that includes the cost of containment , relief well drilling , grants to the gulf states , federal costs and claims paid .
bildunterschrift : livelihoods have been crushed by the oil contamination on saturday , the british energy giant said it had received 105,000 claims and had made more than 52,000 payments thus far .
but with so much still outstanding , speculation about bp 's next move is rife .
british and us newspapers reported on monday that the beleaguered oil company was in talks to sell 9.5 billion euros of assets in order to create a more substantial disaster fund .
there is also much talk about bp becoming the target of a hostile takeover bid from us rival , exxon .
neither company has commented on the reports , but the mere possibility helped push share prices up by 6 percent in london on monday .
meanwhile , the obama administration has announced that it is imposing a new moratorium on deep-water offshore drilling , citing new evidence of safety concerns following the deepwater horizion oil spill in the gulf of mexico .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .
the three parties won 118 seats in the 200-seat lower house in late may , giving them the largest majority since the breakup of czechoslovakia in 1992 .
parliament must rubberstamp the new government within the next 30 days .
a budget for tough times bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for czech politicians , the euro is looking less attractive the first task of the new government will be to draw up a 2011 draft budget .
the new leaders hope to reduce the planned 2010 deficit of 5.3 percent of gross domestic product to below the eu-mandated ceiling of 3 percent .
government debt is on the rise , but the coalition agreement promises not to raise taxes but instead enact sweeping cuts .
the parties have agreed to cut wages in the government sector , as well as make cuts to housing construction subsidies , unemployment benefits and maternity leave .
the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .

migration boosts economies the eu 's home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstrom , said governments needed to acknowledge how important labor migration is .
" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .
and this will not be satisfied only through eu nationals , " she said .
" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "
the oecd says the economic crisis has left many migrants exposed and vulnerable .
the european commission has proposed new legislation to protect seasonal workers , saying low-skilled workers coming to europe are often exploited .

that way european companies would benefit from attracting highly-skilled professionals with few strings attached .
' fortress europe ' according to the eu 's employment commissioner , laszlo anders , immigrants have tended to be disproportionately over-represented in certain industries , like construction , making them especially vulnerable in the economic downturn .
" it 's important to get rid of stereotypes and fight the assumptions which are not really supported by evidence , " he said .
" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .
it also notes that in some countries there has been an increase in employment rates among immigrant women , who took up extra work after their husbands lost their jobs .

statistics show that the qualifications levels among young people with migration backgrounds are far too low . maria boehmer , the government official responsible for migration , says that too many foreigners are currently employed in jobs below their qualifications .
the cdu politician has announced that she would be proposing draft legislation by the end of the year that would speed up and simplify recognition of foreign academic qualifications . the opposition green party has urged the center-right governing coalition to make it easier for foreigners living in germany to obtain german citizenship . it argues that citizenship tests should be abolished and that it should be generally possible for people becoming germans to retain their original citizenship .

the three-party coalition , led by prime minister petr necas , has pledged to cut the deficit and fight corruption . czech president vaclav klaus officially appointed a new government for his country on tuesday .
headed up by prime minister petr necas , the government is a coalition made up of the civic democratic party , the country 's main conservative party , the conservative top 09 and the centrist public affairs party .
a coalition agreement was signed on monday that set out plans to fight corruption , reduce the deficit and overhaul the healthcare and pension system in the czech republic .
the appointment ends more than a year of political limbo , the longest the country has gone without a proper cabinet . necas and the new 14-member cabinet took over immediately from jan fischer , who had led the country as a caretaker prime minister since the previous center-right government collapsed in march 2009 .

the government did say it will raise the value-added tax and taxes on lotteries , betting and gambling .
healthcare costs are also set to rise and the government would like to introduce a university tuition fee .
the coalition agreement did not establish a target date for the adoption of the euro currency , saying such a date would only be set " if the common european currency develops as a meaningful and sustainable project . "

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "
global approach needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german halligen islands in the north sea could completely disappear indeed , climate change also threatens the industrialized world .
the southern us state of louisiana is regularly hit by increasingly violent tropical storms that trigger floods .
the halligen islands , off the german coast in the north sea , are known to be submerged several times each year .
but now due to rising sea levels , high waves threaten to completely submerge the islands .
the only difference is that germany and the us have the means to counter climate change .
the maldives are trying a different tack .
they aim to become the first carbon-neutral country in the world by 2019 .
a wind park is already under construction .
that alone wo n't save the islands , but it 's hoped that it will lead to a rethink .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .
using dendrochronology - a tree-ring dating technique - the museum experts were able to determine that the work , painted on an oak panel , was completed after holbein 's death in 1543 . in addition to tree-ring dating , ashok roy 's department uses a variety of modern methods and tools illustrated and explained in the exhibition .
they include pigment analysis , done on tiny samples using a scanning-electron microscope , infrared reflectography to detect carbon underdrawings , and ultraviolet and x-radiography which can reveal losses and changes to a painting . sometimes these techniques can turn up unexpected secrets hidden in the layers beneath the surface . bildunterschrift : dating the paint itself often gives the art experts clues to the real age of a painting aged paint difficult to imitate with such advances in scientific analysis , deliberate forgery of the old masters is understandably on the decrease , but roy said there are still people who can make pretty convincing fakes - on the surface , at least . " what 's very hard to do is to make them convincing under the surface , to use all the right materials and right techniques , " he said .
" and , in fact , it is impossible to age paint artificially so it ends up in its exact chemical composition as paint that has aged over 300 to 400 years . " " close examination " also offers visitors a confession to one of the gallery ’ s greatest misjudgements : sandro botticelli 's " venus and mars " is displayed next to a similar work of the same era , originally also thought to be his .

an exhibition in london reveals the experts ' detective techniques - and some of the fakes they 've been fooled by . the first major exhibition of its kind , " close examination : fakes , mistakes and discoveries " gives visitors a unique , behind-the-scenes view of the work done by the london national gallery 's team of scientists , conservators and art historians . running through september 12 , the free exhibition unveils some of the secrets of how to spot a forgery , displays some unexpected discoveries , and reveals how even the gallery 's greatest art experts have been duped . " we do research on the collection in a continuous way and we think the public may be interested in that research , to learn more about their own collection and to have some of the questions and issues exposed , " said ashok roy , the national gallery 's director of scientific research .
" we thought this was a good moment to look across the whole collection and bring out some of the more interesting case studies that we 've looked at over the last 20 years . " the truth is in the details the national gallery 's scientific department was founded in 1934 and has become a world leader in the study of materials and techniques of western european paintings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this forgery is a 20th-century remake of a renaissance masterpiece the first room of the exhibition is called " deception and deceit " and contains two fakes which are part of the national gallery 's collection , explained roy , who has worked at the museum for 33 years and is also a curator of the exhibition . one of the two counterfeit paintings has been identified as the work of an unknown early-20th-century forger .
it 's an ingenious fake which had the gallery 's experts fooled until a combination of historical and scientific analyses revealed the truth . " the picture was bought in the 1920 's .
in the 1960 's a costume expert looked at the picture , there were already doubts , " said roy .
" and they pointed out that the clothes worn by the group really were designs from 1910 so had nothing to do with renaissance italy .
we 've done a good deal of chemical analysis of the picture and that 's told us there are materials which were n't available to painters in the 15th century - in fact , most of the pigments are 19th-century pigments . " museum experts also discovered that the painting had an unusual varnish , made of a material called shellac which was used for furniture in the 19th century .
with age , the material becomes yellowed and dark . " what we think was done by the person who created this picture was to apply it to the paint so when it dried it began to shrink and that pulled the paint into a sort of cracking pattern which simulated age on the paint surface , " explained roy . science meets art " close examination " is n't just about how the gallery can spot a fake , it also demonstrates how today 's scientific methods can be used to reveal mistakes and make important discoveries .
one of the paintings on display was originally bought as a work by the german artist , hans holbein , the younger . at that time , the national gallery did n't own any works by holbein and were particularly interested in acquiring one , which is why , speculated roy , the authenticity of the work was n't thoroughly examined .

it 's feared that entire island states could be lost to the sea .
but now a few are trying to reverse the tide . for centuries , the stories of the lost cities of atlantis and the lesser-known rungholt – a city on an island in the north sea , swept beneath the waves in 1362 – have been two of the western world 's favorite legends .
but those chilling stories are now becoming reality as rising sea levels threaten to submerge islands around the world .
at particular risk are low-lying islands – flat islands with hardly any elevation .
the maldives , southwest of sri lanka in the indian ocean , are a case in point .
the highest spot on the nearly 2,000 small islands that make up the maldives lies just 2.4 meters above sea level .
and if the waters rise , as several reports predict , many islands would be rendered uninhabitable .
" the fiji islands -lsb- in the south pacific -rsb- have a highland where inhabitants can retreat to if things become tight , " ali rilwan , co-founder of the maldivian non-governmental organization bluepeace said .
" we maldivians , on the other hand , have to come up with something else . "
forecasts by the united nations and intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- give the maldives about a 100 years before they sink into the indian ocean .
bildunterschrift : the maldives ' capital male is protected by a high wall long-term solutions do n't come cheap the growing threat has prompted varied reactions from the affected countries .
many residents of the island of tuvalu in the pacific have already immigrated to new zealand , while the maldives has erected a three-meter-high wall around its capital , male , with the help of japanese funds .
but that highlights another problem that small islands nations often face – a lack of money to equip themselves against rising sea levels and waves .
" walls are n't enough .
we need long-term solutions – one could be to heap up the land to make it higher .
there are technologies to do it but we unfortunately ca n't afford it , " rilwan said .
like many other island inhabitants , the people of the maldives are worried about becoming climate refugees .
president mohamed nasheed has been saving state funds to buy land in india , sri lanka or australia where the maldivians could find new homes in the worst case scenario .
but that 's easier said than done .
india is struggling with an explosion in its population and australia has strict immigration laws .
but the biggest problem that the maldives faces is a lack of a robust economy to generate enough funds to help it fight climate change .
ticking time bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuvalu is another island paradise at risk one possible solution , admittedly a futuristic one , suggested by japan involves the construction of flat , green swimming islands with a radius of three kilometers .
the concept is being developed by japanese construction company shimizu , which is know for its visionary projects .
it 's called " green float " and the company envisages the modern-day noah 's ark to become a new homeland for island residents .
a year ago , the company presented the blueprint to a few representatives of small island states .
" despite the fact that our land is disappearing i 'm still very hopeful , " anote tong , president of kiribati , an island republic that includes several islands in micronesia and polynesia , and is predicted to be one of the first to be submerged .
but it 's not clear whether the japanese-built noah 's ark will be completed on time .
construction is estimated to begin between 2025 and 2050 .
joining forces against the crisis another drawback of the island states ' weak economies is that it 's difficult for them to draw attention to their plight on the political world stage .
that 's why 42 of the small states have joined forces in the alliance of small island states -lrb- aosis -rrb- .
they are demanding support from the rich industrialized nations in the fight against climate change and curbing carbon emissions .
" countries such as tuvalu or nauru have n't contributed at all to climate change but they 're the ones who are the hardest hit , " lino briguglio of the ipcc said .
according to aosis , the consequences of climate change are also impacting development in the largely poor island nations .
for instance , a large part of their infrastructure and economy , mostly tourism and fishing , is concentrated in coastal regions which are in turn affected the most by climate change .
in the long-term , the only option is to halt or at least slow the pace of climate change if the island states are to survive .
representatives of the affected states regularly travel from one climate conference to the other to push industrialized nations , mainly responsible for climate change , to take action .
but the results so far have been modest as seen at the global climate conference in copenhagen in december 2009 .
the deal reached at the summit fell short of expectations .
" we must create more public awareness in the world about our problems , " rilwan said .
" we 're only the ones at the forefront . "

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

the flow of migrants worldwide fell by 6 percent in 2008 compared with past years which saw an average annual rise of 11 per cent .
the drop means some 4.4 million fewer people moving around the world , according to the oecd report .
the oecd 's angel gurria told deutsche welle that the financial crisis had made dealing with global labor market trends harder .
" we have the very important potential impact of ageing .
and of course we have to go for every single measure that can improve productivity , " he said .

" it will vary a little bit between the countries but we will have a continuous stable need for work force .

" a long-term legal migration policy that is well organized will continue to pay a very important role in filling the labor gaps within the eu and meeting the demographic challenges . "

" and it 's very important to do work on this side , on the area of communication , in order to stress that europe is not a fortress . "
the oecd says few unemployed migrants are returning home .
it also notes that in some countries there has been an increase in employment rates among immigrant women , who took up extra work after their husbands lost their jobs .

statistics show that the qualifications levels among young people with migration backgrounds are far too low . maria boehmer , the government official responsible for migration , says that too many foreigners are currently employed in jobs below their qualifications .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .
the local traders are looking for around 50-60 items to trade .
and also the traders want to visit each other .
they are looking for a kind of visa that will enable them to travel at least for a year without any restrictions . " both india and pakistan claim kashmir as a whole .

the un command said in a statement the north 's army representatives requested a delay " for administrative reasons " .
no new time has been set .
a joint team of investigators involving military officers and civilian experts from the south , the united states and sweden in may accused the north of launching a torpedo attack on the south korean warship cheonan , killing 46 sailors .
military officers from north korea and the un command that oversees the korean war truce were to meet at the korean border of panmunjom to discuss the sinking of the ship .
it would have been the first meeting since the sinking on march 26 , which sharply raised tension on the divided korean peninsula .

north korea celebrated the statement as a diplomatic victory .

germany has made market reform a priority issue at european and global policy meetings , leading by example with new regulations on the financial sector .
but not everyone thinks berlin 's can-do approach is effective . almost two years after the collapse of lehman brothers investment bank triggered the financial crisis , market reform efforts are finally beginning to take shape .
the united states has made the most progress , setting up control mechanisms and granting investors the right to more information on financial products .
meanwhile , european union member states have agreed to largely symbolic measures like the capping of bankers ' bonus payments .
the push for deeper reform has become a bogged down in the debate over how much regulatory power can be concentrated in brussels without sacrificing national sovereignty .
throughout this process , germany has actively promoted some proposals , blocked others , and even chosen to ' go it alone ' on occasion .
bank levy one key measure that germany and the rest of the eu pushed hard at the summit of g-20 nations last month was the introduction of a bank levy .
although europe failed to convince the rest of the group to adopt the tax , a number of countries , including germany , are moving to introduce a levy of their own accord .
berlin wants financial institutions to contribute 0.04 percent of their balance sheets - minus customer deposits - annually to help fund future bailouts .
andreas neukirch , the chairman of gls bank , describes the proposed legislation as a " blunt instrument " because it does n't influence the lenders ' day-to-day operations .
he argues that it could lead to even more risk-taking .
" -lrb- there 's a risk -rrb- that the bankers involved will say ' well , we 've paid into the insurance fund , so we 're entitled to get something back ' , " neukirch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas neukirch from gls bank supports a new transaction tax transaction tax neukirch says the introduction of a transaction tax would be more effective than a flat levy because banks would be charged according to their turnover .
the german government managed to muster support for the tax across the eu , but once again , the proposal was shot down at the g-20 summit by emerging markets and non-european industrialized nations .
the actual implementation of a european transaction tax would most likely have been blocked by the united kingdom , which is home to a large number of major financial institutions .
" if leading economies like germany introduce such a tax , they wo n't see capital flows move elsewhere to avoid payment .
instead , they 'll see more and more countries follow suit .
at least , that 's the signal we 're getting from those smaller european nations that would climb on board if germany were to make the first move . "
but for now it does n't look as though berlin is prepared to take unilateral action .
lawmakers fear that a solo attempt to introduce a transaction tax could harm the nation 's economic recovery .
" the result would be that many of the stock exchange transactions that currently take place in frankfurt would instead be handled in luxembourg , singapore , london or new york , " said andreas schmitz , the president of the federal association of german banks .
relocation risk singapore is already looking to lure european hedge fund managers to the city-state with low taxes and a newly developed business district equipped with cutting edge trading facilities .
german funds may be among the first to relocate .
last week lawmakers in berlin approved legislation to " prevent misuse of stock and derivative markets " .
the law prohibits ' naked short selling ' - a process in which traders bet on falling prices by selling a stock they do not own in the hope they can buy it back later at a discount .
if the price of the stock does indeed fall , the trader makes a hefty profit - but if the price rises , they incur large losses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say berlin is unlikely to influence the london-based hedge fund industry the unilateral ban attracted harsh criticism from both domestic and international observers .
even former west german chancellor helmut schmidt piped up , telling cicero magazine that the merkel government 's attempt to curb global speculation by going it alone was laughable .
financial expert karl-heinz paque from the university of magdeburg agrees : " the federal government obviously wanted to send a message , but all experts agree that it wo n't make any difference because the majority of short selling occurs in london . "
" this is not a good policy , " paque added . " this is merely action for the sake of action . "
with more than 80 percent of european hedge funds operating from offices in london , andreas neukirch from gls bank says the german ban will neither stop speculation nor disadvantage german financial institutions .
" i 'm confident -lrb- the ban on naked short selling -rrb- will not harm the economy or the citizens of germany , " neukirch said .
" instead it will help prevent really unjustified market fluctuations and dampen the escalation effect in times of crisis . "
" in my opinion , you ca n't go wrong with a ban on short selling . "

if the state is not in a position to do it ... the state can turn to the -lsb- rescue system -rsb- , but only under the conditions which the rules impose , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on tuesday .
some german and spanish banks are seen as the weakest links in the european banking system .
according to a study by pricewaterhousecoopers , german banks had the highest number of bad loans on their books at the end of 2009 , amounting to over 212 billion euros -lrb- $ 269 -rrb- .
doubts over banks ' abilities to clean up their balance sheets have hampered efforts to raise funding and made them dependent on liquidity provided by the european central bank in the wake of the global financial crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 13.07.2010 eu seeks compromise on genetically modified crops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biotech companies are also concerned about the eu proposal the european commission has proposed a compromise in the dispute over genetically modified crops .
it wants to devolve power to national governments , but it seems to have upset both gm proponents and detractors alike . in an unprecedented step to hand european union powers back to member states , the bloc 's executive - the european commission - has drafted plans to give countries the freedom to decide for themselves whether to grow or ban genetically modified crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european health commissioner john dalli says the executive is neutral the move is the result of frustration over years of deadlock over introducing the technology into the eu . the proposal would enable member states to prohibit the cultivation of gm crops that have already been scientifically approved , using economic , social and ethical reasons as the justification for the bans . countries would have the power to prohibit cultivating the crops on all or part of their territories . under the current system , gm crop applications are examined by a panel of experts from eu states and need to pass with a qualified majority .
in the case of a deadlock , the decision goes to eu ministers and if an impasse persists , the european commission is left with the final decision . to date , only two varieties of gm crops have been approved in the bloc , compared to around 150 world-wide . more legal disputes ? opponents of genetically modified food are worried that biotech companies will take advantage of the new proposal to force more of their products into the union . " any country wanting to ban gm crops under these proposals will open themselves up to legal challenges from the biotech corporations who want to force gm crops into europe , " said mute schimpf , food campaigner for environmental group friends of the earth europe . the uk-based organization gm freeze warned that members of the eu opposed to gm crops could be exposed to fresh trade complaints , which would be difficult to defend against . " member states should approach the commission 's proposals claiming to facilitate bans on gm crops with extreme caution , " said pete riley , campaigns director at gm freeze . " they need to ensure that in the short and long term that they will be able to ban a gm crop without ending up in court or with a wto dispute . " riley said he was n't categorically opposed to the proposal . allowing member states the right to make the final decision on gm crops is " the right thing to do , " he said , but he is concerned that what is on the table " appears to be subject to last minute changes . " biotech disappointment however , far from celebrating a business opportunity , some biotech proponents are expressing concerns about the prospects of more – not fewer – legal battles in future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in early 2010 , the eu authorized the cultivation of the genetically modified amflora potato " our fear is that it -lrb- the proposal -rrb- will be misused by governments to ban products indiscriminately , " carel du marchie sarvaas - from the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- - told deutsche welle . " we are science-based people , so when we hear politicians say that it 's ok to ban something for political reasons , we find that hard to live with . " " you 're going to have different rules in different eu countries , " said julian little , spokesman for german biotech firm bayer cropscience . " it 's just inviting legal disputes , and the lawyers are going to love it . " farming perspective farmers are also unimpressed . copa-cogeca - an organization representing farmers and agricultural cooperatives in the eu - is worried that differing rules between european countries would jeopardize the eu 's internal market and distort competition between the bloc 's farmers . " this will result in new legal and commercial risks , which farmers can not cover themselves , " said copa-cogeca secretary-general pekka pesonen . " we also urge the commission to make sure that the independent eu food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- risk assessment process remains the basis of the gm authorization system , " added pesonen . however , the european commission appears determined to push through with its plans , and is no stranger to hostility on the issue - having defended the bloc 's current policy in global trade disputes while facing pressure at home for approving gm products in the first place . the new proposals have been designed to try and minimize the chances for governments or the european parliament to block or change them . author : eva wutke -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it wants to devolve power to national governments , but it seems to have upset both gm proponents and detractors alike . in an unprecedented step to hand european union powers back to member states , the bloc 's executive - the european commission - has drafted plans to give countries the freedom to decide for themselves whether to grow or ban genetically modified crops . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european health commissioner john dalli says the executive is neutral the move is the result of frustration over years of deadlock over introducing the technology into the eu . the proposal would enable member states to prohibit the cultivation of gm crops that have already been scientifically approved , using economic , social and ethical reasons as the justification for the bans . countries would have the power to prohibit cultivating the crops on all or part of their territories . under the current system , gm crop applications are examined by a panel of experts from eu states and need to pass with a qualified majority .
in the case of a deadlock , the decision goes to eu ministers and if an impasse persists , the european commission is left with the final decision . to date , only two varieties of gm crops have been approved in the bloc , compared to around 150 world-wide . more legal disputes ? opponents of genetically modified food are worried that biotech companies will take advantage of the new proposal to force more of their products into the union . " any country wanting to ban gm crops under these proposals will open themselves up to legal challenges from the biotech corporations who want to force gm crops into europe , " said mute schimpf , food campaigner for environmental group friends of the earth europe . the uk-based organization gm freeze warned that members of the eu opposed to gm crops could be exposed to fresh trade complaints , which would be difficult to defend against . " member states should approach the commission 's proposals claiming to facilitate bans on gm crops with extreme caution , " said pete riley , campaigns director at gm freeze . " they need to ensure that in the short and long term that they will be able to ban a gm crop without ending up in court or with a wto dispute . " riley said he was n't categorically opposed to the proposal . allowing member states the right to make the final decision on gm crops is " the right thing to do , " he said , but he is concerned that what is on the table " appears to be subject to last minute changes . " biotech disappointment however , far from celebrating a business opportunity , some biotech proponents are expressing concerns about the prospects of more – not fewer – legal battles in future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in early 2010 , the eu authorized the cultivation of the genetically modified amflora potato " our fear is that it -lrb- the proposal -rrb- will be misused by governments to ban products indiscriminately , " carel du marchie sarvaas - from the european association for bioindustries -lrb- europabio -rrb- - told deutsche welle . " we are science-based people , so when we hear politicians say that it 's ok to ban something for political reasons , we find that hard to live with . " " you 're going to have different rules in different eu countries , " said julian little , spokesman for german biotech firm bayer cropscience . " it 's just inviting legal disputes , and the lawyers are going to love it . " farming perspective farmers are also unimpressed . copa-cogeca - an organization representing farmers and agricultural cooperatives in the eu - is worried that differing rules between european countries would jeopardize the eu 's internal market and distort competition between the bloc 's farmers . " this will result in new legal and commercial risks , which farmers can not cover themselves , " said copa-cogeca secretary-general pekka pesonen . " we also urge the commission to make sure that the independent eu food safety authority -lrb- efsa -rrb- risk assessment process remains the basis of the gm authorization system , " added pesonen . however , the european commission appears determined to push through with its plans , and is no stranger to hostility on the issue - having defended the bloc 's current policy in global trade disputes while facing pressure at home for approving gm products in the first place . the new proposals have been designed to try and minimize the chances for governments or the european parliament to block or change them . author : eva wutke -lrb- afp / reuters -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 13.07.2010 paul the octopus retires , but a future in spain beckons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oracle paul has become famous paul the octopus was an uncanny judge of germany 's world cup fortunes .
now , he can relax and retire in his aquarium in oberhausen , in northern germany .
a village in spain , however , would like to give him a new home . for weeks during the world cup , long lines formed in front of the sea life aquarium in oberhausen despite the summer heat , with people waiting patiently to enter the park .
an uninformed observer might think , ' why do n't they just head to the nearest swimming pool in this weather ? '
the answer : this is where paul lives .
and paul is an attraction .
paul is a two-and-a-half-year-old octopus .
he has eight arms , nine brains and three hearts .
an animal with such ' interior values ' might after all really have soothsaying qualities .
two years ago , during the european football championship , paul gave the first samples of his abilities as an oracle .
how does he do it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul correctly picked the winner of all of germany 's matches paul loves mussels . during the 2008 tournament , someone came up with the idea to take two glass containers , drape each with the flag of one of the competing teams , and place a mussel inside .
enter paul the octopus , who would hover over the boxes , choose one of the mussels and fish it out - thus predicting which team would win that particular match .
sounds easy , but it is n't .
the aquarium followed the same procedure this year during the world cup , and paul was right every time . people wondered how he did it , and turned to scientists .
as it turns out , there are plenty of answers , not all of them scientific .
favorite color or sense of smell ?
one explanation : the color combination .
maybe paul the oracle likes red-yellow .
both the spanish and the german flag sport these colors .
maybe that 's why he made the wrong choice back in the 2008 finals , when he predicted germany would win .
he never made that mistake again .
are his other correct predictions due to the fact that neither england -lrb- red-white -rrb- nor argentina and uruguay -lrb- blue-white -rrb- have the right color combination in their flags ?
but why then did paul choose the serbian box -lrb- blue-red-white -rrb- over the german one in the second group stage match ?
a second explanation might help solve that dilemma : the octopus has an excellent sense of smell .
sea life is adamant that both mussels came from the same source and were of identical quality , and that may very well be true from a human perspective . but it 's possible that the octopus with the sensitive nose went for the better mussel .
but even in this case , the prediction 's concurrence with the actual outcome of the match leaves too much room for coincidence .
bildunterschrift : many a german wished this fate on paul bodyguards for an octopus be that as it may , paul has gained worldwide fame . and like every other star , he does n't only have fans .
threats from disappointed german and dutch soccer fans can be found on the internet under " octopus paul , we know where your tank is . "
the internet was swamped by octopus recipes and pictures of octopuses hung out to dry .
a video on youtube showed brutal scenes from chinese restaurants , where live octopuses were tossed into a boiling liquid .
but none of that really matters to cuddly paul in his oberhausen aquarium .
sea life arranged for 24 hour ' security ' for the animal , successfully fending off any cowardly attacks .
retired octopus now that the world cup is over , the hoopla has died down somewhat .
which is a good thing .
after all , paul is two-and-a-half years old , a respectable age for an octopus .
he needs his rest .
as a matter of fact , paul might not be around much longer . while sea life wants to make sure he is content until he dies , paul 's fans do n't want him to retire .
the aquarium receives hundreds of emails every day with oracle questions for the mollusk .
questions like : " how long will merkel 's coalition last ? " or " am i going to get a d in math this year ? " are fun , but paul , according to scientific expertise , ca n't answer them .
so , in the end , the soothsaying octopus can peacefully swim through his tank toward that eternal resting place under water .
spain misses out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paella is not to be the famous oracle 's fate after all a generous offer from spain is not likely to change his fate .
a village in the northwestern part of the country has collected money and would like to buy paul for 30,000 euros -lrb- $ 37,720 -rrb- .
they want him to perform , though not as an oracle but as a mascot for a food festival with plenty of octopus specialties on the menu . evil be to him who evil thinks ...
but sea life in oberhausen wo n't be swayed by the tempting offer .
oberhausen is where paul will stay , where it 's clear this octopus is not going to end up in a paella .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .

in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward .

the talks are aimed at building mutual trust and resuming peace talks . following the meeting between the prime ministers of india and pakistan in bhutan in april , the foreign ministers of the two sides were charged with creating trust between the two governments .
this is why india 's foreign affairs minister sm krishna will be travelling to pakistan on thursday on a three day visit .
it is a move that has been widely welcomed . " this is good that the process is now starting and the two foreign ministers are meeting .
before that the foreign secretaries ' meeting and the meeting of the home ministers went well in islamabad , and i hope in this meeting they will be able to take some measures to build some confidence , " says imtiaz alam , a senior pakistani journalist and the president of the south asia free media association in lahore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign minister sm krishna composite dialogue after conducting nuclear tests in 1998 , both sides launched confidence building measures .
in 2004 , the two sides started a composite peace dialogue , which covered eight issues , including kashmir , terrorism , trade and people-to-people contact .
but following the attacks on mumbai that were blamed on pakistan-based militants , india suspended the peace process . with the changed scenario in the past two years , some believe the two sides may put the old composite dialogue on the backburner and develop a new mechanism to negotiate with each other , whereas others think building on the composite dialogue is the only way forward . " the old dialogue is comprehensive , " says d suba chandran , an expert on india-pakistan relations in new delhi .
" what was agreed in 1998 provides a very good basic structure to speak on all issues from nuclear to trade . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the taj hotel of mumbai was one of the many locations attacked by terrorists in 2008 india 's toned down position after the mumbai attacks , india had insisted on resuming the dialogue only on condition that pakistan brings the chief of the outlawed militant group lashkar-e-taiba , hafiz saeed to justice .
india says he is the mastermind of the mumbai attacks .
pakistan has insisted that it has no evidence against saeed and maintains that it has charged seven other people in connection with the atrocity in india 's financial capital . though indian foreign minister s m krishna has maintained that the issue of terrorism is going to be high on india 's agenda during the upcoming talks , there is a feeling of late that india has actually toned down its position and is interested in continuing dialogue with pakistan . " pakistan is never likely to hand over those people .
it is a political issue , " explains suba chandran .
" india has made its point and there is a widespread international support for india 's position and nothing much can be done outside this .
i think now it is a liability in terms of sticking to same point .
india has to talk to its neighbor . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pakistan 's foreign minister shah mahmood qureshi kashmir issue the meeting also comes at a time when tension is simmering in indian-administered kashmir after the recent anti-government protests and unrest that has left 15 civilians dead .
new delhi has blamed lashkar-e-taiba for instigating the violence . pakistan has expressed concerns over the situation in kashmir and foreign minister qureshi has said that he will raise the issue during the meeting with his indian counterpart .
but many doubt if there will any breakthrough on the dispute itself .
" that has been on the agenda for the last 60 years .
it will remain so .
so it would be very premature to expect this meeting to focus on the kashmir issue .
it is a long-term issue and will not be resolved in the short term , " says imtiaz alam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian-administered kashmir has recently been tense possible agreements on smaller issues the talks may however produce statements on issues such as boosting cross-border train and bus services and trade also in the kashmir region , says suba chandran . " as of now the trade is taking place on a barter system and there is no exchange of currency .
and we hope there will be some announcement in terms of goods that are being traded .
as of now there are 21 items .
the local traders are looking for around 50-60 items to trade .
and also the traders want to visit each other .
they are looking for a kind of visa that will enable them to travel at least for a year without any restrictions . " both india and pakistan claim kashmir as a whole .
they have fought several wars over the region in the past five decades . author : disha uppal editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
