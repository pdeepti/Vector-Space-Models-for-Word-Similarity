however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '

that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .

in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .

the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
the inquiry is focusing on whether the government has been transparent about the events in kunduz or whether there have been attempts to cover up possible wrongdoing by german officers .
a surge of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , and the death of seven soldiers over the last two weeks , have also reignited the controversy over whether the germany military should be part of the nato mission .

she is expected to reconfirm the government 's commitment to and support of the troops in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 19.04.2010 merkel praises scale of innovation at hanover trade fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was rather taken with this robot at the hanover fair despite the enormous volcanic ash cloud over europe preventing hundreds of exhibitors from making it to hanover , the world 's largest exhibition of industrial technology is expecting to have its best year ever . chancellor angela merkel was supposed to be joined by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi at the ceremony to kick off this year 's hanover fair .
however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 19.04.2010 volcanic ash is too hot to handle : insurers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eyjafjallajokull volcano has grounded thousands of flights ouch .
airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

we 've been planning a vacation to italy for almost a year .
now it seems in jeopardy with this volcanic ash cloud .
as of right now , rome airport is still open .
but who knows for how long ?
we are to depart for rome this coming tuesday night , in 72 hours .
will we be able to ?
we are on pins and needles , and praying to auster , the roman god of the south wind .
let 's hope he huffs and he puffs and he blows that dang cloud away ! - paula , us my husband was stuck in helsinki on thursday .
on saturday , he and his business associate took a ferry to stockholm , then a train to oslo in hopes of flying out to the us on monday .
he is from michigan and is on business .
he sells aircraft parts to european airlines .
he wonders how this disruption and potential future disruption in european air travel will affect his long term business .
if the volcano continues to erupt , it could mean long term delays and disruptions . - daryl , us i 'm from florida and i 'm getting married in about 15 days .
my fiancé is german and his family and friends are flying in to florida for the wedding .
some friends and family were already planning to travel this week and we are literally on the edge of our seats waiting to see if the flight bans will be lifted in dusseldorf and cologne .
it would be such a shame if half of our guests could not make it !
we are praying that the air clears up soon ... very soon . - diana , us i am one of about 100 people stranded in bangkok on a flight from ho chi minh city to frankfurt and onward flights to destinations in europe and north africa .
we are all yearning for forecasts of how long the different airports will be closed and at what time decisions about the reopening will be taken at those airports .
it would be great if deutsche welle could regularly broadcast an info chart with this information on tv and on their website . - karl h. hergarten , germany the airspace closures appear to originate with bureaucrats applying the precautionary principle on the basis of the ba 009 event -lsb- june 1982 , a british airways 747 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of mount galunggung , indonesia , resulting in the temporary failure of all four engines - ed -rsb- i believe there is a need to base decisions on engineering and scientific information instead .
we need to know what the vulnerability of each aircraft type really is , relative to various -lrb- low -rrb- levels of ash concentration .
and we also need to know what the actual concentrations and nature of contaminants are .
piston engine aircraft , which have intake air filtration , possibly are no more vulnerable to low levels of contamination than cars and trucks are .
historically jets have routinely operated in low level sand and ash contamination conditions without problems other than potentially accelerated wear .
we know high levels of ash are a big no-no .
no question about that .
but we need to know what the real boundaries are relating to low levels .
so , more should be done to rigorously investigate the danger .
and it needs to be carried out urgently to avoid major job losses . - martin geliot , germany i work at sfo and see all major european airlines aircraft parked at the edge of the terminal and i see some people are kinda camping out in the food courts .
this will cause lasting problems for weeks after the ash cloud settles . - michael ray peterson , us people i know are having problems with their travel plans .

however , eu transport ministers are to discuss the possible reopening of airspace . the german aviation authority , dfs , announced that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who have been stranded for days . the closure of airspace over germany and much of europe is costing the airline industry millions of dollars .
however , european union officials say they are optimistic that much of the airspace above the continent will soon reopen .
only a fifth of flights took to the air on sunday , but some say this figure could rise to a half on monday .
spain , which holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , has organised a telephone conference of eu transport ministers to assess the situation and has ordered a full study into the economic impact created by the volcanic ash .
a senior eu official said the current situation was not sustainable .
" we can not wait until the ash flows just disappear , " said transport commissioner siim kallas .
speaking at a press conference in brussels , he added that he hoped that 50 percent of european airspace would be risk-free on monday .

a grouping of the continent 's 36 major carriers called on governments for an " immediate reassessment " of the restrictions , saying they were having a " devastating impact " on the industry .
they questioned whether the measures taken were proportionate .
" airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly , " the association of european airlines said .
" it is what our passengers demand of us . "

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .
nato mission remains unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of seven soldiers has reignited the debate about the mission the attack , and the subsequent revelations that many civilians were among the 142 dead , triggered a wide debate in germany .
the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
the inquiry is focusing on whether the government has been transparent about the events in kunduz or whether there have been attempts to cover up possible wrongdoing by german officers .
a surge of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , and the death of seven soldiers over the last two weeks , have also reignited the controversy over whether the germany military should be part of the nato mission .
a memorial service for four german soldiers killed last week is scheduled for thursday and a government spokesman has announced that chancellor angela merkel will take part .
she is expected to reconfirm the government 's commitment to and support of the troops in afghanistan .
the announcement of the suspension of the investigation into colonel klein was welcomed by defense minister guttenberg .

shashi tharoor is accused of lobbying for a 330 million dollar bid for a new cricket franchise in the indian premier league or ipl . it all started with a tweet .
almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .
but the issue attracted a lot of media attention and sparked protests from the opposition parties , who demanded his resignation . political expert mahesh rangarajan says the incident had threatened to cast a shadow on the ruling party and the government , which had no option left but to ask tharoor to resign . " personal lives of indian politicians have almost never been a subject of media attention .
but when there are personal relationships with individuals who also happen to have business interests and the minister appears to have played a role in promoting those interests and is unable to even convince his own party and government leadership that they should defend him , then obviously he has crossed the line . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tharoor has a large twitter following controversial political career following his long career as a un diplomat , scholar and author , 54 year old tharoor stood in the national poll last year .
he became the mp for the well-known thiruvananthapuram constituency in the southern indian state of kerala . tharoor , seen as a reformist politician , became one of the first few leaders to use social networking sites such as twitter to put his message across to a mass audience .
his outspoken and at times controversial tweets , which also included remarks about his own government 's policies , earned him not just a large number of twitter followers , but also a host of critics . his remarks also sparked debate about how far politicians should go in the public domain and where should they draw the line .
expert rangarajan says , " it is not the fact that tharoor twitters , but some times the kind of language that he used which got him into controversy .
and this time , i think it was a serious error of judgement . " ipl probe tharoor 's associate sunanda pushkar has meanwhile surrendered her stake in the new franchise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood stars and billionaire entrepreneurs are among the ipl 's franchise owners but the case seems to have opened a veritable pandora 's box .
the opposition parties claim the indian premier league itself is a front for illicit gambling .
the government says it has launched an investigation into the matter .
indian finance minister pranab mukherjee addressed parliament on monday .
" i can assure all honorable members that all aspects of ipl including its sources of funding and how these funds were routed and invested will be looked into , " said mukherjee .
" no wrong-doers will be spared . " ipl chief lalit modi has also come under scrutiny .
tax officials have already visited ipl offices in mumbai and questioned modi , who denies all the allegations , calling them an " attempt to discredit the indian premier league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.04.2010 signs are growing that striker kuranyi will get germany recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi hopes he 's headed to south africa germany national coach joachim loew probably will have to take black sheep kevin kuranyi along to the world cup in south africa .
but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "

but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .

that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .

writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

shashi tharoor is accused of lobbying for a 330 million dollar bid for a new cricket franchise in the indian premier league or ipl . it all started with a tweet .
almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .
but the issue attracted a lot of media attention and sparked protests from the opposition parties , who demanded his resignation . political expert mahesh rangarajan says the incident had threatened to cast a shadow on the ruling party and the government , which had no option left but to ask tharoor to resign . " personal lives of indian politicians have almost never been a subject of media attention .
but when there are personal relationships with individuals who also happen to have business interests and the minister appears to have played a role in promoting those interests and is unable to even convince his own party and government leadership that they should defend him , then obviously he has crossed the line . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tharoor has a large twitter following controversial political career following his long career as a un diplomat , scholar and author , 54 year old tharoor stood in the national poll last year .
he became the mp for the well-known thiruvananthapuram constituency in the southern indian state of kerala . tharoor , seen as a reformist politician , became one of the first few leaders to use social networking sites such as twitter to put his message across to a mass audience .
his outspoken and at times controversial tweets , which also included remarks about his own government 's policies , earned him not just a large number of twitter followers , but also a host of critics . his remarks also sparked debate about how far politicians should go in the public domain and where should they draw the line .
expert rangarajan says , " it is not the fact that tharoor twitters , but some times the kind of language that he used which got him into controversy .
and this time , i think it was a serious error of judgement . " ipl probe tharoor 's associate sunanda pushkar has meanwhile surrendered her stake in the new franchise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood stars and billionaire entrepreneurs are among the ipl 's franchise owners but the case seems to have opened a veritable pandora 's box .
the opposition parties claim the indian premier league itself is a front for illicit gambling .
the government says it has launched an investigation into the matter .
indian finance minister pranab mukherjee addressed parliament on monday .
" i can assure all honorable members that all aspects of ipl including its sources of funding and how these funds were routed and invested will be looked into , " said mukherjee .
" no wrong-doers will be spared . " ipl chief lalit modi has also come under scrutiny .
tax officials have already visited ipl offices in mumbai and questioned modi , who denies all the allegations , calling them an " attempt to discredit the indian premier league .

the london center is run by britain 's met office , the country 's national weather service .
the other centers are in toulouse in france , anchorage , alaska , and washington dc in the us , montreal in canada , darwin in australia , wellington in new zealand , tokyo in japan and buenos aires in argentina .
the volcanic ash advisory centers are part of an international system set up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- .
responsibilities the centers analyze and publish observations of volcanic ash from volcano observatories and other organisations , satellites and aircraft in flight .
they also issue warnings and , since the mid 1990s , publish volcanic ash advisory messages , identifying areas of volcanic ash and their predicted movements .
the london center is responsible for monitoring and forecasting the movement of volcanic ash over the united kingdom , iceland and the north-eastern part of the north atlantic ocean .
although this is a relatively small area , it includes some of the busiest airways in the world .
as millions of stranded passengers have now experienced at first hand , a volcanic eruption in iceland can quickly affect a large area of airspace , as strong winds spread the ash from the volcano .
in such an event , the london vaac liaises closely with the icelandic weather service , which is in close contact with the nordic volcano institute .
the data the center collects comes from seismic surveys carried out by the nordic institute , eyewitness accounts of current volcanic activity and from analyses of satellite pictures. ng -lrb- based on information from the british met office -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .

a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .

" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .

a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .

however , eu transport ministers are to discuss the possible reopening of airspace . the german aviation authority , dfs , announced that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who have been stranded for days . the closure of airspace over germany and much of europe is costing the airline industry millions of dollars .
however , european union officials say they are optimistic that much of the airspace above the continent will soon reopen .
only a fifth of flights took to the air on sunday , but some say this figure could rise to a half on monday .
spain , which holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , has organised a telephone conference of eu transport ministers to assess the situation and has ordered a full study into the economic impact created by the volcanic ash .
a senior eu official said the current situation was not sustainable .
" we can not wait until the ash flows just disappear , " said transport commissioner siim kallas .
speaking at a press conference in brussels , he added that he hoped that 50 percent of european airspace would be risk-free on monday .
test flights clear pressure to lift the no-fly zone has been strongest from european airlines , which have launched flights to gather information about the danger of the volcanic cloud damaging jet engines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa is pushing for the ban to be lifted after successful test flights germany 's flag carrier , lufthansa , air france , british airways , and dutch carrier klm have so far reported no problems .
" the conditions were perfect and the aircraft encountered no difficulties , " a british airways spokesman said , though the jumbo jet used was going in for tests and data analysis .
a grouping of the continent 's 36 major carriers called on governments for an " immediate reassessment " of the restrictions , saying they were having a " devastating impact " on the industry .
they questioned whether the measures taken were proportionate .
" airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly , " the association of european airlines said .
" it is what our passengers demand of us . "
europe at a standstill about 30 countries have closed or restricted their airspace due to passenger safety fears , catching 6.8 million passengers in a global backlog , according to the international airports council , aci .
" more than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far and european airports have lost close to 136 million euros -lrb- 183 million dollars -rrb- , " said its european head olivier jankovec .
a total of 313 airports had been paralysed by the restrictions , he added. cb / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.04.2010 signs are growing that striker kuranyi will get germany recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi hopes he 's headed to south africa germany national coach joachim loew probably will have to take black sheep kevin kuranyi along to the world cup in south africa .
but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

however , eu transport ministers are to discuss the possible reopening of airspace . the german aviation authority , dfs , announced that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who have been stranded for days . the closure of airspace over germany and much of europe is costing the airline industry millions of dollars .
however , european union officials say they are optimistic that much of the airspace above the continent will soon reopen .
only a fifth of flights took to the air on sunday , but some say this figure could rise to a half on monday .
spain , which holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , has organised a telephone conference of eu transport ministers to assess the situation and has ordered a full study into the economic impact created by the volcanic ash .
a senior eu official said the current situation was not sustainable .
" we can not wait until the ash flows just disappear , " said transport commissioner siim kallas .
speaking at a press conference in brussels , he added that he hoped that 50 percent of european airspace would be risk-free on monday .
test flights clear pressure to lift the no-fly zone has been strongest from european airlines , which have launched flights to gather information about the danger of the volcanic cloud damaging jet engines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa is pushing for the ban to be lifted after successful test flights germany 's flag carrier , lufthansa , air france , british airways , and dutch carrier klm have so far reported no problems .
" the conditions were perfect and the aircraft encountered no difficulties , " a british airways spokesman said , though the jumbo jet used was going in for tests and data analysis .
a grouping of the continent 's 36 major carriers called on governments for an " immediate reassessment " of the restrictions , saying they were having a " devastating impact " on the industry .
they questioned whether the measures taken were proportionate .
" airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly , " the association of european airlines said .
" it is what our passengers demand of us . "
europe at a standstill about 30 countries have closed or restricted their airspace due to passenger safety fears , catching 6.8 million passengers in a global backlog , according to the international airports council , aci .
" more than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far and european airports have lost close to 136 million euros -lrb- 183 million dollars -rrb- , " said its european head olivier jankovec .
a total of 313 airports had been paralysed by the restrictions , he added. cb / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 19.04.2010 volcanic ash is too hot to handle : insurers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eyjafjallajokull volcano has grounded thousands of flights ouch .
airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .
the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted on wednesday april 14 , spewing clouds of ash up to 10,000 meters -lrb- 32,810 feet -rrb- into the air .
the ash plume has resulted in tens of thousands of cancelled flights in and out of european airspace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.04.2010 a korean film about a forgotten massacre großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yang hae chan , a survivor of the no gun ri massacre not many people have heard of the alleged massacre that took place in the south korean village of no gun ri .
but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .
" the education system here does n't really teach what happened . i think the film will help educate people not only about no gun ri , but about the war in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and south korean soldiers conducting joint military exercises .
some say the film may trigger resentment toward the us soldiers still based in the country looking back into history journalist choe sang-hun is co-author of a book on the no gun ri incident . he says until recently , if koreans complained about war-time atrocities carried out by allied forces , they were called north korean sympathizers .
choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .
anti-american ?
a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .
" the education system here does n't really teach what happened . i think the film will help educate people not only about no gun ri , but about the war in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and south korean soldiers conducting joint military exercises .
some say the film may trigger resentment toward the us soldiers still based in the country looking back into history journalist choe sang-hun is co-author of a book on the no gun ri incident . he says until recently , if koreans complained about war-time atrocities carried out by allied forces , they were called north korean sympathizers .
choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .
anti-american ?
a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .

and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .

however , eu transport ministers are to discuss the possible reopening of airspace . the german aviation authority , dfs , announced that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who have been stranded for days . the closure of airspace over germany and much of europe is costing the airline industry millions of dollars .
however , european union officials say they are optimistic that much of the airspace above the continent will soon reopen .
only a fifth of flights took to the air on sunday , but some say this figure could rise to a half on monday .
spain , which holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , has organised a telephone conference of eu transport ministers to assess the situation and has ordered a full study into the economic impact created by the volcanic ash .
a senior eu official said the current situation was not sustainable .
" we can not wait until the ash flows just disappear , " said transport commissioner siim kallas .
speaking at a press conference in brussels , he added that he hoped that 50 percent of european airspace would be risk-free on monday .
test flights clear pressure to lift the no-fly zone has been strongest from european airlines , which have launched flights to gather information about the danger of the volcanic cloud damaging jet engines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa is pushing for the ban to be lifted after successful test flights germany 's flag carrier , lufthansa , air france , british airways , and dutch carrier klm have so far reported no problems .
" the conditions were perfect and the aircraft encountered no difficulties , " a british airways spokesman said , though the jumbo jet used was going in for tests and data analysis .
a grouping of the continent 's 36 major carriers called on governments for an " immediate reassessment " of the restrictions , saying they were having a " devastating impact " on the industry .
they questioned whether the measures taken were proportionate .
" airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly , " the association of european airlines said .
" it is what our passengers demand of us . "
europe at a standstill about 30 countries have closed or restricted their airspace due to passenger safety fears , catching 6.8 million passengers in a global backlog , according to the international airports council , aci .
" more than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far and european airports have lost close to 136 million euros -lrb- 183 million dollars -rrb- , " said its european head olivier jankovec .
a total of 313 airports had been paralysed by the restrictions , he added. cb / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 19.04.2010 merkel praises scale of innovation at hanover trade fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was rather taken with this robot at the hanover fair despite the enormous volcanic ash cloud over europe preventing hundreds of exhibitors from making it to hanover , the world 's largest exhibition of industrial technology is expecting to have its best year ever . chancellor angela merkel was supposed to be joined by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi at the ceremony to kick off this year 's hanover fair .
however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

readers have sent in their experiences and comments . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
we 've been planning a vacation to italy for almost a year .
now it seems in jeopardy with this volcanic ash cloud .
as of right now , rome airport is still open .
but who knows for how long ?
we are to depart for rome this coming tuesday night , in 72 hours .
will we be able to ?
we are on pins and needles , and praying to auster , the roman god of the south wind .
let 's hope he huffs and he puffs and he blows that dang cloud away ! - paula , us my husband was stuck in helsinki on thursday .
on saturday , he and his business associate took a ferry to stockholm , then a train to oslo in hopes of flying out to the us on monday .
he is from michigan and is on business .
he sells aircraft parts to european airlines .
he wonders how this disruption and potential future disruption in european air travel will affect his long term business .
if the volcano continues to erupt , it could mean long term delays and disruptions . - daryl , us i 'm from florida and i 'm getting married in about 15 days .
my fiancé is german and his family and friends are flying in to florida for the wedding .
some friends and family were already planning to travel this week and we are literally on the edge of our seats waiting to see if the flight bans will be lifted in dusseldorf and cologne .
it would be such a shame if half of our guests could not make it !
we are praying that the air clears up soon ... very soon . - diana , us i am one of about 100 people stranded in bangkok on a flight from ho chi minh city to frankfurt and onward flights to destinations in europe and north africa .
we are all yearning for forecasts of how long the different airports will be closed and at what time decisions about the reopening will be taken at those airports .
it would be great if deutsche welle could regularly broadcast an info chart with this information on tv and on their website . - karl h. hergarten , germany the airspace closures appear to originate with bureaucrats applying the precautionary principle on the basis of the ba 009 event -lsb- june 1982 , a british airways 747 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of mount galunggung , indonesia , resulting in the temporary failure of all four engines - ed -rsb- i believe there is a need to base decisions on engineering and scientific information instead .
we need to know what the vulnerability of each aircraft type really is , relative to various -lrb- low -rrb- levels of ash concentration .
and we also need to know what the actual concentrations and nature of contaminants are .
piston engine aircraft , which have intake air filtration , possibly are no more vulnerable to low levels of contamination than cars and trucks are .
historically jets have routinely operated in low level sand and ash contamination conditions without problems other than potentially accelerated wear .
we know high levels of ash are a big no-no .
no question about that .
but we need to know what the real boundaries are relating to low levels .
so , more should be done to rigorously investigate the danger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.04.2010 signs are growing that striker kuranyi will get germany recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi hopes he 's headed to south africa germany national coach joachim loew probably will have to take black sheep kevin kuranyi along to the world cup in south africa .
but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

however , eu transport ministers are to discuss the possible reopening of airspace . the german aviation authority , dfs , announced that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who have been stranded for days . the closure of airspace over germany and much of europe is costing the airline industry millions of dollars .
however , european union officials say they are optimistic that much of the airspace above the continent will soon reopen .
only a fifth of flights took to the air on sunday , but some say this figure could rise to a half on monday .
spain , which holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , has organised a telephone conference of eu transport ministers to assess the situation and has ordered a full study into the economic impact created by the volcanic ash .
a senior eu official said the current situation was not sustainable .
" we can not wait until the ash flows just disappear , " said transport commissioner siim kallas .
speaking at a press conference in brussels , he added that he hoped that 50 percent of european airspace would be risk-free on monday .
test flights clear pressure to lift the no-fly zone has been strongest from european airlines , which have launched flights to gather information about the danger of the volcanic cloud damaging jet engines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa is pushing for the ban to be lifted after successful test flights germany 's flag carrier , lufthansa , air france , british airways , and dutch carrier klm have so far reported no problems .
" the conditions were perfect and the aircraft encountered no difficulties , " a british airways spokesman said , though the jumbo jet used was going in for tests and data analysis .
a grouping of the continent 's 36 major carriers called on governments for an " immediate reassessment " of the restrictions , saying they were having a " devastating impact " on the industry .
they questioned whether the measures taken were proportionate .
" airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly , " the association of european airlines said .
" it is what our passengers demand of us . "
europe at a standstill about 30 countries have closed or restricted their airspace due to passenger safety fears , catching 6.8 million passengers in a global backlog , according to the international airports council , aci .
" more than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far and european airports have lost close to 136 million euros -lrb- 183 million dollars -rrb- , " said its european head olivier jankovec .
a total of 313 airports had been paralysed by the restrictions , he added. cb / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .

that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .

in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .
nato mission remains unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of seven soldiers has reignited the debate about the mission the attack , and the subsequent revelations that many civilians were among the 142 dead , triggered a wide debate in germany .
the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
the inquiry is focusing on whether the government has been transparent about the events in kunduz or whether there have been attempts to cover up possible wrongdoing by german officers .
a surge of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , and the death of seven soldiers over the last two weeks , have also reignited the controversy over whether the germany military should be part of the nato mission .
a memorial service for four german soldiers killed last week is scheduled for thursday and a government spokesman has announced that chancellor angela merkel will take part .
she is expected to reconfirm the government 's commitment to and support of the troops in afghanistan .
the announcement of the suspension of the investigation into colonel klein was welcomed by defense minister guttenberg .
he said it provided " the greatest possible legal security " for german soldiers in afghanistan. ai / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

we 've been planning a vacation to italy for almost a year .
now it seems in jeopardy with this volcanic ash cloud .
as of right now , rome airport is still open .
but who knows for how long ?
we are to depart for rome this coming tuesday night , in 72 hours .
will we be able to ?
we are on pins and needles , and praying to auster , the roman god of the south wind .
let 's hope he huffs and he puffs and he blows that dang cloud away ! - paula , us my husband was stuck in helsinki on thursday .
on saturday , he and his business associate took a ferry to stockholm , then a train to oslo in hopes of flying out to the us on monday .
he is from michigan and is on business .
he sells aircraft parts to european airlines .
he wonders how this disruption and potential future disruption in european air travel will affect his long term business .
if the volcano continues to erupt , it could mean long term delays and disruptions . - daryl , us i 'm from florida and i 'm getting married in about 15 days .
my fiancé is german and his family and friends are flying in to florida for the wedding .
some friends and family were already planning to travel this week and we are literally on the edge of our seats waiting to see if the flight bans will be lifted in dusseldorf and cologne .
it would be such a shame if half of our guests could not make it !
we are praying that the air clears up soon ... very soon . - diana , us i am one of about 100 people stranded in bangkok on a flight from ho chi minh city to frankfurt and onward flights to destinations in europe and north africa .
we are all yearning for forecasts of how long the different airports will be closed and at what time decisions about the reopening will be taken at those airports .
it would be great if deutsche welle could regularly broadcast an info chart with this information on tv and on their website . - karl h. hergarten , germany the airspace closures appear to originate with bureaucrats applying the precautionary principle on the basis of the ba 009 event -lsb- june 1982 , a british airways 747 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of mount galunggung , indonesia , resulting in the temporary failure of all four engines - ed -rsb- i believe there is a need to base decisions on engineering and scientific information instead .
we need to know what the vulnerability of each aircraft type really is , relative to various -lrb- low -rrb- levels of ash concentration .
and we also need to know what the actual concentrations and nature of contaminants are .
piston engine aircraft , which have intake air filtration , possibly are no more vulnerable to low levels of contamination than cars and trucks are .
historically jets have routinely operated in low level sand and ash contamination conditions without problems other than potentially accelerated wear .
we know high levels of ash are a big no-no .
no question about that .
but we need to know what the real boundaries are relating to low levels .
so , more should be done to rigorously investigate the danger .
and it needs to be carried out urgently to avoid major job losses . - martin geliot , germany i work at sfo and see all major european airlines aircraft parked at the edge of the terminal and i see some people are kinda camping out in the food courts .
this will cause lasting problems for weeks after the ash cloud settles . - michael ray peterson , us people i know are having problems with their travel plans .

however , eu transport ministers are to discuss the possible reopening of airspace . the german aviation authority , dfs , announced that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who have been stranded for days . the closure of airspace over germany and much of europe is costing the airline industry millions of dollars .

spain , which holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , has organised a telephone conference of eu transport ministers to assess the situation and has ordered a full study into the economic impact created by the volcanic ash .
a senior eu official said the current situation was not sustainable .

a grouping of the continent 's 36 major carriers called on governments for an " immediate reassessment " of the restrictions , saying they were having a " devastating impact " on the industry .
they questioned whether the measures taken were proportionate .
" airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly , " the association of european airlines said .
" it is what our passengers demand of us . "
europe at a standstill about 30 countries have closed or restricted their airspace due to passenger safety fears , catching 6.8 million passengers in a global backlog , according to the international airports council , aci .
" more than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far and european airports have lost close to 136 million euros -lrb- 183 million dollars -rrb- , " said its european head olivier jankovec .
a total of 313 airports had been paralysed by the restrictions , he added. cb / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .

the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
the inquiry is focusing on whether the government has been transparent about the events in kunduz or whether there have been attempts to cover up possible wrongdoing by german officers .
a surge of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , and the death of seven soldiers over the last two weeks , have also reignited the controversy over whether the germany military should be part of the nato mission .
a memorial service for four german soldiers killed last week is scheduled for thursday and a government spokesman has announced that chancellor angela merkel will take part .
she is expected to reconfirm the government 's commitment to and support of the troops in afghanistan .
the announcement of the suspension of the investigation into colonel klein was welcomed by defense minister guttenberg .

almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .

shashi tharoor is accused of lobbying for a 330 million dollar bid for a new cricket franchise in the indian premier league or ipl . it all started with a tweet .
almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .
but the issue attracted a lot of media attention and sparked protests from the opposition parties , who demanded his resignation . political expert mahesh rangarajan says the incident had threatened to cast a shadow on the ruling party and the government , which had no option left but to ask tharoor to resign . " personal lives of indian politicians have almost never been a subject of media attention .

his outspoken and at times controversial tweets , which also included remarks about his own government 's policies , earned him not just a large number of twitter followers , but also a host of critics . his remarks also sparked debate about how far politicians should go in the public domain and where should they draw the line .
expert rangarajan says , " it is not the fact that tharoor twitters , but some times the kind of language that he used which got him into controversy .
and this time , i think it was a serious error of judgement .

the opposition parties claim the indian premier league itself is a front for illicit gambling .
the government says it has launched an investigation into the matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.04.2010 a korean film about a forgotten massacre großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yang hae chan , a survivor of the no gun ri massacre not many people have heard of the alleged massacre that took place in the south korean village of no gun ri .
but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .
" the education system here does n't really teach what happened . i think the film will help educate people not only about no gun ri , but about the war in general . "

some say the film may trigger resentment toward the us soldiers still based in the country looking back into history journalist choe sang-hun is co-author of a book on the no gun ri incident . he says until recently , if koreans complained about war-time atrocities carried out by allied forces , they were called north korean sympathizers .
choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .

a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .
" the education system here does n't really teach what happened . i think the film will help educate people not only about no gun ri , but about the war in general . "

choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .
anti-american ?
a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .
the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted on wednesday april 14 , spewing clouds of ash up to 10,000 meters -lrb- 32,810 feet -rrb- into the air .
the ash plume has resulted in tens of thousands of cancelled flights in and out of european airspace .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .

he said the planes would start to get ready immediately and would fly to frankfurt , munich and duesseldorf .
lufthansa and the country 's second largest airline air berlin have also restarted a limited number of shorter flights to popular holiday destinations , where thousands of people are still stranded due to grounded flights and closed airports as a cloud of volcano ashes makes its way across europe . the lufthansa spokesman said the permission granted by the german aviation authority dfs allowed them to fly by so-called visual flight rules and at a lower altitude than usual .
but as long as air traffic control maintains the restrictions on airspace , baerwald said , " we do n't have the chance to return to our regular schedule . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.04.2010 signs are growing that striker kuranyi will get germany recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi hopes he 's headed to south africa germany national coach joachim loew probably will have to take black sheep kevin kuranyi along to the world cup in south africa .
but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

a senior eu official said the current situation was not sustainable .

the london center is run by britain 's met office , the country 's national weather service .
the other centers are in toulouse in france , anchorage , alaska , and washington dc in the us , montreal in canada , darwin in australia , wellington in new zealand , tokyo in japan and buenos aires in argentina .
the volcanic ash advisory centers are part of an international system set up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- .
responsibilities the centers analyze and publish observations of volcanic ash from volcano observatories and other organisations , satellites and aircraft in flight .
they also issue warnings and , since the mid 1990s , publish volcanic ash advisory messages , identifying areas of volcanic ash and their predicted movements .
the london center is responsible for monitoring and forecasting the movement of volcanic ash over the united kingdom , iceland and the north-eastern part of the north atlantic ocean .
although this is a relatively small area , it includes some of the busiest airways in the world .
as millions of stranded passengers have now experienced at first hand , a volcanic eruption in iceland can quickly affect a large area of airspace , as strong winds spread the ash from the volcano .
in such an event , the london vaac liaises closely with the icelandic weather service , which is in close contact with the nordic volcano institute .
the data the center collects comes from seismic surveys carried out by the nordic institute , eyewitness accounts of current volcanic activity and from analyses of satellite pictures. ng -lrb- based on information from the british met office -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

we 've been planning a vacation to italy for almost a year .
now it seems in jeopardy with this volcanic ash cloud .
as of right now , rome airport is still open .
but who knows for how long ?
we are to depart for rome this coming tuesday night , in 72 hours .
will we be able to ?
we are on pins and needles , and praying to auster , the roman god of the south wind .
let 's hope he huffs and he puffs and he blows that dang cloud away ! - paula , us my husband was stuck in helsinki on thursday .
on saturday , he and his business associate took a ferry to stockholm , then a train to oslo in hopes of flying out to the us on monday .
he is from michigan and is on business .
he sells aircraft parts to european airlines .
he wonders how this disruption and potential future disruption in european air travel will affect his long term business .
if the volcano continues to erupt , it could mean long term delays and disruptions . - daryl , us i 'm from florida and i 'm getting married in about 15 days .
my fiancé is german and his family and friends are flying in to florida for the wedding .
some friends and family were already planning to travel this week and we are literally on the edge of our seats waiting to see if the flight bans will be lifted in dusseldorf and cologne .
it would be such a shame if half of our guests could not make it !
we are praying that the air clears up soon ... very soon . - diana , us i am one of about 100 people stranded in bangkok on a flight from ho chi minh city to frankfurt and onward flights to destinations in europe and north africa .
we are all yearning for forecasts of how long the different airports will be closed and at what time decisions about the reopening will be taken at those airports .
it would be great if deutsche welle could regularly broadcast an info chart with this information on tv and on their website . - karl h. hergarten , germany the airspace closures appear to originate with bureaucrats applying the precautionary principle on the basis of the ba 009 event -lsb- june 1982 , a british airways 747 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of mount galunggung , indonesia , resulting in the temporary failure of all four engines - ed -rsb- i believe there is a need to base decisions on engineering and scientific information instead .
we need to know what the vulnerability of each aircraft type really is , relative to various -lrb- low -rrb- levels of ash concentration .
and we also need to know what the actual concentrations and nature of contaminants are .
piston engine aircraft , which have intake air filtration , possibly are no more vulnerable to low levels of contamination than cars and trucks are .
historically jets have routinely operated in low level sand and ash contamination conditions without problems other than potentially accelerated wear .
we know high levels of ash are a big no-no .
no question about that .
but we need to know what the real boundaries are relating to low levels .
so , more should be done to rigorously investigate the danger .
and it needs to be carried out urgently to avoid major job losses . - martin geliot , germany i work at sfo and see all major european airlines aircraft parked at the edge of the terminal and i see some people are kinda camping out in the food courts .
this will cause lasting problems for weeks after the ash cloud settles . - michael ray peterson , us people i know are having problems with their travel plans .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

he said the planes would start to get ready immediately and would fly to frankfurt , munich and duesseldorf .
lufthansa and the country 's second largest airline air berlin have also restarted a limited number of shorter flights to popular holiday destinations , where thousands of people are still stranded due to grounded flights and closed airports as a cloud of volcano ashes makes its way across europe . the lufthansa spokesman said the permission granted by the german aviation authority dfs allowed them to fly by so-called visual flight rules and at a lower altitude than usual .
but as long as air traffic control maintains the restrictions on airspace , baerwald said , " we do n't have the chance to return to our regular schedule . "

but thousands of troops , some armed with machine guns , barred their way with the help of barbed wire and metal barricades .
demonstrations by tens of thousands of reds , mostly supporters of exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who come from the impoverished rural north of thailand , have paralyzed parts of bangkok for the last five weeks .

so far , the security forces have not been very efficient in dealing with the protests .
last friday , they failed to arrest several of the red movement 's leaders in a bungled operation .
tv pictures showing a red leader climbing out of a window to escape were widely seen as a complete humiliation for the authorities .
the government responded to this public relations disaster by putting army chief general anupong paochinda in charge of national security .
but the situation could explode at any time .
just nine days ago , an attempted crackdown led to clashes that left 25 people dead in thailand 's worst civil unrest for decades .
observers doubt whether the army and police really are willing to crush the demonstrations .
it is believed that there is a lot of support for thaksin and the red shirts amongst the lower ranks in both organisations .
thaksin himself is a former policeman .
on monday , he told reuters in an interview that the only way to end the current standoff was for the thai government to step down and call premature elections .

during a meeting on sunday , they gave the government an ultimatum of seven days to restore order .
the yellow shirts , belonging to the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- , brought down two pro-thaksin governments in 2008 with their months-long street protests , eventually paving the way for the current government of abhisit vejjajiva to come to power. tb / reuters / afp editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we 've been planning a vacation to italy for almost a year .
now it seems in jeopardy with this volcanic ash cloud .
as of right now , rome airport is still open .
but who knows for how long ?
we are to depart for rome this coming tuesday night , in 72 hours .
will we be able to ?
we are on pins and needles , and praying to auster , the roman god of the south wind .
let 's hope he huffs and he puffs and he blows that dang cloud away ! - paula , us my husband was stuck in helsinki on thursday .
on saturday , he and his business associate took a ferry to stockholm , then a train to oslo in hopes of flying out to the us on monday .
he is from michigan and is on business .
he sells aircraft parts to european airlines .
he wonders how this disruption and potential future disruption in european air travel will affect his long term business .
if the volcano continues to erupt , it could mean long term delays and disruptions . - daryl , us i 'm from florida and i 'm getting married in about 15 days .
my fiancé is german and his family and friends are flying in to florida for the wedding .
some friends and family were already planning to travel this week and we are literally on the edge of our seats waiting to see if the flight bans will be lifted in dusseldorf and cologne .
it would be such a shame if half of our guests could not make it !
we are praying that the air clears up soon ... very soon . - diana , us i am one of about 100 people stranded in bangkok on a flight from ho chi minh city to frankfurt and onward flights to destinations in europe and north africa .
we are all yearning for forecasts of how long the different airports will be closed and at what time decisions about the reopening will be taken at those airports .
it would be great if deutsche welle could regularly broadcast an info chart with this information on tv and on their website . - karl h. hergarten , germany the airspace closures appear to originate with bureaucrats applying the precautionary principle on the basis of the ba 009 event -lsb- june 1982 , a british airways 747 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of mount galunggung , indonesia , resulting in the temporary failure of all four engines - ed -rsb- i believe there is a need to base decisions on engineering and scientific information instead .
we need to know what the vulnerability of each aircraft type really is , relative to various -lrb- low -rrb- levels of ash concentration .
and we also need to know what the actual concentrations and nature of contaminants are .
piston engine aircraft , which have intake air filtration , possibly are no more vulnerable to low levels of contamination than cars and trucks are .
historically jets have routinely operated in low level sand and ash contamination conditions without problems other than potentially accelerated wear .
we know high levels of ash are a big no-no .
no question about that .
but we need to know what the real boundaries are relating to low levels .
so , more should be done to rigorously investigate the danger .
and it needs to be carried out urgently to avoid major job losses . - martin geliot , germany i work at sfo and see all major european airlines aircraft parked at the edge of the terminal and i see some people are kinda camping out in the food courts .
this will cause lasting problems for weeks after the ash cloud settles . - michael ray peterson , us people i know are having problems with their travel plans .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .
the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted on wednesday april 14 , spewing clouds of ash up to 10,000 meters -lrb- 32,810 feet -rrb- into the air .
the ash plume has resulted in tens of thousands of cancelled flights in and out of european airspace .

lufthansa spokesman jan baerwald said monday that the first flights would be from the far east , with others following from africa and north america .
he said the planes would start to get ready immediately and would fly to frankfurt , munich and duesseldorf .
lufthansa and the country 's second largest airline air berlin have also restarted a limited number of shorter flights to popular holiday destinations , where thousands of people are still stranded due to grounded flights and closed airports as a cloud of volcano ashes makes its way across europe . the lufthansa spokesman said the permission granted by the german aviation authority dfs allowed them to fly by so-called visual flight rules and at a lower altitude than usual .
but as long as air traffic control maintains the restrictions on airspace , baerwald said , " we do n't have the chance to return to our regular schedule . "

the london center is run by britain 's met office , the country 's national weather service .
the other centers are in toulouse in france , anchorage , alaska , and washington dc in the us , montreal in canada , darwin in australia , wellington in new zealand , tokyo in japan and buenos aires in argentina .
the volcanic ash advisory centers are part of an international system set up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- .
responsibilities the centers analyze and publish observations of volcanic ash from volcano observatories and other organisations , satellites and aircraft in flight .
they also issue warnings and , since the mid 1990s , publish volcanic ash advisory messages , identifying areas of volcanic ash and their predicted movements .
the london center is responsible for monitoring and forecasting the movement of volcanic ash over the united kingdom , iceland and the north-eastern part of the north atlantic ocean .
although this is a relatively small area , it includes some of the busiest airways in the world .
as millions of stranded passengers have now experienced at first hand , a volcanic eruption in iceland can quickly affect a large area of airspace , as strong winds spread the ash from the volcano .
in such an event , the london vaac liaises closely with the icelandic weather service , which is in close contact with the nordic volcano institute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 19.04.2010 play in pope 's former diocese confronts the topic of child abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play 's intensity has a powerful effect on the audience as stories of children molested by priests continue to rock germany , an intense play on the subject looks at how the lives of both victims and offenders can be affected by such incidents . in the small , 88-seat turmtheater in the german city of regensburg , a man clutching a sleeping young boy frantically bursts onto the stage , beginning the tense , hour-long drama " the confession . " the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .

the london center is run by britain 's met office , the country 's national weather service .
the other centers are in toulouse in france , anchorage , alaska , and washington dc in the us , montreal in canada , darwin in australia , wellington in new zealand , tokyo in japan and buenos aires in argentina .
the volcanic ash advisory centers are part of an international system set up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- .
responsibilities the centers analyze and publish observations of volcanic ash from volcano observatories and other organisations , satellites and aircraft in flight .
they also issue warnings and , since the mid 1990s , publish volcanic ash advisory messages , identifying areas of volcanic ash and their predicted movements .
the london center is responsible for monitoring and forecasting the movement of volcanic ash over the united kingdom , iceland and the north-eastern part of the north atlantic ocean .
although this is a relatively small area , it includes some of the busiest airways in the world .
as millions of stranded passengers have now experienced at first hand , a volcanic eruption in iceland can quickly affect a large area of airspace , as strong winds spread the ash from the volcano .
in such an event , the london vaac liaises closely with the icelandic weather service , which is in close contact with the nordic volcano institute .
the data the center collects comes from seismic surveys carried out by the nordic institute , eyewitness accounts of current volcanic activity and from analyses of satellite pictures. ng -lrb- based on information from the british met office -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.04.2010 benedict xvi 's papacy five years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have called on the pope to step down during his five years as pope , benedict xvi has lost the support of many , including catholics in his german homeland .
dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

but thousands of troops , some armed with machine guns , barred their way with the help of barbed wire and metal barricades .
demonstrations by tens of thousands of reds , mostly supporters of exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who come from the impoverished rural north of thailand , have paralyzed parts of bangkok for the last five weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire on monday doubts about clampdown the government has refused to say whether a clampdown against the protests is imminent .
so far , the security forces have not been very efficient in dealing with the protests .
last friday , they failed to arrest several of the red movement 's leaders in a bungled operation .
tv pictures showing a red leader climbing out of a window to escape were widely seen as a complete humiliation for the authorities .
the government responded to this public relations disaster by putting army chief general anupong paochinda in charge of national security .
but the situation could explode at any time .
just nine days ago , an attempted crackdown led to clashes that left 25 people dead in thailand 's worst civil unrest for decades .
observers doubt whether the army and police really are willing to crush the demonstrations .
it is believed that there is a lot of support for thaksin and the red shirts amongst the lower ranks in both organisations .
thaksin himself is a former policeman .
on monday , he told reuters in an interview that the only way to end the current standoff was for the thai government to step down and call premature elections .

during a meeting on sunday , they gave the government an ultimatum of seven days to restore order .

but thousands of troops , some armed with machine guns , barred their way with the help of barbed wire and metal barricades .
demonstrations by tens of thousands of reds , mostly supporters of exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who come from the impoverished rural north of thailand , have paralyzed parts of bangkok for the last five weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire on monday doubts about clampdown the government has refused to say whether a clampdown against the protests is imminent .
so far , the security forces have not been very efficient in dealing with the protests .
last friday , they failed to arrest several of the red movement 's leaders in a bungled operation .
tv pictures showing a red leader climbing out of a window to escape were widely seen as a complete humiliation for the authorities .
the government responded to this public relations disaster by putting army chief general anupong paochinda in charge of national security .
but the situation could explode at any time .
just nine days ago , an attempted crackdown led to clashes that left 25 people dead in thailand 's worst civil unrest for decades .
observers doubt whether the army and police really are willing to crush the demonstrations .
it is believed that there is a lot of support for thaksin and the red shirts amongst the lower ranks in both organisations .
thaksin himself is a former policeman .
on monday , he told reuters in an interview that the only way to end the current standoff was for the thai government to step down and call premature elections .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .
the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted on wednesday april 14 , spewing clouds of ash up to 10,000 meters -lrb- 32,810 feet -rrb- into the air .
the ash plume has resulted in tens of thousands of cancelled flights in and out of european airspace .

shashi tharoor is accused of lobbying for a 330 million dollar bid for a new cricket franchise in the indian premier league or ipl . it all started with a tweet .
almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .
but the issue attracted a lot of media attention and sparked protests from the opposition parties , who demanded his resignation . political expert mahesh rangarajan says the incident had threatened to cast a shadow on the ruling party and the government , which had no option left but to ask tharoor to resign . " personal lives of indian politicians have almost never been a subject of media attention .
but when there are personal relationships with individuals who also happen to have business interests and the minister appears to have played a role in promoting those interests and is unable to even convince his own party and government leadership that they should defend him , then obviously he has crossed the line . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tharoor has a large twitter following controversial political career following his long career as a un diplomat , scholar and author , 54 year old tharoor stood in the national poll last year .
he became the mp for the well-known thiruvananthapuram constituency in the southern indian state of kerala . tharoor , seen as a reformist politician , became one of the first few leaders to use social networking sites such as twitter to put his message across to a mass audience .
his outspoken and at times controversial tweets , which also included remarks about his own government 's policies , earned him not just a large number of twitter followers , but also a host of critics . his remarks also sparked debate about how far politicians should go in the public domain and where should they draw the line .
expert rangarajan says , " it is not the fact that tharoor twitters , but some times the kind of language that he used which got him into controversy .
and this time , i think it was a serious error of judgement . " ipl probe tharoor 's associate sunanda pushkar has meanwhile surrendered her stake in the new franchise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood stars and billionaire entrepreneurs are among the ipl 's franchise owners but the case seems to have opened a veritable pandora 's box .
the opposition parties claim the indian premier league itself is a front for illicit gambling .
the government says it has launched an investigation into the matter .
indian finance minister pranab mukherjee addressed parliament on monday .
" i can assure all honorable members that all aspects of ipl including its sources of funding and how these funds were routed and invested will be looked into , " said mukherjee .
" no wrong-doers will be spared . " ipl chief lalit modi has also come under scrutiny .
tax officials have already visited ipl offices in mumbai and questioned modi , who denies all the allegations , calling them an " attempt to discredit the indian premier league .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .
nato mission remains unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of seven soldiers has reignited the debate about the mission the attack , and the subsequent revelations that many civilians were among the 142 dead , triggered a wide debate in germany .
the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
the inquiry is focusing on whether the government has been transparent about the events in kunduz or whether there have been attempts to cover up possible wrongdoing by german officers .
a surge of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , and the death of seven soldiers over the last two weeks , have also reignited the controversy over whether the germany military should be part of the nato mission .
a memorial service for four german soldiers killed last week is scheduled for thursday and a government spokesman has announced that chancellor angela merkel will take part .
she is expected to reconfirm the government 's commitment to and support of the troops in afghanistan .
the announcement of the suspension of the investigation into colonel klein was welcomed by defense minister guttenberg .

lufthansa spokesman jan baerwald said monday that the first flights would be from the far east , with others following from africa and north america .
he said the planes would start to get ready immediately and would fly to frankfurt , munich and duesseldorf .
lufthansa and the country 's second largest airline air berlin have also restarted a limited number of shorter flights to popular holiday destinations , where thousands of people are still stranded due to grounded flights and closed airports as a cloud of volcano ashes makes its way across europe . the lufthansa spokesman said the permission granted by the german aviation authority dfs allowed them to fly by so-called visual flight rules and at a lower altitude than usual .
but as long as air traffic control maintains the restrictions on airspace , baerwald said , " we do n't have the chance to return to our regular schedule . "
the dfs announced earlier on monday that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who had been stranded for days . eu : unsustainable situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long wait for a plane home may soon be over the european union has announced it would facilitate emergency aid for the airlines affected .

" we can not wait until the ash flows just disappear , " transport commissioner siim kallas told a press conference in brussels .

the london center is run by britain 's met office , the country 's national weather service .
the other centers are in toulouse in france , anchorage , alaska , and washington dc in the us , montreal in canada , darwin in australia , wellington in new zealand , tokyo in japan and buenos aires in argentina .
the volcanic ash advisory centers are part of an international system set up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- .
responsibilities the centers analyze and publish observations of volcanic ash from volcano observatories and other organisations , satellites and aircraft in flight .
they also issue warnings and , since the mid 1990s , publish volcanic ash advisory messages , identifying areas of volcanic ash and their predicted movements .
the london center is responsible for monitoring and forecasting the movement of volcanic ash over the united kingdom , iceland and the north-eastern part of the north atlantic ocean .
although this is a relatively small area , it includes some of the busiest airways in the world .
as millions of stranded passengers have now experienced at first hand , a volcanic eruption in iceland can quickly affect a large area of airspace , as strong winds spread the ash from the volcano .
in such an event , the london vaac liaises closely with the icelandic weather service , which is in close contact with the nordic volcano institute .
the data the center collects comes from seismic surveys carried out by the nordic institute , eyewitness accounts of current volcanic activity and from analyses of satellite pictures. ng -lrb- based on information from the british met office -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .
the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted on wednesday april 14 , spewing clouds of ash up to 10,000 meters -lrb- 32,810 feet -rrb- into the air .
the ash plume has resulted in tens of thousands of cancelled flights in and out of european airspace .

shashi tharoor is accused of lobbying for a 330 million dollar bid for a new cricket franchise in the indian premier league or ipl . it all started with a tweet .
almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .
but the issue attracted a lot of media attention and sparked protests from the opposition parties , who demanded his resignation . political expert mahesh rangarajan says the incident had threatened to cast a shadow on the ruling party and the government , which had no option left but to ask tharoor to resign . " personal lives of indian politicians have almost never been a subject of media attention .
but when there are personal relationships with individuals who also happen to have business interests and the minister appears to have played a role in promoting those interests and is unable to even convince his own party and government leadership that they should defend him , then obviously he has crossed the line . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tharoor has a large twitter following controversial political career following his long career as a un diplomat , scholar and author , 54 year old tharoor stood in the national poll last year .
he became the mp for the well-known thiruvananthapuram constituency in the southern indian state of kerala . tharoor , seen as a reformist politician , became one of the first few leaders to use social networking sites such as twitter to put his message across to a mass audience .
his outspoken and at times controversial tweets , which also included remarks about his own government 's policies , earned him not just a large number of twitter followers , but also a host of critics . his remarks also sparked debate about how far politicians should go in the public domain and where should they draw the line .
expert rangarajan says , " it is not the fact that tharoor twitters , but some times the kind of language that he used which got him into controversy .
and this time , i think it was a serious error of judgement . " ipl probe tharoor 's associate sunanda pushkar has meanwhile surrendered her stake in the new franchise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood stars and billionaire entrepreneurs are among the ipl 's franchise owners but the case seems to have opened a veritable pandora 's box .
the opposition parties claim the indian premier league itself is a front for illicit gambling .
the government says it has launched an investigation into the matter .
indian finance minister pranab mukherjee addressed parliament on monday .
" i can assure all honorable members that all aspects of ipl including its sources of funding and how these funds were routed and invested will be looked into , " said mukherjee .
" no wrong-doers will be spared . " ipl chief lalit modi has also come under scrutiny .
tax officials have already visited ipl offices in mumbai and questioned modi , who denies all the allegations , calling them an " attempt to discredit the indian premier league .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.04.2010 benedict xvi 's papacy five years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have called on the pope to step down during his five years as pope , benedict xvi has lost the support of many , including catholics in his german homeland .
dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .

but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .
" the education system here does n't really teach what happened . i think the film will help educate people not only about no gun ri , but about the war in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and south korean soldiers conducting joint military exercises .
some say the film may trigger resentment toward the us soldiers still based in the country looking back into history journalist choe sang-hun is co-author of a book on the no gun ri incident . he says until recently , if koreans complained about war-time atrocities carried out by allied forces , they were called north korean sympathizers .
choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .
anti-american ?
a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .
nato mission remains unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of seven soldiers has reignited the debate about the mission the attack , and the subsequent revelations that many civilians were among the 142 dead , triggered a wide debate in germany .
the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
the inquiry is focusing on whether the government has been transparent about the events in kunduz or whether there have been attempts to cover up possible wrongdoing by german officers .
a surge of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , and the death of seven soldiers over the last two weeks , have also reignited the controversy over whether the germany military should be part of the nato mission .
a memorial service for four german soldiers killed last week is scheduled for thursday and a government spokesman has announced that chancellor angela merkel will take part .
she is expected to reconfirm the government 's commitment to and support of the troops in afghanistan .
the announcement of the suspension of the investigation into colonel klein was welcomed by defense minister guttenberg .
he said it provided " the greatest possible legal security " for german soldiers in afghanistan. ai / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .
nato mission remains unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of seven soldiers has reignited the debate about the mission the attack , and the subsequent revelations that many civilians were among the 142 dead , triggered a wide debate in germany .
the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
the inquiry is focusing on whether the government has been transparent about the events in kunduz or whether there have been attempts to cover up possible wrongdoing by german officers .
a surge of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , and the death of seven soldiers over the last two weeks , have also reignited the controversy over whether the germany military should be part of the nato mission .
a memorial service for four german soldiers killed last week is scheduled for thursday and a government spokesman has announced that chancellor angela merkel will take part .
she is expected to reconfirm the government 's commitment to and support of the troops in afghanistan .
the announcement of the suspension of the investigation into colonel klein was welcomed by defense minister guttenberg .
he said it provided " the greatest possible legal security " for german soldiers in afghanistan. ai / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .

spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .

but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .

writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .

but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .
" the education system here does n't really teach what happened . i think the film will help educate people not only about no gun ri , but about the war in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and south korean soldiers conducting joint military exercises .
some say the film may trigger resentment toward the us soldiers still based in the country looking back into history journalist choe sang-hun is co-author of a book on the no gun ri incident . he says until recently , if koreans complained about war-time atrocities carried out by allied forces , they were called north korean sympathizers .
choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .
anti-american ?
a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.04.2010 signs are growing that striker kuranyi will get germany recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi hopes he 's headed to south africa germany national coach joachim loew probably will have to take black sheep kevin kuranyi along to the world cup in south africa .
but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

we are praying that the air clears up soon ... very soon . - diana , us i am one of about 100 people stranded in bangkok on a flight from ho chi minh city to frankfurt and onward flights to destinations in europe and north africa .
we are all yearning for forecasts of how long the different airports will be closed and at what time decisions about the reopening will be taken at those airports .
it would be great if deutsche welle could regularly broadcast an info chart with this information on tv and on their website . - karl h. hergarten , germany the airspace closures appear to originate with bureaucrats applying the precautionary principle on the basis of the ba 009 event -lsb- june 1982 , a british airways 747 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of mount galunggung , indonesia , resulting in the temporary failure of all four engines - ed -rsb- i believe there is a need to base decisions on engineering and scientific information instead .
we need to know what the vulnerability of each aircraft type really is , relative to various -lrb- low -rrb- levels of ash concentration .
and we also need to know what the actual concentrations and nature of contaminants are .
piston engine aircraft , which have intake air filtration , possibly are no more vulnerable to low levels of contamination than cars and trucks are .
historically jets have routinely operated in low level sand and ash contamination conditions without problems other than potentially accelerated wear .
we know high levels of ash are a big no-no .
no question about that .
but we need to know what the real boundaries are relating to low levels .
so , more should be done to rigorously investigate the danger .
and it needs to be carried out urgently to avoid major job losses . - martin geliot , germany i work at sfo and see all major european airlines aircraft parked at the edge of the terminal and i see some people are kinda camping out in the food courts .
this will cause lasting problems for weeks after the ash cloud settles . - michael ray peterson , us people i know are having problems with their travel plans .
a growing concern is the health issues related to the ash cloud . - eugene markow , poland compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.04.2010 a korean film about a forgotten massacre großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yang hae chan , a survivor of the no gun ri massacre not many people have heard of the alleged massacre that took place in the south korean village of no gun ri .
but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .
" the education system here does n't really teach what happened . i think the film will help educate people not only about no gun ri , but about the war in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and south korean soldiers conducting joint military exercises .
some say the film may trigger resentment toward the us soldiers still based in the country looking back into history journalist choe sang-hun is co-author of a book on the no gun ri incident . he says until recently , if koreans complained about war-time atrocities carried out by allied forces , they were called north korean sympathizers .
choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .
anti-american ?
a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

last friday , they failed to arrest several of the red movement 's leaders in a bungled operation .
tv pictures showing a red leader climbing out of a window to escape were widely seen as a complete humiliation for the authorities .
the government responded to this public relations disaster by putting army chief general anupong paochinda in charge of national security .
but the situation could explode at any time .
just nine days ago , an attempted crackdown led to clashes that left 25 people dead in thailand 's worst civil unrest for decades .
observers doubt whether the army and police really are willing to crush the demonstrations .
it is believed that there is a lot of support for thaksin and the red shirts amongst the lower ranks in both organisations .
thaksin himself is a former policeman .
on monday , he told reuters in an interview that the only way to end the current standoff was for the thai government to step down and call premature elections .

during a meeting on sunday , they gave the government an ultimatum of seven days to restore order .
the yellow shirts , belonging to the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- , brought down two pro-thaksin governments in 2008 with their months-long street protests , eventually paving the way for the current government of abhisit vejjajiva to come to power. tb / reuters / afp editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government responded to this public relations disaster by putting army chief general anupong paochinda in charge of national security .
but the situation could explode at any time .
just nine days ago , an attempted crackdown led to clashes that left 25 people dead in thailand 's worst civil unrest for decades .
observers doubt whether the army and police really are willing to crush the demonstrations .
it is believed that there is a lot of support for thaksin and the red shirts amongst the lower ranks in both organisations .
thaksin himself is a former policeman .
on monday , he told reuters in an interview that the only way to end the current standoff was for the thai government to step down and call premature elections .

" red " meanwhile , anti-thaksin " yellow shirts " have threatened to take to the streets themselves if the government fails to deal effectively with the red shirts , raising fears of a violent confrontation .
during a meeting on sunday , they gave the government an ultimatum of seven days to restore order .
the yellow shirts , belonging to the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- , brought down two pro-thaksin governments in 2008 with their months-long street protests , eventually paving the way for the current government of abhisit vejjajiva to come to power. tb / reuters / afp editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his outspoken and at times controversial tweets , which also included remarks about his own government 's policies , earned him not just a large number of twitter followers , but also a host of critics . his remarks also sparked debate about how far politicians should go in the public domain and where should they draw the line .

" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .

" the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 19.04.2010 play in pope 's former diocese confronts the topic of child abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play 's intensity has a powerful effect on the audience as stories of children molested by priests continue to rock germany , an intense play on the subject looks at how the lives of both victims and offenders can be affected by such incidents . in the small , 88-seat turmtheater in the german city of regensburg , a man clutching a sleeping young boy frantically bursts onto the stage , beginning the tense , hour-long drama " the confession . " the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .

in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.04.2010 benedict xvi 's papacy five years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have called on the pope to step down during his five years as pope , benedict xvi has lost the support of many , including catholics in his german homeland .
dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 19.04.2010 tharoor quits over cricket corruption claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor became an mp in 2009 india 's junior foreign minister has stepped down amid allegations of corruption .
shashi tharoor is accused of lobbying for a 330 million dollar bid for a new cricket franchise in the indian premier league or ipl . it all started with a tweet .
almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .
but the issue attracted a lot of media attention and sparked protests from the opposition parties , who demanded his resignation . political expert mahesh rangarajan says the incident had threatened to cast a shadow on the ruling party and the government , which had no option left but to ask tharoor to resign . " personal lives of indian politicians have almost never been a subject of media attention .
but when there are personal relationships with individuals who also happen to have business interests and the minister appears to have played a role in promoting those interests and is unable to even convince his own party and government leadership that they should defend him , then obviously he has crossed the line . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tharoor has a large twitter following controversial political career following his long career as a un diplomat , scholar and author , 54 year old tharoor stood in the national poll last year .
he became the mp for the well-known thiruvananthapuram constituency in the southern indian state of kerala . tharoor , seen as a reformist politician , became one of the first few leaders to use social networking sites such as twitter to put his message across to a mass audience .
his outspoken and at times controversial tweets , which also included remarks about his own government 's policies , earned him not just a large number of twitter followers , but also a host of critics . his remarks also sparked debate about how far politicians should go in the public domain and where should they draw the line .
expert rangarajan says , " it is not the fact that tharoor twitters , but some times the kind of language that he used which got him into controversy .
and this time , i think it was a serious error of judgement . " ipl probe tharoor 's associate sunanda pushkar has meanwhile surrendered her stake in the new franchise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood stars and billionaire entrepreneurs are among the ipl 's franchise owners but the case seems to have opened a veritable pandora 's box .
the opposition parties claim the indian premier league itself is a front for illicit gambling .
the government says it has launched an investigation into the matter .

almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .
but the issue attracted a lot of media attention and sparked protests from the opposition parties , who demanded his resignation . political expert mahesh rangarajan says the incident had threatened to cast a shadow on the ruling party and the government , which had no option left but to ask tharoor to resign . " personal lives of indian politicians have almost never been a subject of media attention .

his outspoken and at times controversial tweets , which also included remarks about his own government 's policies , earned him not just a large number of twitter followers , but also a host of critics . his remarks also sparked debate about how far politicians should go in the public domain and where should they draw the line .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.04.2010 signs are growing that striker kuranyi will get germany recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi hopes he 's headed to south africa germany national coach joachim loew probably will have to take black sheep kevin kuranyi along to the world cup in south africa .
but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 19.04.2010 tharoor quits over cricket corruption claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor became an mp in 2009 india 's junior foreign minister has stepped down amid allegations of corruption .
shashi tharoor is accused of lobbying for a 330 million dollar bid for a new cricket franchise in the indian premier league or ipl . it all started with a tweet .
almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .
but the issue attracted a lot of media attention and sparked protests from the opposition parties , who demanded his resignation . political expert mahesh rangarajan says the incident had threatened to cast a shadow on the ruling party and the government , which had no option left but to ask tharoor to resign . " personal lives of indian politicians have almost never been a subject of media attention .
but when there are personal relationships with individuals who also happen to have business interests and the minister appears to have played a role in promoting those interests and is unable to even convince his own party and government leadership that they should defend him , then obviously he has crossed the line . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tharoor has a large twitter following controversial political career following his long career as a un diplomat , scholar and author , 54 year old tharoor stood in the national poll last year .
he became the mp for the well-known thiruvananthapuram constituency in the southern indian state of kerala . tharoor , seen as a reformist politician , became one of the first few leaders to use social networking sites such as twitter to put his message across to a mass audience .
his outspoken and at times controversial tweets , which also included remarks about his own government 's policies , earned him not just a large number of twitter followers , but also a host of critics . his remarks also sparked debate about how far politicians should go in the public domain and where should they draw the line .
expert rangarajan says , " it is not the fact that tharoor twitters , but some times the kind of language that he used which got him into controversy .
and this time , i think it was a serious error of judgement . " ipl probe tharoor 's associate sunanda pushkar has meanwhile surrendered her stake in the new franchise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood stars and billionaire entrepreneurs are among the ipl 's franchise owners but the case seems to have opened a veritable pandora 's box .
the opposition parties claim the indian premier league itself is a front for illicit gambling .
the government says it has launched an investigation into the matter .
indian finance minister pranab mukherjee addressed parliament on monday .
" i can assure all honorable members that all aspects of ipl including its sources of funding and how these funds were routed and invested will be looked into , " said mukherjee .
" no wrong-doers will be spared . " ipl chief lalit modi has also come under scrutiny .
tax officials have already visited ipl offices in mumbai and questioned modi , who denies all the allegations , calling them an " attempt to discredit the indian premier league .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 19.04.2010 merkel praises scale of innovation at hanover trade fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was rather taken with this robot at the hanover fair despite the enormous volcanic ash cloud over europe preventing hundreds of exhibitors from making it to hanover , the world 's largest exhibition of industrial technology is expecting to have its best year ever . chancellor angela merkel was supposed to be joined by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi at the ceremony to kick off this year 's hanover fair .
however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .

that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .

“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .
nato mission remains unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of seven soldiers has reignited the debate about the mission the attack , and the subsequent revelations that many civilians were among the 142 dead , triggered a wide debate in germany .
the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .

however , eu transport ministers are to discuss the possible reopening of airspace . the german aviation authority , dfs , announced that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who have been stranded for days . the closure of airspace over germany and much of europe is costing the airline industry millions of dollars .
however , european union officials say they are optimistic that much of the airspace above the continent will soon reopen .
only a fifth of flights took to the air on sunday , but some say this figure could rise to a half on monday .
spain , which holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , has organised a telephone conference of eu transport ministers to assess the situation and has ordered a full study into the economic impact created by the volcanic ash .
a senior eu official said the current situation was not sustainable .
" we can not wait until the ash flows just disappear , " said transport commissioner siim kallas .
speaking at a press conference in brussels , he added that he hoped that 50 percent of european airspace would be risk-free on monday .
test flights clear pressure to lift the no-fly zone has been strongest from european airlines , which have launched flights to gather information about the danger of the volcanic cloud damaging jet engines .

" the conditions were perfect and the aircraft encountered no difficulties , " a british airways spokesman said , though the jumbo jet used was going in for tests and data analysis .
a grouping of the continent 's 36 major carriers called on governments for an " immediate reassessment " of the restrictions , saying they were having a " devastating impact " on the industry .
they questioned whether the measures taken were proportionate .
" airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly , " the association of european airlines said .
" it is what our passengers demand of us . "
europe at a standstill about 30 countries have closed or restricted their airspace due to passenger safety fears , catching 6.8 million passengers in a global backlog , according to the international airports council , aci .
" more than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far and european airports have lost close to 136 million euros -lrb- 183 million dollars -rrb- , " said its european head olivier jankovec .
a total of 313 airports had been paralysed by the restrictions , he added. cb / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lufthansa spokesman jan baerwald said monday that the first flights would be from the far east , with others following from africa and north america .
he said the planes would start to get ready immediately and would fly to frankfurt , munich and duesseldorf .
lufthansa and the country 's second largest airline air berlin have also restarted a limited number of shorter flights to popular holiday destinations , where thousands of people are still stranded due to grounded flights and closed airports as a cloud of volcano ashes makes its way across europe . the lufthansa spokesman said the permission granted by the german aviation authority dfs allowed them to fly by so-called visual flight rules and at a lower altitude than usual .
but as long as air traffic control maintains the restrictions on airspace , baerwald said , " we do n't have the chance to return to our regular schedule . "
the dfs announced earlier on monday that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who had been stranded for days . eu : unsustainable situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long wait for a plane home may soon be over the european union has announced it would facilitate emergency aid for the airlines affected .

but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

however , eu transport ministers are to discuss the possible reopening of airspace . the german aviation authority , dfs , announced that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who have been stranded for days . the closure of airspace over germany and much of europe is costing the airline industry millions of dollars .
however , european union officials say they are optimistic that much of the airspace above the continent will soon reopen .
only a fifth of flights took to the air on sunday , but some say this figure could rise to a half on monday .
spain , which holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , has organised a telephone conference of eu transport ministers to assess the situation and has ordered a full study into the economic impact created by the volcanic ash .
a senior eu official said the current situation was not sustainable .
" we can not wait until the ash flows just disappear , " said transport commissioner siim kallas .
speaking at a press conference in brussels , he added that he hoped that 50 percent of european airspace would be risk-free on monday .
test flights clear pressure to lift the no-fly zone has been strongest from european airlines , which have launched flights to gather information about the danger of the volcanic cloud damaging jet engines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa is pushing for the ban to be lifted after successful test flights germany 's flag carrier , lufthansa , air france , british airways , and dutch carrier klm have so far reported no problems .
" the conditions were perfect and the aircraft encountered no difficulties , " a british airways spokesman said , though the jumbo jet used was going in for tests and data analysis .
a grouping of the continent 's 36 major carriers called on governments for an " immediate reassessment " of the restrictions , saying they were having a " devastating impact " on the industry .
they questioned whether the measures taken were proportionate .
" airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly , " the association of european airlines said .
" it is what our passengers demand of us . "
europe at a standstill about 30 countries have closed or restricted their airspace due to passenger safety fears , catching 6.8 million passengers in a global backlog , according to the international airports council , aci .
" more than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far and european airports have lost close to 136 million euros -lrb- 183 million dollars -rrb- , " said its european head olivier jankovec .
a total of 313 airports had been paralysed by the restrictions , he added. cb / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .
" the education system here does n't really teach what happened . i think the film will help educate people not only about no gun ri , but about the war in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and south korean soldiers conducting joint military exercises .
some say the film may trigger resentment toward the us soldiers still based in the country looking back into history journalist choe sang-hun is co-author of a book on the no gun ri incident . he says until recently , if koreans complained about war-time atrocities carried out by allied forces , they were called north korean sympathizers .
choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .
anti-american ?
a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .

choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .
anti-american ?
a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 19.04.2010 volcanic ash is too hot to handle : insurers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eyjafjallajokull volcano has grounded thousands of flights ouch .
airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .
the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted on wednesday april 14 , spewing clouds of ash up to 10,000 meters -lrb- 32,810 feet -rrb- into the air .
the ash plume has resulted in tens of thousands of cancelled flights in and out of european airspace .

but thousands of troops , some armed with machine guns , barred their way with the help of barbed wire and metal barricades .
demonstrations by tens of thousands of reds , mostly supporters of exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who come from the impoverished rural north of thailand , have paralyzed parts of bangkok for the last five weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire on monday doubts about clampdown the government has refused to say whether a clampdown against the protests is imminent .
so far , the security forces have not been very efficient in dealing with the protests .
last friday , they failed to arrest several of the red movement 's leaders in a bungled operation .
tv pictures showing a red leader climbing out of a window to escape were widely seen as a complete humiliation for the authorities .
the government responded to this public relations disaster by putting army chief general anupong paochinda in charge of national security .
but the situation could explode at any time .
just nine days ago , an attempted crackdown led to clashes that left 25 people dead in thailand 's worst civil unrest for decades .
observers doubt whether the army and police really are willing to crush the demonstrations .
it is believed that there is a lot of support for thaksin and the red shirts amongst the lower ranks in both organisations .
thaksin himself is a former policeman .
on monday , he told reuters in an interview that the only way to end the current standoff was for the thai government to step down and call premature elections .

during a meeting on sunday , they gave the government an ultimatum of seven days to restore order .
the yellow shirts , belonging to the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- , brought down two pro-thaksin governments in 2008 with their months-long street protests , eventually paving the way for the current government of abhisit vejjajiva to come to power. tb / reuters / afp editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

only a fifth of flights took to the air on sunday , but some say this figure could rise to a half on monday .
spain , which holds the bloc 's rotating presidency , has organised a telephone conference of eu transport ministers to assess the situation and has ordered a full study into the economic impact created by the volcanic ash .
a senior eu official said the current situation was not sustainable .
" we can not wait until the ash flows just disappear , " said transport commissioner siim kallas .
speaking at a press conference in brussels , he added that he hoped that 50 percent of european airspace would be risk-free on monday .

a grouping of the continent 's 36 major carriers called on governments for an " immediate reassessment " of the restrictions , saying they were having a " devastating impact " on the industry .
they questioned whether the measures taken were proportionate .
" airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly , " the association of european airlines said .
" it is what our passengers demand of us . "
europe at a standstill about 30 countries have closed or restricted their airspace due to passenger safety fears , catching 6.8 million passengers in a global backlog , according to the international airports council , aci .
" more than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far and european airports have lost close to 136 million euros -lrb- 183 million dollars -rrb- , " said its european head olivier jankovec .
a total of 313 airports had been paralysed by the restrictions , he added. cb / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .

that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .

in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.04.2010 signs are growing that striker kuranyi will get germany recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi hopes he 's headed to south africa germany national coach joachim loew probably will have to take black sheep kevin kuranyi along to the world cup in south africa .
but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

my fiancé is german and his family and friends are flying in to florida for the wedding .
some friends and family were already planning to travel this week and we are literally on the edge of our seats waiting to see if the flight bans will be lifted in dusseldorf and cologne .
it would be such a shame if half of our guests could not make it !
we are praying that the air clears up soon ... very soon . - diana , us i am one of about 100 people stranded in bangkok on a flight from ho chi minh city to frankfurt and onward flights to destinations in europe and north africa .
we are all yearning for forecasts of how long the different airports will be closed and at what time decisions about the reopening will be taken at those airports .
it would be great if deutsche welle could regularly broadcast an info chart with this information on tv and on their website . - karl h. hergarten , germany the airspace closures appear to originate with bureaucrats applying the precautionary principle on the basis of the ba 009 event -lsb- june 1982 , a british airways 747 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of mount galunggung , indonesia , resulting in the temporary failure of all four engines - ed -rsb- i believe there is a need to base decisions on engineering and scientific information instead .
we need to know what the vulnerability of each aircraft type really is , relative to various -lrb- low -rrb- levels of ash concentration .
and we also need to know what the actual concentrations and nature of contaminants are .
piston engine aircraft , which have intake air filtration , possibly are no more vulnerable to low levels of contamination than cars and trucks are .
historically jets have routinely operated in low level sand and ash contamination conditions without problems other than potentially accelerated wear .
we know high levels of ash are a big no-no .
no question about that .
but we need to know what the real boundaries are relating to low levels .
so , more should be done to rigorously investigate the danger .
and it needs to be carried out urgently to avoid major job losses . - martin geliot , germany i work at sfo and see all major european airlines aircraft parked at the edge of the terminal and i see some people are kinda camping out in the food courts .
this will cause lasting problems for weeks after the ash cloud settles . - michael ray peterson , us people i know are having problems with their travel plans .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .
nato mission remains unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of seven soldiers has reignited the debate about the mission the attack , and the subsequent revelations that many civilians were among the 142 dead , triggered a wide debate in germany .
the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
the inquiry is focusing on whether the government has been transparent about the events in kunduz or whether there have been attempts to cover up possible wrongdoing by german officers .
a surge of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , and the death of seven soldiers over the last two weeks , have also reignited the controversy over whether the germany military should be part of the nato mission .
a memorial service for four german soldiers killed last week is scheduled for thursday and a government spokesman has announced that chancellor angela merkel will take part .
she is expected to reconfirm the government 's commitment to and support of the troops in afghanistan .
the announcement of the suspension of the investigation into colonel klein was welcomed by defense minister guttenberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.04.2010 signs are growing that striker kuranyi will get germany recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi hopes he 's headed to south africa germany national coach joachim loew probably will have to take black sheep kevin kuranyi along to the world cup in south africa .
but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .
nato mission remains unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of seven soldiers has reignited the debate about the mission the attack , and the subsequent revelations that many civilians were among the 142 dead , triggered a wide debate in germany .
the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
the inquiry is focusing on whether the government has been transparent about the events in kunduz or whether there have been attempts to cover up possible wrongdoing by german officers .
a surge of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , and the death of seven soldiers over the last two weeks , have also reignited the controversy over whether the germany military should be part of the nato mission .
a memorial service for four german soldiers killed last week is scheduled for thursday and a government spokesman has announced that chancellor angela merkel will take part .
she is expected to reconfirm the government 's commitment to and support of the troops in afghanistan .
the announcement of the suspension of the investigation into colonel klein was welcomed by defense minister guttenberg .
he said it provided " the greatest possible legal security " for german soldiers in afghanistan. ai / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lufthansa spokesman jan baerwald said monday that the first flights would be from the far east , with others following from africa and north america .
he said the planes would start to get ready immediately and would fly to frankfurt , munich and duesseldorf .
lufthansa and the country 's second largest airline air berlin have also restarted a limited number of shorter flights to popular holiday destinations , where thousands of people are still stranded due to grounded flights and closed airports as a cloud of volcano ashes makes its way across europe . the lufthansa spokesman said the permission granted by the german aviation authority dfs allowed them to fly by so-called visual flight rules and at a lower altitude than usual .
but as long as air traffic control maintains the restrictions on airspace , baerwald said , " we do n't have the chance to return to our regular schedule . "
the dfs announced earlier on monday that the country 's airspace would remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday , dashing the hopes of millions of passengers who had been stranded for days . eu : unsustainable situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long wait for a plane home may soon be over the european union has announced it would facilitate emergency aid for the airlines affected .
eu transport ministers were scheduled to hold a telephone conference on monday afternoon to assess the situation .
" we can not wait until the ash flows just disappear , " transport commissioner siim kallas told a press conference in brussels .
meanwhile , austrian , czech and slovak airspace reopened on monday .
the flight restrictions in place over scottish airspace are to be lifted tuesday morning , and civil aviation authorities say other british airports may also reopen soon .
about 30 countries had closed or restricted their airspace due to passenger safety fears , catching 6.8 million passengers in a global backlog , according to the international airports council aci .
" more than 6.8 million passengers have been affected so far and european airports have lost close to 136 million euros -lrb- 183 million dollars -rrb- , " said olivier jankovec , aci 's european head .
a total of 313 airports had been paralysed by the restrictions , he added. db / dpa / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

" the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .
" the education system here does n't really teach what happened . i think the film will help educate people not only about no gun ri , but about the war in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and south korean soldiers conducting joint military exercises .
some say the film may trigger resentment toward the us soldiers still based in the country looking back into history journalist choe sang-hun is co-author of a book on the no gun ri incident . he says until recently , if koreans complained about war-time atrocities carried out by allied forces , they were called north korean sympathizers .
choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .
anti-american ?
a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .
the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted on wednesday april 14 , spewing clouds of ash up to 10,000 meters -lrb- 32,810 feet -rrb- into the air .
the ash plume has resulted in tens of thousands of cancelled flights in and out of european airspace .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .
on september 4 , 2009 , klein had requested a nato airstrike against the two trucks fearing they would be used to attack a german troop base nearby .
nato mission remains unpopular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recent death of seven soldiers has reignited the debate about the mission the attack , and the subsequent revelations that many civilians were among the 142 dead , triggered a wide debate in germany .
the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
the inquiry is focusing on whether the government has been transparent about the events in kunduz or whether there have been attempts to cover up possible wrongdoing by german officers .
a surge of attacks on german troops in afghanistan , and the death of seven soldiers over the last two weeks , have also reignited the controversy over whether the germany military should be part of the nato mission .
a memorial service for four german soldiers killed last week is scheduled for thursday and a government spokesman has announced that chancellor angela merkel will take part .
she is expected to reconfirm the government 's commitment to and support of the troops in afghanistan .
the announcement of the suspension of the investigation into colonel klein was welcomed by defense minister guttenberg .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .
" on the contrary , after a thorough assessment of the situation , they could assume that there were only insurgents present , " the karlsruhe-based prosecution said in a statement on monday .
colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .

the participation by the bundeswehr in the nato mission in afghanistan is widely unpopular in the country .
the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .

almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .
the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted on wednesday april 14 , spewing clouds of ash up to 10,000 meters -lrb- 32,810 feet -rrb- into the air .
the ash plume has resulted in tens of thousands of cancelled flights in and out of european airspace .

dw-world.de most of europe 's airspace remains closed until monday germany 's airspace will remain closed until monday .
only berlin 's airports will be permitted to operate selected flights overnight as europe remains blanketed by a volcanic ash cloud emanating from iceland .
-lrb- 18.04.2010 -rrb- volcanic ash cloud spreads east , closing more airports iceland 's second volcanic eruption in a month has caused flight delays and cancellations across northern europe as ash and smoke are spewed thousands of meters into the atmosphere .
-lrb- 15.04.2010 -rrb- german airspace closed until tuesday morning germany 's aviation authority has announced that the country 's airspace will remain closed until at least 2 a.m. local time on tuesday .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 19.04.2010 volcanic ash is too hot to handle : insurers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eyjafjallajokull volcano has grounded thousands of flights ouch .
airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .
the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted on wednesday april 14 , spewing clouds of ash up to 10,000 meters -lrb- 32,810 feet -rrb- into the air .
the ash plume has resulted in tens of thousands of cancelled flights in and out of european airspace .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .
spokeswoman sarah robson said that while lloyds does provide insurance coverage against interrupted business operations , the company would need to study the current situation to determine the feasibility of providing coverage for volcano-related disruptions in the future .
mountain of debt reinsurer munich re is already sniffing at an opportunity .
spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .
the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted on wednesday april 14 , spewing clouds of ash up to 10,000 meters -lrb- 32,810 feet -rrb- into the air .
the ash plume has resulted in tens of thousands of cancelled flights in and out of european airspace .

but survivors say that during the korean war , us soldiers killed up to 400 innocent civilians there .
now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .
that 's when they hear the roar of fighter jets and the strafing begins . bodies are scattered across the tracks after the onslaught .
the villagers hide wherever they can , but the soldiers continue firing at them .
only a couple of dozen people survive .
film will educate people seventy-year old yang hae chan is an actual survivor of no gun ri ; he lost 12 family members there .
he says he 's glad the victims ' story is finally being told .
" i do n't think young koreans know much about the war , " yang says .
" the education system here does n't really teach what happened . i think the film will help educate people not only about no gun ri , but about the war in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us and south korean soldiers conducting joint military exercises .
some say the film may trigger resentment toward the us soldiers still based in the country looking back into history journalist choe sang-hun is co-author of a book on the no gun ri incident . he says until recently , if koreans complained about war-time atrocities carried out by allied forces , they were called north korean sympathizers .
choe says the film a little pond , is breaking this taboo .
" i think there is a strong tendency among south koreans , especially conservative south koreans , not to delve too deeply into south korea 's recent , painful history .
any attempt by liberals to look back into south korean history and to focus on the unsavory aspects of the history , is seen by the conservatives as a political smear campaign . "
there is still much debate over whether north korean troops had infiltrated the group of no gun ri villagers or if us soldiers knew they were firing on civilians .
but the film makes it seem pretty clear cut .
anti-american ?
a little pond 's director , lee sang-woo , acknowledges that some might label his film anti-american , but he says that was never his intention . lee says he has no hatred toward us soldiers , but like many koreans , he does have some mixed feelings . he says he only wanted to make a movie that depicts how civilians , like the ones at no gun ri , are often collateral damage during a war . no gun ri survivor yang hae chan hopes korean audiences do n't take home an anti-american message either . " we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

now a new south korean film is depicting the incident . as north korean soldiers advanced southward in the summer of 1950 , many south korean civilians fled their homes .
that 's where the film a little pond picks up .
a few hundred villagers , all dressed in white robes with their belongings strapped to their backs , are traveling along a dirt road through the mountains .
upon reaching no gun ri , they encounter american troops , who bark commands at them in english .
" everyone sit down , do n't move , stop right there and sit down . "
later , the families restart their march along a nearby railroad .

" we victims are not anti-american , " he says .
" we just want the us to explain why they killed so many civilians and just be more honest about what happened . "
yang says he hopes that an official apology will come soon , one no gun ri survivor died just this week and now including himself , there are only twenty left .

the london center is run by britain 's met office , the country 's national weather service .
the other centers are in toulouse in france , anchorage , alaska , and washington dc in the us , montreal in canada , darwin in australia , wellington in new zealand , tokyo in japan and buenos aires in argentina .
the volcanic ash advisory centers are part of an international system set up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- .
responsibilities the centers analyze and publish observations of volcanic ash from volcano observatories and other organisations , satellites and aircraft in flight .
they also issue warnings and , since the mid 1990s , publish volcanic ash advisory messages , identifying areas of volcanic ash and their predicted movements .
the london center is responsible for monitoring and forecasting the movement of volcanic ash over the united kingdom , iceland and the north-eastern part of the north atlantic ocean .
although this is a relatively small area , it includes some of the busiest airways in the world .
as millions of stranded passengers have now experienced at first hand , a volcanic eruption in iceland can quickly affect a large area of airspace , as strong winds spread the ash from the volcano .
in such an event , the london vaac liaises closely with the icelandic weather service , which is in close contact with the nordic volcano institute .
the data the center collects comes from seismic surveys carried out by the nordic institute , eyewitness accounts of current volcanic activity and from analyses of satellite pictures. ng -lrb- based on information from the british met office -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 02 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.04.2010 benedict xvi 's papacy five years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have called on the pope to step down during his five years as pope , benedict xvi has lost the support of many , including catholics in his german homeland .
dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 19.04.2010 play in pope 's former diocese confronts the topic of child abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play 's intensity has a powerful effect on the audience as stories of children molested by priests continue to rock germany , an intense play on the subject looks at how the lives of both victims and offenders can be affected by such incidents . in the small , 88-seat turmtheater in the german city of regensburg , a man clutching a sleeping young boy frantically bursts onto the stage , beginning the tense , hour-long drama " the confession . " the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 19.04.2010 play in pope 's former diocese confronts the topic of child abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play 's intensity has a powerful effect on the audience as stories of children molested by priests continue to rock germany , an intense play on the subject looks at how the lives of both victims and offenders can be affected by such incidents . in the small , 88-seat turmtheater in the german city of regensburg , a man clutching a sleeping young boy frantically bursts onto the stage , beginning the tense , hour-long drama " the confession . " the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .

" the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .

" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

" the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .

" the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 .

the attack killed up to 142 people , many of whom were civilians . german state prosecutors on monday said they had closed the case against colonel klein , the officer who ordered the controversial airstrike near kunduz in september 2009 .
according to the prosecution , neither klein nor any of the other officers present before the attack were in a position to know that there were still civilians at the site at the time of the airstrikes .

colonel klein had , therefore , not acted in violation of either the international or german criminal code , the prosecution said . ordering the airstrike on two fuel trucks that had been hijacked by taliban insurgents did not qualify as an illegal method of warfare .

the kunduz airstrike is also currently the subject of a parliamentary board of inquiry which , in the course of the week , is to question defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 19.04.2010 tharoor quits over cricket corruption claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shashi tharoor became an mp in 2009 india 's junior foreign minister has stepped down amid allegations of corruption .
shashi tharoor is accused of lobbying for a 330 million dollar bid for a new cricket franchise in the indian premier league or ipl . it all started with a tweet .
almost a week ago lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league or ipl revealed details about the ownership of a new cricket league franchise on the social networking site twitter . modi tweeted that junior foreign minister shashi tharoor had helped put together a successful bid for the ipl 's kochi franchise which was bought by a consortium of businesspeople called rendezvous sports world ltd and that a dubai based businesswoman called sunanda pushkar , who is also a friend of shashi tharoor , had a stake in it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lalit modi , the chief of the indian premier league no option but to resign tharoor denied any wrongdoing , insisting he only had helped ' mentoring ' the bid .
but the issue attracted a lot of media attention and sparked protests from the opposition parties , who demanded his resignation . political expert mahesh rangarajan says the incident had threatened to cast a shadow on the ruling party and the government , which had no option left but to ask tharoor to resign . " personal lives of indian politicians have almost never been a subject of media attention .
but when there are personal relationships with individuals who also happen to have business interests and the minister appears to have played a role in promoting those interests and is unable to even convince his own party and government leadership that they should defend him , then obviously he has crossed the line . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tharoor has a large twitter following controversial political career following his long career as a un diplomat , scholar and author , 54 year old tharoor stood in the national poll last year .
he became the mp for the well-known thiruvananthapuram constituency in the southern indian state of kerala . tharoor , seen as a reformist politician , became one of the first few leaders to use social networking sites such as twitter to put his message across to a mass audience .
his outspoken and at times controversial tweets , which also included remarks about his own government 's policies , earned him not just a large number of twitter followers , but also a host of critics . his remarks also sparked debate about how far politicians should go in the public domain and where should they draw the line .
expert rangarajan says , " it is not the fact that tharoor twitters , but some times the kind of language that he used which got him into controversy .
and this time , i think it was a serious error of judgement . " ipl probe tharoor 's associate sunanda pushkar has meanwhile surrendered her stake in the new franchise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bollywood stars and billionaire entrepreneurs are among the ipl 's franchise owners but the case seems to have opened a veritable pandora 's box .
the opposition parties claim the indian premier league itself is a front for illicit gambling .
the government says it has launched an investigation into the matter .

the london center is run by britain 's met office , the country 's national weather service .
the other centers are in toulouse in france , anchorage , alaska , and washington dc in the us , montreal in canada , darwin in australia , wellington in new zealand , tokyo in japan and buenos aires in argentina .
the volcanic ash advisory centers are part of an international system set up by the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- .
responsibilities the centers analyze and publish observations of volcanic ash from volcano observatories and other organisations , satellites and aircraft in flight .
they also issue warnings and , since the mid 1990s , publish volcanic ash advisory messages , identifying areas of volcanic ash and their predicted movements .
the london center is responsible for monitoring and forecasting the movement of volcanic ash over the united kingdom , iceland and the north-eastern part of the north atlantic ocean .
although this is a relatively small area , it includes some of the busiest airways in the world .
as millions of stranded passengers have now experienced at first hand , a volcanic eruption in iceland can quickly affect a large area of airspace , as strong winds spread the ash from the volcano .
in such an event , the london vaac liaises closely with the icelandic weather service , which is in close contact with the nordic volcano institute .
the data the center collects comes from seismic surveys carried out by the nordic institute , eyewitness accounts of current volcanic activity and from analyses of satellite pictures. ng -lrb- based on information from the british met office -rrb- editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 19.04.2010 benedict xvi 's papacy five years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have called on the pope to step down during his five years as pope , benedict xvi has lost the support of many , including catholics in his german homeland .
dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .

that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

we 've been planning a vacation to italy for almost a year .
now it seems in jeopardy with this volcanic ash cloud .
as of right now , rome airport is still open .
but who knows for how long ?
we are to depart for rome this coming tuesday night , in 72 hours .
will we be able to ?
we are on pins and needles , and praying to auster , the roman god of the south wind .
let 's hope he huffs and he puffs and he blows that dang cloud away ! - paula , us my husband was stuck in helsinki on thursday .
on saturday , he and his business associate took a ferry to stockholm , then a train to oslo in hopes of flying out to the us on monday .
he is from michigan and is on business .
he sells aircraft parts to european airlines .
he wonders how this disruption and potential future disruption in european air travel will affect his long term business .
if the volcano continues to erupt , it could mean long term delays and disruptions . - daryl , us i 'm from florida and i 'm getting married in about 15 days .
my fiancé is german and his family and friends are flying in to florida for the wedding .
some friends and family were already planning to travel this week and we are literally on the edge of our seats waiting to see if the flight bans will be lifted in dusseldorf and cologne .
it would be such a shame if half of our guests could not make it !
we are praying that the air clears up soon ... very soon . - diana , us i am one of about 100 people stranded in bangkok on a flight from ho chi minh city to frankfurt and onward flights to destinations in europe and north africa .
we are all yearning for forecasts of how long the different airports will be closed and at what time decisions about the reopening will be taken at those airports .
it would be great if deutsche welle could regularly broadcast an info chart with this information on tv and on their website . - karl h. hergarten , germany the airspace closures appear to originate with bureaucrats applying the precautionary principle on the basis of the ba 009 event -lsb- june 1982 , a british airways 747 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of mount galunggung , indonesia , resulting in the temporary failure of all four engines - ed -rsb- i believe there is a need to base decisions on engineering and scientific information instead .
we need to know what the vulnerability of each aircraft type really is , relative to various -lrb- low -rrb- levels of ash concentration .
and we also need to know what the actual concentrations and nature of contaminants are .
piston engine aircraft , which have intake air filtration , possibly are no more vulnerable to low levels of contamination than cars and trucks are .
historically jets have routinely operated in low level sand and ash contamination conditions without problems other than potentially accelerated wear .
we know high levels of ash are a big no-no .
no question about that .
but we need to know what the real boundaries are relating to low levels .
so , more should be done to rigorously investigate the danger .
and it needs to be carried out urgently to avoid major job losses . - martin geliot , germany i work at sfo and see all major european airlines aircraft parked at the edge of the terminal and i see some people are kinda camping out in the food courts .
this will cause lasting problems for weeks after the ash cloud settles . - michael ray peterson , us people i know are having problems with their travel plans .
a growing concern is the health issues related to the ash cloud . - eugene markow , poland compiled by stuart tiffen editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .

in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .

that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .

at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .

writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .

" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .

but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .
the black sheep could then be the one that bleats last and best .

airlines are n't insured against business interruptions such as those caused by the cloud of volcanic ash from iceland , which has grounded aircraft in europe and resulted in huge financial losses . as if airlines did n't have enough problems : first the volcanic ash cloud being blown south from iceland grounds thousands of european flights over a period of days .
now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .
“ no insurer is willing to take that risk , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airplanes at european airports have been grounded for days not even lloyds of london , which is known to insure just about anything if the price is right , will provide coverage against volcanic ash – at least for now .

spokesman klaus schmidtke said the company is considering offering a “ cancellation insurance ” if the crisis creates sufficient demand .
“ this is something we 're studying right now , ” he said .
“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : major airlines like lufthansa are not insured against volcanic business interruptions lufthansa is n't insured german airline lufthansa confirmed that it was n't insured against any loss of revenue caused by the volcanic disruption .
and a spokeswoman declined to say whether the airline would consider seeking such coverage in the future .
“ at the moment , our entire focus is on normalizing air traffic , ” she said .
analysts point out that european airlines will likely have to cover the lost revenue themselves .
most governments in the region have exhausted funds bailing out banks and large manufacturers and financing employment programs aimed at limiting the impact of the global economic downturn .
reinsurance companies such as hannover re , munich re and swiss re , which act as a backstop to insurance companies , say they do not expect disruptions in the airline sector will have any impact on their operations .

now insurers say carriers ca n't file claims for lost revenue because their policies do n't cover business interruptions .
the expensive nature of such insurance means most airlines wo n't be able to afford such protection in the future either .
no one can say how long the volcano under iceland 's eyjafjallajokull glacier will continue to erupt .
in the early 1800s , a volcano in the country poured ash into the air for more than two years .
concerns are also growing that a larger , neighboring volcano could soon become active , too .
" airlines could theoretically insure themselves " aviation insurance typically covers physical damage to planes and the consequences of a plane crash caused , for example , by volcanic ash , according to christoph groffy , a spokesman for the hanover-based hdi-gerling insurance group . “ airlines could theoretically insure themselves -lrb- against business disruptions such as volcanic ash clouds -rrb- but it 's simply not affordable , ” he told deutsche welle .
and even if airlines had the funds to insure themselves against a business interruption such as volcanic ash , they would struggle to find an insurance company willing to take their money , according to groffy .
ash clouds can drift across a huge area , affecting not only local airlines but also connecting flights to other parts of the world , he noted .

“ of course , one of the big questions is what customers are willing to pay for such coverage . ”
that is a huge question .
airlines have little financial breathing space .
many of them are sitting on a mountain of debt caused by sharp drops in air travel after the september 11 terrorist attacks , the internet and real estate bubbles , and , more recently , the global economic crises . the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- estimates that airlines are losing about 150 million euros -lrb- $ 202 million -rrb- a day in the shutdown , which has caused chaos far beyond the immediate european airspace .

but thousands of troops , some armed with machine guns , barred their way with the help of barbed wire and metal barricades .
demonstrations by tens of thousands of reds , mostly supporters of exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who come from the impoverished rural north of thailand , have paralyzed parts of bangkok for the last five weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire on monday doubts about clampdown the government has refused to say whether a clampdown against the protests is imminent .
so far , the security forces have not been very efficient in dealing with the protests .
last friday , they failed to arrest several of the red movement 's leaders in a bungled operation .
tv pictures showing a red leader climbing out of a window to escape were widely seen as a complete humiliation for the authorities .
the government responded to this public relations disaster by putting army chief general anupong paochinda in charge of national security .
but the situation could explode at any time .
just nine days ago , an attempted crackdown led to clashes that left 25 people dead in thailand 's worst civil unrest for decades .
observers doubt whether the army and police really are willing to crush the demonstrations .
it is believed that there is a lot of support for thaksin and the red shirts amongst the lower ranks in both organisations .
thaksin himself is a former policeman .
on monday , he told reuters in an interview that the only way to end the current standoff was for the thai government to step down and call premature elections .

" red " meanwhile , anti-thaksin " yellow shirts " have threatened to take to the streets themselves if the government fails to deal effectively with the red shirts , raising fears of a violent confrontation .
during a meeting on sunday , they gave the government an ultimatum of seven days to restore order .
the yellow shirts , belonging to the people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- , brought down two pro-thaksin governments in 2008 with their months-long street protests , eventually paving the way for the current government of abhisit vejjajiva to come to power. tb / reuters / afp editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de theater -pipe- 19.04.2010 play in pope 's former diocese confronts the topic of child abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the play 's intensity has a powerful effect on the audience as stories of children molested by priests continue to rock germany , an intense play on the subject looks at how the lives of both victims and offenders can be affected by such incidents . in the small , 88-seat turmtheater in the german city of regensburg , a man clutching a sleeping young boy frantically bursts onto the stage , beginning the tense , hour-long drama " the confession . " the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .

rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 .

grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .

" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .

they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 .

so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .

the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

" the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .
" you can almost reach out and touch it from here . " dramaturge bernau said her idea in putting on the play was to give a voice to those people who needed one . " we just wanted to tell the story because the victims constantly experience being forced into silence , " said bernau .
" there have been cases where some kind of financial compensation for the pain and suffering has been made , but this then quickly becomes a hush-money agreement .
you 'll get compensation but you 're never allowed to speak about these things publicly . " " this sentences the victim once again to a punishment of silence and sends him to back to this psychological prison - and this is what we want to scream out about , " she added . ripping off the cloak of silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : local cathedral officials have not commented on the play the regensburg community wants this scream to be heard , and several of the final performances of " the confession " were completely sold out , despite the difficult themes in the play . throughout the one-hour performance , martin and father eberhard are in conflict , verbally as well as physically .
they climb under , over and on top of a giant wooden cross that diagonally bisects the stage as accusations fly and a sad story is told . it is an intense , uncomfortable experience for audience members like 29-year-old thomas rother .
rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .
but the church reform organization wir sind kirche -lrb- we are the church -rrb- has been concerned with these issues since 1995 . " never before has sexual abuse been such a theme in public , and speaking about what has happened to the victims , " said the group 's founder , sigrid grabmeier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grabmeier believes discussing abuse cases is important in 2002 , wir sind kirche started a hotline for victims of abuse by priests .
so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .
i think that all the bishops and a lot of people should see it . " " the confession " ended its current run but there will be another chance to see it in regensburg soon .

rother is catholic , and is not happy with his church 's response to allegations of abuse . " it 's a difficult topic with the church , " said rother .
" i think true belief and the church can not always be linked . but what i find difficult is the cloak of silence - it seems like they 'd rather cloak the whole issue in silence than find out the truth .
that 's what has disappointed me about the church . " rother hopes that the media will continue to cover the issue after the scandal dies down . stories of abuse have dominated the media of late , with almost daily reports of physical or sexual misconduct seemingly the norm .

so far , more than 400 people have called - at least 100 in just the last two months .
grabmeier is a bit worried that the topic might soon suffer from overexposure , and people will cease to care about it . but generally she welcomes the continuing media coverage and theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession , " for which she served as an adviser . she believes public discussion of abuse , and any discomfort it brings , could be a necessary agent for change .
as an example , she cites the fact that germany 's catholic church opened its own telephone hotline earlier this month and received thousands of calls in only a few days . " if our society needs the pain , then this play may be hurtful and helpful , " said grabmeier .
" and i hope that they 'll play it on many stages in germany - not only here in regensburg .

" the man is martin , played by actor michael haake .
as an orphan under church care , martin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of a priest , and he has started abusing his own son , sebastian .
he has decided the only way out is for them both to die , after he confronts the man who was both comforter and tormentor - father eberhard , performed by actor miko greza . but in a line that provokes gasps and uncomfortable laughter from the audience , father eberhard declares that many children have experienced this and grown up to be perfectly normal adults .
" i ask myself : what 's so terrible about it ? " he says . bildunterschrift : the two main characters engage in uncomfortable dialogue that question is becoming more and more relevant , especially in regensburg .
the beautiful historic town in southern bavaria was once pope benedict 's diocese , and his brother georg ratzinger was the leader of the city 's famed boys ' choir for decades . the well-regarded domspatzen , or regensburg cathedral choir , became the target of unwanted attention in march , when charges of abuse in the 1970s and 1980s surfaced concerning boarding schools tied to the choir .
none of the accusations relate to georg ratzinger , who has said he was unaware of such incidents . the diocese has encouraged victims to come forward , but regensburg 's bishop has focused his critiques on media coverage of the scandal , rather than on any church wrongdoings . the right play at the right time theater regensburg 's staging of " the confession " -lrb- die beichte -rrb- started its run in february , a week before ash wednesday .
it closed right before easter .
however , according to chief dramaturge friederike bernau , it had already been discussed by the staff for years . " the confession " was written by austrian writer felix mitterer , inspired by events in ireland . it was first performed in 2003 as a radio play .
theater regensburg added it to the schedule more than a year ago , and the play had its premiere around the same time as revelations about abuse in germany came to light . greza , who plays the priest , says the coincidence of events is forunate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cases of abuse haunt the domspatzen choir " that the right play came at the right time is for us , of course , in terms of our work - a stroke of luck that rarely happens in the theater , " said greza .
" that at exactly this point in time , both nationally and internationally , people had the courage to come forth and say : ' this has happened - this has happened to me . " ' greza has received letters from theatergoers who say they appreciated his performance , but were too stunned at the end of the show to applaud .
for its part , st. peter 's cathedral in regensburghas been mum on the subject of the play , despite its close proximity - it is just steps away from the theater . " maybe you noticed the cathedral - it 's very close , " said haake .

readers have sent in their experiences and comments . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
we 've been planning a vacation to italy for almost a year .
now it seems in jeopardy with this volcanic ash cloud .
as of right now , rome airport is still open .
but who knows for how long ?
we are to depart for rome this coming tuesday night , in 72 hours .
will we be able to ?
we are on pins and needles , and praying to auster , the roman god of the south wind .
let 's hope he huffs and he puffs and he blows that dang cloud away ! - paula , us my husband was stuck in helsinki on thursday .
on saturday , he and his business associate took a ferry to stockholm , then a train to oslo in hopes of flying out to the us on monday .
he is from michigan and is on business .
he sells aircraft parts to european airlines .
he wonders how this disruption and potential future disruption in european air travel will affect his long term business .
if the volcano continues to erupt , it could mean long term delays and disruptions . - daryl , us i 'm from florida and i 'm getting married in about 15 days .
my fiancé is german and his family and friends are flying in to florida for the wedding .
some friends and family were already planning to travel this week and we are literally on the edge of our seats waiting to see if the flight bans will be lifted in dusseldorf and cologne .
it would be such a shame if half of our guests could not make it !
we are praying that the air clears up soon ... very soon . - diana , us i am one of about 100 people stranded in bangkok on a flight from ho chi minh city to frankfurt and onward flights to destinations in europe and north africa .
we are all yearning for forecasts of how long the different airports will be closed and at what time decisions about the reopening will be taken at those airports .
it would be great if deutsche welle could regularly broadcast an info chart with this information on tv and on their website . - karl h. hergarten , germany the airspace closures appear to originate with bureaucrats applying the precautionary principle on the basis of the ba 009 event -lsb- june 1982 , a british airways 747 flew into a cloud of volcanic ash from the eruption of mount galunggung , indonesia , resulting in the temporary failure of all four engines - ed -rsb- i believe there is a need to base decisions on engineering and scientific information instead .
we need to know what the vulnerability of each aircraft type really is , relative to various -lrb- low -rrb- levels of ash concentration .
and we also need to know what the actual concentrations and nature of contaminants are .
piston engine aircraft , which have intake air filtration , possibly are no more vulnerable to low levels of contamination than cars and trucks are .
historically jets have routinely operated in low level sand and ash contamination conditions without problems other than potentially accelerated wear .
we know high levels of ash are a big no-no .
no question about that .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a speech in the pontiff 's native germany angered many muslims " there 's been a series of theologically questionable acts that cast doubt on whether he 's leading the church towards a sustainable catholicism , or ifthis papacy will get caught up in the same backlog of reforms that 's been building up over the past 30 years , " beinert told deutsche welle .
in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .
he later proclaimed in jordan his " deepest respect for the muslim community . "
after lifting williamson 's excommunication , the pope paid a similar visit to the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem .
during his tenure , the pope also approved of a document denying that the protestant church is a church " in the classical sense " - a decision that the lutheran bishop of hanover at the time , margot kaessmann , described as a " fiasco . "
" we are pope ! "
five years ago the announcement that bavarian-born joseph ratzinger would become the first german pope since 1523 , created excitement among germany 's catholics .
their enthusiasm was best expressed in the headline of the mass circulation daily bild : " wir sind papst ! " -lrb- literally , " we are pope ! " -rrb- .
that enthusiasm has waned .
according to the newspaper suedwest presse , after months of new reports of sexual abuse by german clergymen , the freiburg diocese lost 2,711 members in march 2010 alone .
in the same month 2,676 parishioners withdrew their membership in rottenburg-stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands have left the church in germany german clergymen support their leader but acknowledge that the pope has lost favor in his homeland .
" i am ashamed of us german catholics for the way we are treating the pope , " said cardinal joachim meisner , the archbishop of cologne .
the pope , who himself is accused of turning a blind eye to abuse during his tenure as the bishop of munich and freising , has come under widespread criticism in europe for his resistance to take a strong stance on abuse within the church .
in an april 2008 interview , the pope told the us-based television news network that the church should do all it can to help the victims of abuse and that he would " absolutely exclude pedophiles from the sacred ministry . "
however , the pope did not see fit to reaffirm this message to the public when new reports of sexual abuse erupted in europe - another public relations mistake that has cost the church thousands of members .

dw looks back at a papacy wrought with public-relations disasters . in the five years since german cardinal josef ratzinger was elected pope , the papacy has experienced one public relations error after another . pope benedict xvi has led the church into an international crisis of confidence .
although it may not have been his intention , the newly-elected pontiff 's address to the crowd at st. peter 's square on april 19 , 2005 provided an indication that the days of the supposed infallibility of the pope were long gone : " the cardinals elected me , a simple and modest worker in the vineyard of the lord , to follow the great pope john paul ii , " benedict xvi said .
" i am comforted by the fact that the lord knows how to work with even inadequate tools . "
a conservative hardliner no one expected the conservative cardinal joseph ratzinger to become a pope of reform .
in fact , pope benedict xvi has maintained controversial church stances against abortion , contraception , the ordination of women and interfaith marriages - to the chagrin of many liberal catholics .
wolfgang beinert , a regensburg theologian and a former student of ratzinger 's , believes , like many of the pope 's critics , that the church needs an update if it is to survive .

in 2009 , politicians in germany , france and belgium condemned the pope 's claims that condoms could " increase the problem " of hiv-aids in sub-saharan africa .
interfaith miscommunication since becoming pope , ratzinger 's words and actions have alienated not only other catholics , but muslims , jews and even protestants .
the pope provoked violent reactions in the middle east with a reference to emperor manuel ii palaeologus in a 2006 speech in regensburg .
benedict quoted emperor manuel ii as saying , " ' show me just what mohammed brought that was new , and there you will find things only evil and inhuman . " '
following benedict 's speech churches were burned in gaza and an italian nun was murdered in somalia .
the pope also received open letters from 38 muslim leaders across the world .
two years later benedict 's reversal of british holocaust-denier richard williamson 's excommunication prompted an outcry among jews and caused german chancellor angela merkel , to demand that the pope " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denying " that the nazis killed six million jews .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict reversed the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard willliamson in the same year , the pope readopted a pre-vatican council ii version of the good friday prayer for jews , which beseeches god to " illuminate their hearts , that they acknowledge jesus christ is the savior of all men . "
in an attempt to soften the blow of the regensburg address , benedict visited a mufti at the blue mosque in istanbul , where he stressed the common goals of islam and christianity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 19.04.2010 signs are growing that striker kuranyi will get germany recall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi hopes he 's headed to south africa germany national coach joachim loew probably will have to take black sheep kevin kuranyi along to the world cup in south africa .
but that 's no guarantee the schalke striker will see any playing time . never say never - that looks to be the upshot of all the bleating in the spat between loew and kuranyi .
after declaring that the striker had run out of chances to be in the german national team , the coach now seems to be on the verge of giving him one more .
over the weekend , germany commercial manager oliver bierhoff , a loew intimate , gave the clearest indication yet that a recall was in the offing .
" we 're thankful for every player who is in top form , " bierhoff told the kölner stadt-anzeiger newspaper .
" i think we do n't risk losing credibility or face if we reconsider things - in this case kuranyi 's earlier mistake . "
loew , on the contrary , is playing his cards close to the chest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew makes no bones about preferring some players to others " we 'll see - maybe , " was all loew would say to reporters on monday , april 19 , when asked if he planned to speak directly with kuranyi .
in october 2008 , angered at being left out of the squad for germany 's match against russia , kuranyi left the stadium in düsseldorf at half-time and headed home .
an enraged loew immediately declared that the striker would never play for him again .
but it 's hard to imagine bierhoff speaking so frankly , if loew intends to stick by his earlier words .
public pressure , it would seem for the moment , has trumped personal antipathy .
self-proclaimed team player , nice guy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and kuranyi shared the middle of this ad , but have rarely been that close germany 's two established center forwards miroslav klose and mario gomez have been , respectively , dismal and mediocre this season , while kuranyi has been at or near the top of the list of the bundesliga 's leading goal scorers for most of 2009-10 .
that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .
loew only has until may 6 to make up his mind .
at that point , he has to announce his preliminary squad for south africa to football 's governing body , fifa .
capped , then benched ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frings is another player with no love lost for loew but even if loew does recall kuranyi , it may be just a tactical maneuver vis-a-vis the press and not a sign of genuine reconciliation .
loew has repeatedly indicated he will stick by two mainstays of his former germany squads , klose and lukas podolski , no matter how dreadful their league performances have been .
writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .

that has led many of germany 's footballing vips - everyone from bayern legend franz beckenbauer to coaches felix magath and ottmar hitzfeld - to call for a rethink on the kuranyi ban .
moreover , the striker himself has been delivering arguments - and not just in the form of goals - for a recall .
in an interview with the weekly germany news magazine der spiegel , kuranyi said he regretted his behavior back in 2008 .
" i made a mistake then but i have learned from it , " kuranyi told the magazine .
" everyone who knows me knows that i 'm a team player .
and everyone who knows me as a person knows i 'm a nice guy . "
the german press is widely interpreting the interview as the statement of regret needed from the player for loew to swallow his pride and give kuranyi another chance .

writing in der spiegel , sports journalist peter ahrens argued that a kuranyi nomination would be loew 's way of pretending to yield to public opinion while continuing to do things his way .
" the decision would be loew 's only way of silencing the disruptive salvos from the outside , " ahrens wrote .
" in south africa , loew would once again be the master of the situation .
he could play kuranyi , but he would n't have to . "
in other words , loew may decide the safest place for him to have kuranyi is at the far end of the reserves ' bench .
ahrens is n't the only one in germany who thinks that loew is prone to playing favorites .
torsten frings , the bremen defensive midfielder who was for many years a germany regular , used a post-match interview this weekend to attack his former national coach .
" everyone knows by now that performance does n't count in the national team , " frings told reporters after scoring two goals in bremen 's win over hoffenheim .
frings does n't have the sort of lobby to seriously trouble loew .
kuranyi does , and that makes him arguably the biggest threat to loew 's long-term job security .
if germany do well in south africa , no one will remember the accusations that loew put personalities before performance in kuranyi 's case .
but if germany go out early , there would be more weight behind arguments that loew 's stubbornness is detrimental to the team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 19.04.2010 merkel praises scale of innovation at hanover trade fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel was rather taken with this robot at the hanover fair despite the enormous volcanic ash cloud over europe preventing hundreds of exhibitors from making it to hanover , the world 's largest exhibition of industrial technology is expecting to have its best year ever . chancellor angela merkel was supposed to be joined by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi at the ceremony to kick off this year 's hanover fair .
however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .

however berlusconi could not travel to germany due to the large cloud of volcanic ash above the continent , which has caused 63,000 flights to be cancelled since thursday .
italy , a country with a long tradition of industrial engineering , is the partner country for this year 's fair , which runs through friday .
merkel impressed with innovative products merkel toured the fair instead with italy 's economics minister claudio scajola , who had come from italy by car .
merkel praised the level of innovation at the fair , which , she believes , will " lead the way , so we can come out of this crisis stronger than before . "
" last year we had a large backlog of orders from before the financial crisis , but it has to be said that , this year , the sheer scale of the hanover trade fair and the high level of innovation are a sign of hope that we can overcome this crisis , " she added .
industry is also upbeat this year 's motto , " efficiency - innovation - sustainability " , reflects the usual optimism that the hanover fair seeks to spread .
exhibitors seem to be showing remarkable self-confidence in light of the economic crisis of the past year .
" one businessman recently said to me , ' in the crisis , i 'll stick with the original - and the original is the hanover fair . '
and that 's why they come here , " the convention 's director wolfram von fritsch told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : electro-mobility is set to be a megatrend at this year 's convention market megatrends and come they have : despite the ash cloud causing an unprecedented number of flight cancellations over the past few days , bus convoys from istanbul and milan as well as convoys of cars from spain and scandinavia have made their way to hanover to attend the trade fair .
that so many have gone to such lengths to get there is an indication of how timely this year 's hanover fair has turned out to be .
much of the world is slowly coming out of the biggest economic recession in decades , and the world 's largest industrial showcase is a crucial indicator of that recovery .
four thousand and eight hundred exhibitors from 64 countries are displaying the newest in efficient and energy-saving products , as well as in the emerging field of " electro-mobility . "
friedhelm loh , head of the eletro-industry association , said he saw electro-mobility , energy efficiency and environmental protection as megatrends in the market - something that gives germany an advantage .
" we germans have a 16 percent stake in the world market , and i think the industry will further strengthen that , " he said .
greatest number of products ever in defiance of the market 's optimism , the volcanic ash cloud hanging over europe continues to disrupt air travel .
around 15 percent of the exhibitors , mainly from asia and the united states , are not expected to even make it to hanover .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fair has the largest number of innovations ever on display the hanover fair 's optimism is rooted in the 4,000 innovations that are to be put on display this year , " more than we 've ever had before , " said von fritsch .
the 4,800 exhibitors mirror the number that attended the convention in the boom year of 2008 .
in addition , more than 250 firms have booked exhibition space over the past four weeks alone .
" that 's something we 've never had before , " von fritsch said .
" and that confirms a trend over the past few months that we 've been able to read from several indicators . "

we 've been planning a vacation to italy for almost a year .
now it seems in jeopardy with this volcanic ash cloud .

but who knows for how long ?
we are to depart for rome this coming tuesday night , in 72 hours .
will we be able to ?
we are on pins and needles , and praying to auster , the roman god of the south wind .

my fiancé is german and his family and friends are flying in to florida for the wedding .
some friends and family were already planning to travel this week and we are literally on the edge of our seats waiting to see if the flight bans will be lifted in dusseldorf and cologne .
it would be such a shame if half of our guests could not make it !
we are praying that the air clears up soon ... very soon . - diana , us i am one of about 100 people stranded in bangkok on a flight from ho chi minh city to frankfurt and onward flights to destinations in europe and north africa .

we need to know what the vulnerability of each aircraft type really is , relative to various -lrb- low -rrb- levels of ash concentration .

piston engine aircraft , which have intake air filtration , possibly are no more vulnerable to low levels of contamination than cars and trucks are .
historically jets have routinely operated in low level sand and ash contamination conditions without problems other than potentially accelerated wear .
we know high levels of ash are a big no-no .
no question about that .
but we need to know what the real boundaries are relating to low levels .
so , more should be done to rigorously investigate the danger .
and it needs to be carried out urgently to avoid major job losses . - martin geliot , germany i work at sfo and see all major european airlines aircraft parked at the edge of the terminal and i see some people are kinda camping out in the food courts .
this will cause lasting problems for weeks after the ash cloud settles . - michael ray peterson , us people i know are having problems with their travel plans .
