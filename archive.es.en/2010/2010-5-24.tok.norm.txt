the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

" imagine a government which has delivered double-digit growth rates for over seven years losing an election anywhere on earth .
it is unheard of for such a phenomenon to happen , " meles told reuters news agency en route to the ethiopian capital addis ababa after casting his vote in the northern tigray region .
around 32 million people out of a population of 80 million were eligible to cast their vote to elect the 547-strong lower house of representatives in sub-saharan africa 's second most populous country .
final results are not expected for another month .
high voter turnout the european union 's chief observer said , while there were some allegations of irregularities that still needed to be evaluated , the parliamentary vote was largely " peaceful and calm " .
" in the vast majority of polling stations , the elections were well organized , " the eu 's chief observer thijs berman said .
" with this very high turnout and this peaceful and calm election , ethiopians have shown that they want full respect of their democratic rights , full respect of their electoral laws . "
the european union deployed some 160 observers and the african union sent 60 observers to monitor the polls .
the vote comes five years after the last election in which nearly 200 people were killed .
thousands of opposition supporters were then deported following a government crackdown .
prime minister meles zenawi 's ethiopian people 's revolutionary front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- is expected to repeat his election victory from 2005 .
the ruling party has been in power for the last 17 years after ousting the impoverished country 's communist regime in 1991 .
jailed regime opponent earlier this year human rights watch accused the zenawi government of " waging a coordinated and sustained attack on political opponents , journalists , and rights activists . "
" if you are not a member of the ruling party , you will get no food , seed of fertilizer , " said georgette gagnon , africa director of the new york-based human rights organization .
human rights watch has called for the release of opposition leader , birtukan mideksa , 36 , who is serving a life jail sentence .
she has been dubbed " the ethiopian aung san suu kyi " , in reference to burma 's detained pro-democracy activist .
ethiopia , which borders eritrea and somalia , remains a key us and western ally .
meles zenawi is seen as a guarantor for long-term political stability in the country and the region , according to diplomatic sources in addis ababa. nrt / afp / reuters editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.05.2010 merkel seeks to boost trade and promote peace on trip to gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to gain access to lucrative markets in the gulf german chancellor angela merkel began her tour of the gulf region in the united arab emirates on monday .
the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

but a large european network of engineers meeting in rome this week want to focus on what their profession can do to further reduce energy waste - in buildings , not in vehicles .
improving buildings ' energy efficiency is at the forefront of a new european union initiative called build up .
the public / private partnership aims to establish minimum standards for measuring energy efficiency , create a certification system for buildings that meet those standards , and help find ways to cut down on energy consumption .
the construction , maintenance , operation and demolition of houses and buildings account for some 40 percent of the eu 's total energy consumption and is a main source of greenhouse gases .
panos panagopoulos , president of the european federation of engineering consultancy associations -lrb- efca -rrb- , said this is the next " big story " for engineers .

gorjux said european engineers should start exporting this expertise to other areas of the world .

but a large european network of engineers meeting in rome this week want to focus on what their profession can do to further reduce energy waste - in buildings , not in vehicles .
improving buildings ' energy efficiency is at the forefront of a new european union initiative called build up .
the public / private partnership aims to establish minimum standards for measuring energy efficiency , create a certification system for buildings that meet those standards , and help find ways to cut down on energy consumption .
the construction , maintenance , operation and demolition of houses and buildings account for some 40 percent of the eu 's total energy consumption and is a main source of greenhouse gases .
panos panagopoulos , president of the european federation of engineering consultancy associations -lrb- efca -rrb- , said this is the next " big story " for engineers .
his organization is one of the co-sponsors of a rome conference about energy efficient buildings from may 26 to may 28 .
" buildings will be the focus of activity of engineers now for the next period , retrofitting buildings for reduced energy consumption , " panagopoulous said .

learning from the past vice president of the association of italian engineering organizations raffaele gorjux said making buildings more efficient is n't just about using new technology , either .
often , he said , the best ideas come from the past .
aspects of a building 's design - like having high or low ceilings or thick earthen walls - can passively make it more efficient .
" centuries ago , when air conditioning was not an option , still people managed to live comfortably , " said gorjux .
" sunscreens , ducts for air flow through buildings , use of day and night , a lot of techniques . "
gorjux said european engineers should start exporting this expertise to other areas of the world .
" for instance , in the middle east , some good skills exist in the area of new buildings , but there is no culture of rehabilitation of existing buildings , " gorjux said .

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

a controversial topless video has marred her wholesome image , but it has n't hurt sales of her singles . lena meyer-landrut is considered by many to represent germany 's first real chance in decades at winning eurovision , the continent 's cheesy and beloved singing battle . it is hoped that the 18-year-old 's naive charm and catchy song , called " satellite , " will finally capture the imagination and votes of eurovision watchers , and give germany a shot at the top prize on may 29 . it 's been a long dry spell for germany when it comes to eurovision .
while germany has participated in all but one of the campy singing extravaganzas since 1956 , it has only won once .
recent years have been disastrous .
germany was awarded 23rd out of 25 places in 2008 and in 2009 only saw a slight improvement , coming in at number 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her wholesome image has won her points meyer-landrut was meant to change all that , perhaps helped by a wholesome image that harkens back to nicole , the angelic-looking teenager who won for germany in 1982 .
but in the midst of meyer-landrut 's high school final exams this month , a video surfaced showing her frolicking topless in a swimming pool with a young man .
it has raised eyebrows and marred her teeny-bopper allure . " i just did the thing - i think it 's fine , " the teenager said in an interview with the dpa press agency about the scenes that were recorded last year for a tv show , but only recently made public . " it was n't pornography or anything , " she said , tapping into german tolerance when it comes to nudity on television . photos of the topless scenes have topped the tabloids and other media , although the singer appears unconcerned about possible damage to her image . " tell me why that should be a problem .
at home , my family always used to say : ' today 's newspaper is tomorrow 's fish wrap , " ' she told dpa . song success as another saying goes , " bad publicity is good publicity , " and sales of lena 's first album , " my cassette player " appear not to have been hurt by the video , which came out just days before the album 's release .
the title track refers to the quirky starlet 's penchant for kids ' stories on cassette tapes . but some commentators have said that , unlike children 's imaginations , the album lacks creativity and merely features imitations of everyone from bjoerk to kate nash , with less interesting lyrics . well-crafted or not , fans have been eating up several of its tracks .
her first three singles " satellite , " " bee " and " love me " charted in the top five during the first week of their release at the end of march .
eurovision entry " satellite " went to number one . bildunterschrift : lena was the youngest contestant on the german casting show , and aims to win in norway meyer-landrut is the only daughter of a single mother and a granddaughter of a diplomat .
she grabbed her ticket to this year 's eurovision , hosted by norway , at the german casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- . she 's long wanted a career in the spotlight , having started dancing lessons at age five , and forming a musical duo with a friend several years ago .
she 's getting that chance now , and on may 29 an estimated 125 million people will watch her perform .
" when i read about myself in the newspaper or see myself on tv , it still seems very unreal , " she told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it 's pretty hardcore when people come up to you on the street … but usually , i enjoy it .
i do n't mind giving autographs and letting them take pictures .
i think it 's really cute . "

a controversial topless video has marred her wholesome image , but it has n't hurt sales of her singles . lena meyer-landrut is considered by many to represent germany 's first real chance in decades at winning eurovision , the continent 's cheesy and beloved singing battle . it is hoped that the 18-year-old 's naive charm and catchy song , called " satellite , " will finally capture the imagination and votes of eurovision watchers , and give germany a shot at the top prize on may 29 . it 's been a long dry spell for germany when it comes to eurovision .
while germany has participated in all but one of the campy singing extravaganzas since 1956 , it has only won once .
recent years have been disastrous .

but in the midst of meyer-landrut 's high school final exams this month , a video surfaced showing her frolicking topless in a swimming pool with a young man .
it has raised eyebrows and marred her teeny-bopper allure . " i just did the thing - i think it 's fine , " the teenager said in an interview with the dpa press agency about the scenes that were recorded last year for a tv show , but only recently made public . " it was n't pornography or anything , " she said , tapping into german tolerance when it comes to nudity on television . photos of the topless scenes have topped the tabloids and other media , although the singer appears unconcerned about possible damage to her image . " tell me why that should be a problem .
at home , my family always used to say : ' today 's newspaper is tomorrow 's fish wrap , " ' she told dpa . song success as another saying goes , " bad publicity is good publicity , " and sales of lena 's first album , " my cassette player " appear not to have been hurt by the video , which came out just days before the album 's release .
the title track refers to the quirky starlet 's penchant for kids ' stories on cassette tapes . but some commentators have said that , unlike children 's imaginations , the album lacks creativity and merely features imitations of everyone from bjoerk to kate nash , with less interesting lyrics . well-crafted or not , fans have been eating up several of its tracks .
her first three singles " satellite , " " bee " and " love me " charted in the top five during the first week of their release at the end of march .

germany was awarded 23rd out of 25 places in 2008 and in 2009 only saw a slight improvement , coming in at number 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her wholesome image has won her points meyer-landrut was meant to change all that , perhaps helped by a wholesome image that harkens back to nicole , the angelic-looking teenager who won for germany in 1982 .
but in the midst of meyer-landrut 's high school final exams this month , a video surfaced showing her frolicking topless in a swimming pool with a young man .
it has raised eyebrows and marred her teeny-bopper allure . " i just did the thing - i think it 's fine , " the teenager said in an interview with the dpa press agency about the scenes that were recorded last year for a tv show , but only recently made public . " it was n't pornography or anything , " she said , tapping into german tolerance when it comes to nudity on television . photos of the topless scenes have topped the tabloids and other media , although the singer appears unconcerned about possible damage to her image . " tell me why that should be a problem .
at home , my family always used to say : ' today 's newspaper is tomorrow 's fish wrap , " ' she told dpa . song success as another saying goes , " bad publicity is good publicity , " and sales of lena 's first album , " my cassette player " appear not to have been hurt by the video , which came out just days before the album 's release .
the title track refers to the quirky starlet 's penchant for kids ' stories on cassette tapes . but some commentators have said that , unlike children 's imaginations , the album lacks creativity and merely features imitations of everyone from bjoerk to kate nash , with less interesting lyrics . well-crafted or not , fans have been eating up several of its tracks .
her first three singles " satellite , " " bee " and " love me " charted in the top five during the first week of their release at the end of march .
eurovision entry " satellite " went to number one . bildunterschrift : lena was the youngest contestant on the german casting show , and aims to win in norway meyer-landrut is the only daughter of a single mother and a granddaughter of a diplomat .
she grabbed her ticket to this year 's eurovision , hosted by norway , at the german casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- . she 's long wanted a career in the spotlight , having started dancing lessons at age five , and forming a musical duo with a friend several years ago .
she 's getting that chance now , and on may 29 an estimated 125 million people will watch her perform .
" when i read about myself in the newspaper or see myself on tv , it still seems very unreal , " she told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it 's pretty hardcore when people come up to you on the street … but usually , i enjoy it .
i do n't mind giving autographs and letting them take pictures .
i think it 's really cute . "

a controversial topless video has marred her wholesome image , but it has n't hurt sales of her singles . lena meyer-landrut is considered by many to represent germany 's first real chance in decades at winning eurovision , the continent 's cheesy and beloved singing battle . it is hoped that the 18-year-old 's naive charm and catchy song , called " satellite , " will finally capture the imagination and votes of eurovision watchers , and give germany a shot at the top prize on may 29 . it 's been a long dry spell for germany when it comes to eurovision .
while germany has participated in all but one of the campy singing extravaganzas since 1956 , it has only won once .
recent years have been disastrous .
germany was awarded 23rd out of 25 places in 2008 and in 2009 only saw a slight improvement , coming in at number 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her wholesome image has won her points meyer-landrut was meant to change all that , perhaps helped by a wholesome image that harkens back to nicole , the angelic-looking teenager who won for germany in 1982 .
but in the midst of meyer-landrut 's high school final exams this month , a video surfaced showing her frolicking topless in a swimming pool with a young man .
it has raised eyebrows and marred her teeny-bopper allure . " i just did the thing - i think it 's fine , " the teenager said in an interview with the dpa press agency about the scenes that were recorded last year for a tv show , but only recently made public . " it was n't pornography or anything , " she said , tapping into german tolerance when it comes to nudity on television . photos of the topless scenes have topped the tabloids and other media , although the singer appears unconcerned about possible damage to her image . " tell me why that should be a problem .
at home , my family always used to say : ' today 's newspaper is tomorrow 's fish wrap , " ' she told dpa . song success as another saying goes , " bad publicity is good publicity , " and sales of lena 's first album , " my cassette player " appear not to have been hurt by the video , which came out just days before the album 's release .
the title track refers to the quirky starlet 's penchant for kids ' stories on cassette tapes . but some commentators have said that , unlike children 's imaginations , the album lacks creativity and merely features imitations of everyone from bjoerk to kate nash , with less interesting lyrics . well-crafted or not , fans have been eating up several of its tracks .
her first three singles " satellite , " " bee " and " love me " charted in the top five during the first week of their release at the end of march .
eurovision entry " satellite " went to number one . bildunterschrift : lena was the youngest contestant on the german casting show , and aims to win in norway meyer-landrut is the only daughter of a single mother and a granddaughter of a diplomat .
she grabbed her ticket to this year 's eurovision , hosted by norway , at the german casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- . she 's long wanted a career in the spotlight , having started dancing lessons at age five , and forming a musical duo with a friend several years ago .
she 's getting that chance now , and on may 29 an estimated 125 million people will watch her perform .
" when i read about myself in the newspaper or see myself on tv , it still seems very unreal , " she told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it 's pretty hardcore when people come up to you on the street … but usually , i enjoy it .
i do n't mind giving autographs and letting them take pictures .
i think it 's really cute . "

a controversial topless video has marred her wholesome image , but it has n't hurt sales of her singles . lena meyer-landrut is considered by many to represent germany 's first real chance in decades at winning eurovision , the continent 's cheesy and beloved singing battle . it is hoped that the 18-year-old 's naive charm and catchy song , called " satellite , " will finally capture the imagination and votes of eurovision watchers , and give germany a shot at the top prize on may 29 . it 's been a long dry spell for germany when it comes to eurovision .
while germany has participated in all but one of the campy singing extravaganzas since 1956 , it has only won once .
recent years have been disastrous .
germany was awarded 23rd out of 25 places in 2008 and in 2009 only saw a slight improvement , coming in at number 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her wholesome image has won her points meyer-landrut was meant to change all that , perhaps helped by a wholesome image that harkens back to nicole , the angelic-looking teenager who won for germany in 1982 .
but in the midst of meyer-landrut 's high school final exams this month , a video surfaced showing her frolicking topless in a swimming pool with a young man .
it has raised eyebrows and marred her teeny-bopper allure . " i just did the thing - i think it 's fine , " the teenager said in an interview with the dpa press agency about the scenes that were recorded last year for a tv show , but only recently made public . " it was n't pornography or anything , " she said , tapping into german tolerance when it comes to nudity on television . photos of the topless scenes have topped the tabloids and other media , although the singer appears unconcerned about possible damage to her image . " tell me why that should be a problem .
at home , my family always used to say : ' today 's newspaper is tomorrow 's fish wrap , " ' she told dpa . song success as another saying goes , " bad publicity is good publicity , " and sales of lena 's first album , " my cassette player " appear not to have been hurt by the video , which came out just days before the album 's release .
the title track refers to the quirky starlet 's penchant for kids ' stories on cassette tapes . but some commentators have said that , unlike children 's imaginations , the album lacks creativity and merely features imitations of everyone from bjoerk to kate nash , with less interesting lyrics . well-crafted or not , fans have been eating up several of its tracks .
her first three singles " satellite , " " bee " and " love me " charted in the top five during the first week of their release at the end of march .
eurovision entry " satellite " went to number one . bildunterschrift : lena was the youngest contestant on the german casting show , and aims to win in norway meyer-landrut is the only daughter of a single mother and a granddaughter of a diplomat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.05.2010 british finance minister cuts billions from budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget cuts are planned to help rescue british finances , says george osborne the british finance minister george osborne has set out plans to cut billions of pounds from public spending , in a bid to restore the uk 's finances .
he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.05.2010 european engineers emphasize green value of low-energy buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and existing buildings need to be more efficient european union goals to cut energy consumption by 20 percent across the bloc has led to an emphasis on efficiency - not just in homes , but in office buildings , shopping malls , and other structures . the words " energy efficient " are usually applied to cars these days - the result of engineers coming up with more fuel-efficient models that take people further and pollute less .
but a large european network of engineers meeting in rome this week want to focus on what their profession can do to further reduce energy waste - in buildings , not in vehicles .
improving buildings ' energy efficiency is at the forefront of a new european union initiative called build up .
the public / private partnership aims to establish minimum standards for measuring energy efficiency , create a certification system for buildings that meet those standards , and help find ways to cut down on energy consumption .
the construction , maintenance , operation and demolition of houses and buildings account for some 40 percent of the eu 's total energy consumption and is a main source of greenhouse gases .
panos panagopoulos , president of the european federation of engineering consultancy associations -lrb- efca -rrb- , said this is the next " big story " for engineers .
his organization is one of the co-sponsors of a rome conference about energy efficient buildings from may 26 to may 28 .
" buildings will be the focus of activity of engineers now for the next period , retrofitting buildings for reduced energy consumption , " panagopoulous said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using new construction materials is n't the only way to save energy that can include things like redoing a roof with solar panels instead of ordinary tiles , placing solar film on windows so they reflect heat in cold climates , or better insulating buildings in cold climates .
learning from the past vice president of the association of italian engineering organizations raffaele gorjux said making buildings more efficient is n't just about using new technology , either .
often , he said , the best ideas come from the past .
aspects of a building 's design - like having high or low ceilings or thick earthen walls - can passively make it more efficient .
" centuries ago , when air conditioning was not an option , still people managed to live comfortably , " said gorjux .
" sunscreens , ducts for air flow through buildings , use of day and night , a lot of techniques . "
gorjux said european engineers should start exporting this expertise to other areas of the world .
" for instance , in the middle east , some good skills exist in the area of new buildings , but there is no culture of rehabilitation of existing buildings , " gorjux said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.05.2010 british finance minister cuts billions from budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget cuts are planned to help rescue british finances , says george osborne the british finance minister george osborne has set out plans to cut billions of pounds from public spending , in a bid to restore the uk 's finances .
he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.05.2010 european engineers emphasize green value of low-energy buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and existing buildings need to be more efficient european union goals to cut energy consumption by 20 percent across the bloc has led to an emphasis on efficiency - not just in homes , but in office buildings , shopping malls , and other structures . the words " energy efficient " are usually applied to cars these days - the result of engineers coming up with more fuel-efficient models that take people further and pollute less .
but a large european network of engineers meeting in rome this week want to focus on what their profession can do to further reduce energy waste - in buildings , not in vehicles .
improving buildings ' energy efficiency is at the forefront of a new european union initiative called build up .
the public / private partnership aims to establish minimum standards for measuring energy efficiency , create a certification system for buildings that meet those standards , and help find ways to cut down on energy consumption .
the construction , maintenance , operation and demolition of houses and buildings account for some 40 percent of the eu 's total energy consumption and is a main source of greenhouse gases .
panos panagopoulos , president of the european federation of engineering consultancy associations -lrb- efca -rrb- , said this is the next " big story " for engineers .
his organization is one of the co-sponsors of a rome conference about energy efficient buildings from may 26 to may 28 .
" buildings will be the focus of activity of engineers now for the next period , retrofitting buildings for reduced energy consumption , " panagopoulous said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using new construction materials is n't the only way to save energy that can include things like redoing a roof with solar panels instead of ordinary tiles , placing solar film on windows so they reflect heat in cold climates , or better insulating buildings in cold climates .
learning from the past vice president of the association of italian engineering organizations raffaele gorjux said making buildings more efficient is n't just about using new technology , either .
often , he said , the best ideas come from the past .
aspects of a building 's design - like having high or low ceilings or thick earthen walls - can passively make it more efficient .
" centuries ago , when air conditioning was not an option , still people managed to live comfortably , " said gorjux .
" sunscreens , ducts for air flow through buildings , use of day and night , a lot of techniques . "
gorjux said european engineers should start exporting this expertise to other areas of the world .
" for instance , in the middle east , some good skills exist in the area of new buildings , but there is no culture of rehabilitation of existing buildings , " gorjux said .

but a large european network of engineers meeting in rome this week want to focus on what their profession can do to further reduce energy waste - in buildings , not in vehicles .
improving buildings ' energy efficiency is at the forefront of a new european union initiative called build up .
the public / private partnership aims to establish minimum standards for measuring energy efficiency , create a certification system for buildings that meet those standards , and help find ways to cut down on energy consumption .
the construction , maintenance , operation and demolition of houses and buildings account for some 40 percent of the eu 's total energy consumption and is a main source of greenhouse gases .
panos panagopoulos , president of the european federation of engineering consultancy associations -lrb- efca -rrb- , said this is the next " big story " for engineers .
his organization is one of the co-sponsors of a rome conference about energy efficient buildings from may 26 to may 28 .
" buildings will be the focus of activity of engineers now for the next period , retrofitting buildings for reduced energy consumption , " panagopoulous said .

learning from the past vice president of the association of italian engineering organizations raffaele gorjux said making buildings more efficient is n't just about using new technology , either .

" centuries ago , when air conditioning was not an option , still people managed to live comfortably , " said gorjux .
" sunscreens , ducts for air flow through buildings , use of day and night , a lot of techniques . "
gorjux said european engineers should start exporting this expertise to other areas of the world .

" imagine a government which has delivered double-digit growth rates for over seven years losing an election anywhere on earth .
it is unheard of for such a phenomenon to happen , " meles told reuters news agency en route to the ethiopian capital addis ababa after casting his vote in the northern tigray region .
around 32 million people out of a population of 80 million were eligible to cast their vote to elect the 547-strong lower house of representatives in sub-saharan africa 's second most populous country .
final results are not expected for another month .
high voter turnout the european union 's chief observer said , while there were some allegations of irregularities that still needed to be evaluated , the parliamentary vote was largely " peaceful and calm " .
" in the vast majority of polling stations , the elections were well organized , " the eu 's chief observer thijs berman said .
" with this very high turnout and this peaceful and calm election , ethiopians have shown that they want full respect of their democratic rights , full respect of their electoral laws . "
the european union deployed some 160 observers and the african union sent 60 observers to monitor the polls .
the vote comes five years after the last election in which nearly 200 people were killed .
thousands of opposition supporters were then deported following a government crackdown .
prime minister meles zenawi 's ethiopian people 's revolutionary front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- is expected to repeat his election victory from 2005 .
the ruling party has been in power for the last 17 years after ousting the impoverished country 's communist regime in 1991 .
jailed regime opponent earlier this year human rights watch accused the zenawi government of " waging a coordinated and sustained attack on political opponents , journalists , and rights activists . "
" if you are not a member of the ruling party , you will get no food , seed of fertilizer , " said georgette gagnon , africa director of the new york-based human rights organization .
human rights watch has called for the release of opposition leader , birtukan mideksa , 36 , who is serving a life jail sentence .
she has been dubbed " the ethiopian aung san suu kyi " , in reference to burma 's detained pro-democracy activist .
ethiopia , which borders eritrea and somalia , remains a key us and western ally .
meles zenawi is seen as a guarantor for long-term political stability in the country and the region , according to diplomatic sources in addis ababa. nrt / afp / reuters editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.05.2010 british finance minister cuts billions from budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget cuts are planned to help rescue british finances , says george osborne the british finance minister george osborne has set out plans to cut billions of pounds from public spending , in a bid to restore the uk 's finances .
he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

" imagine a government which has delivered double-digit growth rates for over seven years losing an election anywhere on earth .
it is unheard of for such a phenomenon to happen , " meles told reuters news agency en route to the ethiopian capital addis ababa after casting his vote in the northern tigray region .
around 32 million people out of a population of 80 million were eligible to cast their vote to elect the 547-strong lower house of representatives in sub-saharan africa 's second most populous country .
final results are not expected for another month .
high voter turnout the european union 's chief observer said , while there were some allegations of irregularities that still needed to be evaluated , the parliamentary vote was largely " peaceful and calm " .
" in the vast majority of polling stations , the elections were well organized , " the eu 's chief observer thijs berman said .
" with this very high turnout and this peaceful and calm election , ethiopians have shown that they want full respect of their democratic rights , full respect of their electoral laws . "
the european union deployed some 160 observers and the african union sent 60 observers to monitor the polls .
the vote comes five years after the last election in which nearly 200 people were killed .
thousands of opposition supporters were then deported following a government crackdown .
prime minister meles zenawi 's ethiopian people 's revolutionary front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- is expected to repeat his election victory from 2005 .
the ruling party has been in power for the last 17 years after ousting the impoverished country 's communist regime in 1991 .
jailed regime opponent earlier this year human rights watch accused the zenawi government of " waging a coordinated and sustained attack on political opponents , journalists , and rights activists . "
" if you are not a member of the ruling party , you will get no food , seed of fertilizer , " said georgette gagnon , africa director of the new york-based human rights organization .
human rights watch has called for the release of opposition leader , birtukan mideksa , 36 , who is serving a life jail sentence .
she has been dubbed " the ethiopian aung san suu kyi " , in reference to burma 's detained pro-democracy activist .
ethiopia , which borders eritrea and somalia , remains a key us and western ally .
meles zenawi is seen as a guarantor for long-term political stability in the country and the region , according to diplomatic sources in addis ababa. nrt / afp / reuters editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.05.2010 british finance minister cuts billions from budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget cuts are planned to help rescue british finances , says george osborne the british finance minister george osborne has set out plans to cut billions of pounds from public spending , in a bid to restore the uk 's finances .
he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

" i just did the thing - i think it 's fine , " the teenager said in an interview with the dpa press agency about the scenes that were recorded last year for a tv show , but only recently made public . " it was n't pornography or anything , " she said , tapping into german tolerance when it comes to nudity on television . photos of the topless scenes have topped the tabloids and other media , although the singer appears unconcerned about possible damage to her image . " tell me why that should be a problem .
at home , my family always used to say : ' today 's newspaper is tomorrow 's fish wrap , " ' she told dpa . song success as another saying goes , " bad publicity is good publicity , " and sales of lena 's first album , " my cassette player " appear not to have been hurt by the video , which came out just days before the album 's release .
the title track refers to the quirky starlet 's penchant for kids ' stories on cassette tapes . but some commentators have said that , unlike children 's imaginations , the album lacks creativity and merely features imitations of everyone from bjoerk to kate nash , with less interesting lyrics . well-crafted or not , fans have been eating up several of its tracks .
her first three singles " satellite , " " bee " and " love me " charted in the top five during the first week of their release at the end of march .
eurovision entry " satellite " went to number one . bildunterschrift : lena was the youngest contestant on the german casting show , and aims to win in norway meyer-landrut is the only daughter of a single mother and a granddaughter of a diplomat .
she grabbed her ticket to this year 's eurovision , hosted by norway , at the german casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- . she 's long wanted a career in the spotlight , having started dancing lessons at age five , and forming a musical duo with a friend several years ago .
she 's getting that chance now , and on may 29 an estimated 125 million people will watch her perform .
" when i read about myself in the newspaper or see myself on tv , it still seems very unreal , " she told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it 's pretty hardcore when people come up to you on the street … but usually , i enjoy it .
i do n't mind giving autographs and letting them take pictures .
i think it 's really cute . "

a controversial topless video has marred her wholesome image , but it has n't hurt sales of her singles . lena meyer-landrut is considered by many to represent germany 's first real chance in decades at winning eurovision , the continent 's cheesy and beloved singing battle . it is hoped that the 18-year-old 's naive charm and catchy song , called " satellite , " will finally capture the imagination and votes of eurovision watchers , and give germany a shot at the top prize on may 29 . it 's been a long dry spell for germany when it comes to eurovision .
while germany has participated in all but one of the campy singing extravaganzas since 1956 , it has only won once .
recent years have been disastrous .
germany was awarded 23rd out of 25 places in 2008 and in 2009 only saw a slight improvement , coming in at number 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her wholesome image has won her points meyer-landrut was meant to change all that , perhaps helped by a wholesome image that harkens back to nicole , the angelic-looking teenager who won for germany in 1982 .
but in the midst of meyer-landrut 's high school final exams this month , a video surfaced showing her frolicking topless in a swimming pool with a young man .
it has raised eyebrows and marred her teeny-bopper allure . " i just did the thing - i think it 's fine , " the teenager said in an interview with the dpa press agency about the scenes that were recorded last year for a tv show , but only recently made public . " it was n't pornography or anything , " she said , tapping into german tolerance when it comes to nudity on television . photos of the topless scenes have topped the tabloids and other media , although the singer appears unconcerned about possible damage to her image . " tell me why that should be a problem .
at home , my family always used to say : ' today 's newspaper is tomorrow 's fish wrap , " ' she told dpa . song success as another saying goes , " bad publicity is good publicity , " and sales of lena 's first album , " my cassette player " appear not to have been hurt by the video , which came out just days before the album 's release .
the title track refers to the quirky starlet 's penchant for kids ' stories on cassette tapes . but some commentators have said that , unlike children 's imaginations , the album lacks creativity and merely features imitations of everyone from bjoerk to kate nash , with less interesting lyrics . well-crafted or not , fans have been eating up several of its tracks .
her first three singles " satellite , " " bee " and " love me " charted in the top five during the first week of their release at the end of march .
eurovision entry " satellite " went to number one . bildunterschrift : lena was the youngest contestant on the german casting show , and aims to win in norway meyer-landrut is the only daughter of a single mother and a granddaughter of a diplomat .
she grabbed her ticket to this year 's eurovision , hosted by norway , at the german casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- . she 's long wanted a career in the spotlight , having started dancing lessons at age five , and forming a musical duo with a friend several years ago .
she 's getting that chance now , and on may 29 an estimated 125 million people will watch her perform .
" when i read about myself in the newspaper or see myself on tv , it still seems very unreal , " she told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it 's pretty hardcore when people come up to you on the street … but usually , i enjoy it .
i do n't mind giving autographs and letting them take pictures .
i think it 's really cute . "

a controversial topless video has marred her wholesome image , but it has n't hurt sales of her singles . lena meyer-landrut is considered by many to represent germany 's first real chance in decades at winning eurovision , the continent 's cheesy and beloved singing battle . it is hoped that the 18-year-old 's naive charm and catchy song , called " satellite , " will finally capture the imagination and votes of eurovision watchers , and give germany a shot at the top prize on may 29 . it 's been a long dry spell for germany when it comes to eurovision .
while germany has participated in all but one of the campy singing extravaganzas since 1956 , it has only won once .
recent years have been disastrous .
germany was awarded 23rd out of 25 places in 2008 and in 2009 only saw a slight improvement , coming in at number 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her wholesome image has won her points meyer-landrut was meant to change all that , perhaps helped by a wholesome image that harkens back to nicole , the angelic-looking teenager who won for germany in 1982 .
but in the midst of meyer-landrut 's high school final exams this month , a video surfaced showing her frolicking topless in a swimming pool with a young man .
it has raised eyebrows and marred her teeny-bopper allure . " i just did the thing - i think it 's fine , " the teenager said in an interview with the dpa press agency about the scenes that were recorded last year for a tv show , but only recently made public . " it was n't pornography or anything , " she said , tapping into german tolerance when it comes to nudity on television . photos of the topless scenes have topped the tabloids and other media , although the singer appears unconcerned about possible damage to her image . " tell me why that should be a problem .
at home , my family always used to say : ' today 's newspaper is tomorrow 's fish wrap , " ' she told dpa . song success as another saying goes , " bad publicity is good publicity , " and sales of lena 's first album , " my cassette player " appear not to have been hurt by the video , which came out just days before the album 's release .
the title track refers to the quirky starlet 's penchant for kids ' stories on cassette tapes . but some commentators have said that , unlike children 's imaginations , the album lacks creativity and merely features imitations of everyone from bjoerk to kate nash , with less interesting lyrics . well-crafted or not , fans have been eating up several of its tracks .
her first three singles " satellite , " " bee " and " love me " charted in the top five during the first week of their release at the end of march .
eurovision entry " satellite " went to number one . bildunterschrift : lena was the youngest contestant on the german casting show , and aims to win in norway meyer-landrut is the only daughter of a single mother and a granddaughter of a diplomat .

germany was awarded 23rd out of 25 places in 2008 and in 2009 only saw a slight improvement , coming in at number 20 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her wholesome image has won her points meyer-landrut was meant to change all that , perhaps helped by a wholesome image that harkens back to nicole , the angelic-looking teenager who won for germany in 1982 .
but in the midst of meyer-landrut 's high school final exams this month , a video surfaced showing her frolicking topless in a swimming pool with a young man .
it has raised eyebrows and marred her teeny-bopper allure . " i just did the thing - i think it 's fine , " the teenager said in an interview with the dpa press agency about the scenes that were recorded last year for a tv show , but only recently made public . " it was n't pornography or anything , " she said , tapping into german tolerance when it comes to nudity on television . photos of the topless scenes have topped the tabloids and other media , although the singer appears unconcerned about possible damage to her image . " tell me why that should be a problem .
at home , my family always used to say : ' today 's newspaper is tomorrow 's fish wrap , " ' she told dpa . song success as another saying goes , " bad publicity is good publicity , " and sales of lena 's first album , " my cassette player " appear not to have been hurt by the video , which came out just days before the album 's release .
the title track refers to the quirky starlet 's penchant for kids ' stories on cassette tapes . but some commentators have said that , unlike children 's imaginations , the album lacks creativity and merely features imitations of everyone from bjoerk to kate nash , with less interesting lyrics . well-crafted or not , fans have been eating up several of its tracks .
her first three singles " satellite , " " bee " and " love me " charted in the top five during the first week of their release at the end of march .
eurovision entry " satellite " went to number one . bildunterschrift : lena was the youngest contestant on the german casting show , and aims to win in norway meyer-landrut is the only daughter of a single mother and a granddaughter of a diplomat .
she grabbed her ticket to this year 's eurovision , hosted by norway , at the german casting show " unser star fuer oslo " -lrb- " our star for oslo " -rrb- . she 's long wanted a career in the spotlight , having started dancing lessons at age five , and forming a musical duo with a friend several years ago .
she 's getting that chance now , and on may 29 an estimated 125 million people will watch her perform .
" when i read about myself in the newspaper or see myself on tv , it still seems very unreal , " she told deutsche welle in an interview .
" it 's pretty hardcore when people come up to you on the street … but usually , i enjoy it .
i do n't mind giving autographs and letting them take pictures .
i think it 's really cute . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.05.2010 merkel seeks to boost trade and promote peace on trip to gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to gain access to lucrative markets in the gulf german chancellor angela merkel began her tour of the gulf region in the united arab emirates on monday .
the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 24.05.2010 european engineers emphasize green value of low-energy buildings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and existing buildings need to be more efficient european union goals to cut energy consumption by 20 percent across the bloc has led to an emphasis on efficiency - not just in homes , but in office buildings , shopping malls , and other structures . the words " energy efficient " are usually applied to cars these days - the result of engineers coming up with more fuel-efficient models that take people further and pollute less .
but a large european network of engineers meeting in rome this week want to focus on what their profession can do to further reduce energy waste - in buildings , not in vehicles .
improving buildings ' energy efficiency is at the forefront of a new european union initiative called build up .
the public / private partnership aims to establish minimum standards for measuring energy efficiency , create a certification system for buildings that meet those standards , and help find ways to cut down on energy consumption .
the construction , maintenance , operation and demolition of houses and buildings account for some 40 percent of the eu 's total energy consumption and is a main source of greenhouse gases .
panos panagopoulos , president of the european federation of engineering consultancy associations -lrb- efca -rrb- , said this is the next " big story " for engineers .
his organization is one of the co-sponsors of a rome conference about energy efficient buildings from may 26 to may 28 .
" buildings will be the focus of activity of engineers now for the next period , retrofitting buildings for reduced energy consumption , " panagopoulous said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using new construction materials is n't the only way to save energy that can include things like redoing a roof with solar panels instead of ordinary tiles , placing solar film on windows so they reflect heat in cold climates , or better insulating buildings in cold climates .
learning from the past vice president of the association of italian engineering organizations raffaele gorjux said making buildings more efficient is n't just about using new technology , either .
often , he said , the best ideas come from the past .
aspects of a building 's design - like having high or low ceilings or thick earthen walls - can passively make it more efficient .
" centuries ago , when air conditioning was not an option , still people managed to live comfortably , " said gorjux .

" imagine a government which has delivered double-digit growth rates for over seven years losing an election anywhere on earth .
it is unheard of for such a phenomenon to happen , " meles told reuters news agency en route to the ethiopian capital addis ababa after casting his vote in the northern tigray region .
around 32 million people out of a population of 80 million were eligible to cast their vote to elect the 547-strong lower house of representatives in sub-saharan africa 's second most populous country .
final results are not expected for another month .
high voter turnout the european union 's chief observer said , while there were some allegations of irregularities that still needed to be evaluated , the parliamentary vote was largely " peaceful and calm " .
" in the vast majority of polling stations , the elections were well organized , " the eu 's chief observer thijs berman said .
" with this very high turnout and this peaceful and calm election , ethiopians have shown that they want full respect of their democratic rights , full respect of their electoral laws . "
the european union deployed some 160 observers and the african union sent 60 observers to monitor the polls .
the vote comes five years after the last election in which nearly 200 people were killed .
thousands of opposition supporters were then deported following a government crackdown .
prime minister meles zenawi 's ethiopian people 's revolutionary front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- is expected to repeat his election victory from 2005 .
the ruling party has been in power for the last 17 years after ousting the impoverished country 's communist regime in 1991 .
jailed regime opponent earlier this year human rights watch accused the zenawi government of " waging a coordinated and sustained attack on political opponents , journalists , and rights activists . "
" if you are not a member of the ruling party , you will get no food , seed of fertilizer , " said georgette gagnon , africa director of the new york-based human rights organization .
human rights watch has called for the release of opposition leader , birtukan mideksa , 36 , who is serving a life jail sentence .
she has been dubbed " the ethiopian aung san suu kyi " , in reference to burma 's detained pro-democracy activist .
ethiopia , which borders eritrea and somalia , remains a key us and western ally .
meles zenawi is seen as a guarantor for long-term political stability in the country and the region , according to diplomatic sources in addis ababa. nrt / afp / reuters editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .

some polls have found that prime minister manmohan singh has high approval ratings and would likely be re-elected if an election took place tomorrow , while others say there is a feeling that the government has not done enough to address critical issues such as rising prices and corruption . singh said on monday he would act to curb this latter phenomenon : " i would like to say that our government has been very clear from the beginning that corruption is a problem and if i come to know that there is any involvement at any level in corruption , we will take action . " there is a growing controversy over charges that precious airwaves for 2g were sold to telecom firms at throwaway prices , resulting in losses worth billions of dollars .
questions have been raised with regard to 15 billion dollars the government is to get from a recent 3g spectrum auction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian pm and members of the media observe a minute 's silence to pay tribute to the victims of the mangalore air crash both the bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- and the communist party of india-marxist -lrb- cpi-m -rrb- have called for telecom minister a. raja 's resignation , saying the auction was a major scam . " trust deficit has to be tackled " addressing journalists on a number of issues , ranging from maoist violence to price rises , 77-year-old singh , who is the second prime minister only after nehru to have a second innings , said the first year had been one of " reasonable achievement " and that he would now transfer his energies to transforming relations with pakistan . " it is my conviction that a major problem between our two countries , why we have n't been able to make headway in the composite dialogue , is that there has been a lack of adequate trust .
the trust deficit is the biggest problem and unless we tackle it , we can not move to substantive negotiations , " he said . the upa came back to power a year ago on a numerically stronger footing in the lok sabha but far short of a majority .
flush with the success of the rural employment guarantee scheme and the path-breaking right to information -lrb- rti -rrb- act in its first stint , the upa promised to bring in ambitious legislation . " happy to make place for anybody " however , in its second stint , the government 's energies have so far focused on inflation , particularly regarding food and essential items and increased maoist violence in the country .
the women 's reservation bill that promises to provide 33 percent of all seats in parliament and state assemblies to women and the food security bill have yet to become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some indians think congress general secretary rahul gandhi would make a better pm than singh a key question in many recent opinion polls has been whether general secretary rahul gandhi would make a better prime minister .
singh on monday said he was not going anywhere yet and had an agenda to complete , however he did say he would make way in future . " let me say that i sometimes feel that younger people should take over .
as and when i think the congress party makes that judgment , i would be happy to make place for anybody . " despite the mounting controversies involving ministers in his cabinet and rising food prices , singh left it to the historians to judge his legacy , saying he was more concerned about the task at hand .

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

but a large european network of engineers meeting in rome this week want to focus on what their profession can do to further reduce energy waste - in buildings , not in vehicles .
improving buildings ' energy efficiency is at the forefront of a new european union initiative called build up .
the public / private partnership aims to establish minimum standards for measuring energy efficiency , create a certification system for buildings that meet those standards , and help find ways to cut down on energy consumption .
the construction , maintenance , operation and demolition of houses and buildings account for some 40 percent of the eu 's total energy consumption and is a main source of greenhouse gases .
panos panagopoulos , president of the european federation of engineering consultancy associations -lrb- efca -rrb- , said this is the next " big story " for engineers .
his organization is one of the co-sponsors of a rome conference about energy efficient buildings from may 26 to may 28 .
" buildings will be the focus of activity of engineers now for the next period , retrofitting buildings for reduced energy consumption , " panagopoulous said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using new construction materials is n't the only way to save energy that can include things like redoing a roof with solar panels instead of ordinary tiles , placing solar film on windows so they reflect heat in cold climates , or better insulating buildings in cold climates .
learning from the past vice president of the association of italian engineering organizations raffaele gorjux said making buildings more efficient is n't just about using new technology , either .
often , he said , the best ideas come from the past .
aspects of a building 's design - like having high or low ceilings or thick earthen walls - can passively make it more efficient .
" centuries ago , when air conditioning was not an option , still people managed to live comfortably , " said gorjux .
" sunscreens , ducts for air flow through buildings , use of day and night , a lot of techniques . "
gorjux said european engineers should start exporting this expertise to other areas of the world .
" for instance , in the middle east , some good skills exist in the area of new buildings , but there is no culture of rehabilitation of existing buildings , " gorjux said .

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .

she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

improving buildings ' energy efficiency is at the forefront of a new european union initiative called build up .

panos panagopoulos , president of the european federation of engineering consultancy associations -lrb- efca -rrb- , said this is the next " big story " for engineers .

some polls have found that prime minister manmohan singh has high approval ratings and would likely be re-elected if an election took place tomorrow , while others say there is a feeling that the government has not done enough to address critical issues such as rising prices and corruption . singh said on monday he would act to curb this latter phenomenon : " i would like to say that our government has been very clear from the beginning that corruption is a problem and if i come to know that there is any involvement at any level in corruption , we will take action . " there is a growing controversy over charges that precious airwaves for 2g were sold to telecom firms at throwaway prices , resulting in losses worth billions of dollars .
questions have been raised with regard to 15 billion dollars the government is to get from a recent 3g spectrum auction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian pm and members of the media observe a minute 's silence to pay tribute to the victims of the mangalore air crash both the bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- and the communist party of india-marxist -lrb- cpi-m -rrb- have called for telecom minister a. raja 's resignation , saying the auction was a major scam . " trust deficit has to be tackled " addressing journalists on a number of issues , ranging from maoist violence to price rises , 77-year-old singh , who is the second prime minister only after nehru to have a second innings , said the first year had been one of " reasonable achievement " and that he would now transfer his energies to transforming relations with pakistan . " it is my conviction that a major problem between our two countries , why we have n't been able to make headway in the composite dialogue , is that there has been a lack of adequate trust .
the trust deficit is the biggest problem and unless we tackle it , we can not move to substantive negotiations , " he said . the upa came back to power a year ago on a numerically stronger footing in the lok sabha but far short of a majority .
flush with the success of the rural employment guarantee scheme and the path-breaking right to information -lrb- rti -rrb- act in its first stint , the upa promised to bring in ambitious legislation . " happy to make place for anybody " however , in its second stint , the government 's energies have so far focused on inflation , particularly regarding food and essential items and increased maoist violence in the country .
the women 's reservation bill that promises to provide 33 percent of all seats in parliament and state assemblies to women and the food security bill have yet to become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some indians think congress general secretary rahul gandhi would make a better pm than singh a key question in many recent opinion polls has been whether general secretary rahul gandhi would make a better prime minister .
singh on monday said he was not going anywhere yet and had an agenda to complete , however he did say he would make way in future . " let me say that i sometimes feel that younger people should take over .
as and when i think the congress party makes that judgment , i would be happy to make place for anybody . " despite the mounting controversies involving ministers in his cabinet and rising food prices , singh left it to the historians to judge his legacy , saying he was more concerned about the task at hand .

he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

but a large european network of engineers meeting in rome this week want to focus on what their profession can do to further reduce energy waste - in buildings , not in vehicles .
improving buildings ' energy efficiency is at the forefront of a new european union initiative called build up .
the public / private partnership aims to establish minimum standards for measuring energy efficiency , create a certification system for buildings that meet those standards , and help find ways to cut down on energy consumption .
the construction , maintenance , operation and demolition of houses and buildings account for some 40 percent of the eu 's total energy consumption and is a main source of greenhouse gases .
panos panagopoulos , president of the european federation of engineering consultancy associations -lrb- efca -rrb- , said this is the next " big story " for engineers .
his organization is one of the co-sponsors of a rome conference about energy efficient buildings from may 26 to may 28 .
" buildings will be the focus of activity of engineers now for the next period , retrofitting buildings for reduced energy consumption , " panagopoulous said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using new construction materials is n't the only way to save energy that can include things like redoing a roof with solar panels instead of ordinary tiles , placing solar film on windows so they reflect heat in cold climates , or better insulating buildings in cold climates .
learning from the past vice president of the association of italian engineering organizations raffaele gorjux said making buildings more efficient is n't just about using new technology , either .
often , he said , the best ideas come from the past .
aspects of a building 's design - like having high or low ceilings or thick earthen walls - can passively make it more efficient .
" centuries ago , when air conditioning was not an option , still people managed to live comfortably , " said gorjux .
" sunscreens , ducts for air flow through buildings , use of day and night , a lot of techniques . "
gorjux said european engineers should start exporting this expertise to other areas of the world .
" for instance , in the middle east , some good skills exist in the area of new buildings , but there is no culture of rehabilitation of existing buildings , " gorjux said .

some polls have found that prime minister manmohan singh has high approval ratings and would likely be re-elected if an election took place tomorrow , while others say there is a feeling that the government has not done enough to address critical issues such as rising prices and corruption . singh said on monday he would act to curb this latter phenomenon : " i would like to say that our government has been very clear from the beginning that corruption is a problem and if i come to know that there is any involvement at any level in corruption , we will take action . " there is a growing controversy over charges that precious airwaves for 2g were sold to telecom firms at throwaway prices , resulting in losses worth billions of dollars .
questions have been raised with regard to 15 billion dollars the government is to get from a recent 3g spectrum auction . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the indian pm and members of the media observe a minute 's silence to pay tribute to the victims of the mangalore air crash both the bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- and the communist party of india-marxist -lrb- cpi-m -rrb- have called for telecom minister a. raja 's resignation , saying the auction was a major scam . " trust deficit has to be tackled " addressing journalists on a number of issues , ranging from maoist violence to price rises , 77-year-old singh , who is the second prime minister only after nehru to have a second innings , said the first year had been one of " reasonable achievement " and that he would now transfer his energies to transforming relations with pakistan . " it is my conviction that a major problem between our two countries , why we have n't been able to make headway in the composite dialogue , is that there has been a lack of adequate trust .
the trust deficit is the biggest problem and unless we tackle it , we can not move to substantive negotiations , " he said . the upa came back to power a year ago on a numerically stronger footing in the lok sabha but far short of a majority .
flush with the success of the rural employment guarantee scheme and the path-breaking right to information -lrb- rti -rrb- act in its first stint , the upa promised to bring in ambitious legislation . " happy to make place for anybody " however , in its second stint , the government 's energies have so far focused on inflation , particularly regarding food and essential items and increased maoist violence in the country .
the women 's reservation bill that promises to provide 33 percent of all seats in parliament and state assemblies to women and the food security bill have yet to become law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some indians think congress general secretary rahul gandhi would make a better pm than singh a key question in many recent opinion polls has been whether general secretary rahul gandhi would make a better prime minister .
singh on monday said he was not going anywhere yet and had an agenda to complete , however he did say he would make way in future . " let me say that i sometimes feel that younger people should take over .
as and when i think the congress party makes that judgment , i would be happy to make place for anybody . " despite the mounting controversies involving ministers in his cabinet and rising food prices , singh left it to the historians to judge his legacy , saying he was more concerned about the task at hand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.05.2010 merkel seeks to boost trade and promote peace on trip to gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to gain access to lucrative markets in the gulf german chancellor angela merkel began her tour of the gulf region in the united arab emirates on monday .
the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.05.2010 merkel seeks to boost trade and promote peace on trip to gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to gain access to lucrative markets in the gulf german chancellor angela merkel began her tour of the gulf region in the united arab emirates on monday .
the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

" imagine a government which has delivered double-digit growth rates for over seven years losing an election anywhere on earth .
it is unheard of for such a phenomenon to happen , " meles told reuters news agency en route to the ethiopian capital addis ababa after casting his vote in the northern tigray region .
around 32 million people out of a population of 80 million were eligible to cast their vote to elect the 547-strong lower house of representatives in sub-saharan africa 's second most populous country .
final results are not expected for another month .
high voter turnout the european union 's chief observer said , while there were some allegations of irregularities that still needed to be evaluated , the parliamentary vote was largely " peaceful and calm " .
" in the vast majority of polling stations , the elections were well organized , " the eu 's chief observer thijs berman said .
" with this very high turnout and this peaceful and calm election , ethiopians have shown that they want full respect of their democratic rights , full respect of their electoral laws . "
the european union deployed some 160 observers and the african union sent 60 observers to monitor the polls .

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .

german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .

she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .

german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .

mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .

" imagine a government which has delivered double-digit growth rates for over seven years losing an election anywhere on earth .
it is unheard of for such a phenomenon to happen , " meles told reuters news agency en route to the ethiopian capital addis ababa after casting his vote in the northern tigray region .
around 32 million people out of a population of 80 million were eligible to cast their vote to elect the 547-strong lower house of representatives in sub-saharan africa 's second most populous country .
final results are not expected for another month .
high voter turnout the european union 's chief observer said , while there were some allegations of irregularities that still needed to be evaluated , the parliamentary vote was largely " peaceful and calm " .
" in the vast majority of polling stations , the elections were well organized , " the eu 's chief observer thijs berman said .
" with this very high turnout and this peaceful and calm election , ethiopians have shown that they want full respect of their democratic rights , full respect of their electoral laws . "
the european union deployed some 160 observers and the african union sent 60 observers to monitor the polls .
the vote comes five years after the last election in which nearly 200 people were killed .
thousands of opposition supporters were then deported following a government crackdown .
prime minister meles zenawi 's ethiopian people 's revolutionary front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- is expected to repeat his election victory from 2005 .
the ruling party has been in power for the last 17 years after ousting the impoverished country 's communist regime in 1991 .
jailed regime opponent earlier this year human rights watch accused the zenawi government of " waging a coordinated and sustained attack on political opponents , journalists , and rights activists . "
" if you are not a member of the ruling party , you will get no food , seed of fertilizer , " said georgette gagnon , africa director of the new york-based human rights organization .
human rights watch has called for the release of opposition leader , birtukan mideksa , 36 , who is serving a life jail sentence .
she has been dubbed " the ethiopian aung san suu kyi " , in reference to burma 's detained pro-democracy activist .
ethiopia , which borders eritrea and somalia , remains a key us and western ally .
meles zenawi is seen as a guarantor for long-term political stability in the country and the region , according to diplomatic sources in addis ababa. nrt / afp / reuters editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 24.05.2010 merkel seeks to boost trade and promote peace on trip to gulf großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to gain access to lucrative markets in the gulf german chancellor angela merkel began her tour of the gulf region in the united arab emirates on monday .
the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.05.2010 british finance minister cuts billions from budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the budget cuts are planned to help rescue british finances , says george osborne the british finance minister george osborne has set out plans to cut billions of pounds from public spending , in a bid to restore the uk 's finances .
he warned there would be further cuts to come . less than a fortnight after the conservative-liberal democrat coalition took power in britain , chancellor of the exchequer -lrb- finance minister -rrb- george osborne has outlined plans to cut 6.2 billion pounds -lrb- 7.22 billion euros , $ 8.92 billion -rrb- from government spending to help reduce the budget deficit .
" in the space of just one week , we have found and agreed to cut six and a quarter billion pounds of wasteful spending across the public sector , " osborne said .
the government intends to eliminate the bulk of the uk 's budget deficit , currently estimated at 156 billion pounds , over the next five years .
where the axe falls there will be a civil service recruitment freeze , cuts to it programmes , property and travel budgets .
government departments will have to trim hundreds of millions of pounds from their current outgoings .
the biggest cuts are due to be made at the departments for business , local government , transport and the devolved administrations which run scotland , wales and northern ireland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the coalition has pledged to protect frontline services the british finance minister hinted that , in his opinion , the uk could find itself looking at a debt crisis along the lines of greece , if it did not act fast .
" around europe , people are waking up to the challenge of those very large deficits .
if we did n't take action now , i think we would be putting the stability of the british economy in grave danger , " osborne said .
the coalition government has pledged to safeguard certain frontline services such as the national health service and schools .
defense and international aid spending were also spared the cuts .
more cuts to come the coalition said this was the first round of difficult cuts on spending , and " will not be the last " .
chief secretary to the treasury , liberal democrat david laws , admitted these cuts were " the easiest efficiency savings and the most obvious areas of waste . "
" as we go further into this process , the more difficult decisions will have to be made , and we 're all conscious of that , " laws said .
the coalition did not say how many public sector jobs might go , but they did say the bulk would come from not filling unoccupied posts rather than redundancies .
however , there is still a very real possibility of strike action by unions .
market confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial market is closely watching the new coalition 's budget david jones , chief market strategist at ig markets , said the financial sector has been looking for reassurance and the cuts were " a step in the right direction " .
however he said there were still fears of contagion from the eurozone .
" we should n't think the uk is immune , because we are carrying a significant chunk of debt .
the cuts are only six billion pounds , and still leaves us with a lot more to pay off over the next few years , " jones told deutsche welle .
the economy and the issue of cutting the budget deficit was a key issue in the election campaign , lost by former prime minister gordon brown 's labour party .
now in opposition , labour continue to warn that cutting public spending this soon represents a serious risk to the uk 's economic recovery .
" i think it could hit the chances of a strong recovery and put us in the slow lane for growth out of the recession , " said former chief secretary to the treasury , liam byrne .
the coalition is aware it also needs to take its own share in the cuts being handed out .
public servants will now be banned from travelling first class , and government ministers will no longer have a dedicated car and driver , in order to encourage use of public transport .

often , he said , the best ideas come from the past .
aspects of a building 's design - like having high or low ceilings or thick earthen walls - can passively make it more efficient .
" centuries ago , when air conditioning was not an option , still people managed to live comfortably , " said gorjux .
" sunscreens , ducts for air flow through buildings , use of day and night , a lot of techniques . "
gorjux said european engineers should start exporting this expertise to other areas of the world .

but a large european network of engineers meeting in rome this week want to focus on what their profession can do to further reduce energy waste - in buildings , not in vehicles .
improving buildings ' energy efficiency is at the forefront of a new european union initiative called build up .
the public / private partnership aims to establish minimum standards for measuring energy efficiency , create a certification system for buildings that meet those standards , and help find ways to cut down on energy consumption .
the construction , maintenance , operation and demolition of houses and buildings account for some 40 percent of the eu 's total energy consumption and is a main source of greenhouse gases .
panos panagopoulos , president of the european federation of engineering consultancy associations -lrb- efca -rrb- , said this is the next " big story " for engineers .
his organization is one of the co-sponsors of a rome conference about energy efficient buildings from may 26 to may 28 .
" buildings will be the focus of activity of engineers now for the next period , retrofitting buildings for reduced energy consumption , " panagopoulous said .

" imagine a government which has delivered double-digit growth rates for over seven years losing an election anywhere on earth .
it is unheard of for such a phenomenon to happen , " meles told reuters news agency en route to the ethiopian capital addis ababa after casting his vote in the northern tigray region .
around 32 million people out of a population of 80 million were eligible to cast their vote to elect the 547-strong lower house of representatives in sub-saharan africa 's second most populous country .
final results are not expected for another month .
high voter turnout the european union 's chief observer said , while there were some allegations of irregularities that still needed to be evaluated , the parliamentary vote was largely " peaceful and calm " .
" in the vast majority of polling stations , the elections were well organized , " the eu 's chief observer thijs berman said .
" with this very high turnout and this peaceful and calm election , ethiopians have shown that they want full respect of their democratic rights , full respect of their electoral laws . "
the european union deployed some 160 observers and the african union sent 60 observers to monitor the polls .
the vote comes five years after the last election in which nearly 200 people were killed .
thousands of opposition supporters were then deported following a government crackdown .
prime minister meles zenawi 's ethiopian people 's revolutionary front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- is expected to repeat his election victory from 2005 .
the ruling party has been in power for the last 17 years after ousting the impoverished country 's communist regime in 1991 .
jailed regime opponent earlier this year human rights watch accused the zenawi government of " waging a coordinated and sustained attack on political opponents , journalists , and rights activists . "
" if you are not a member of the ruling party , you will get no food , seed of fertilizer , " said georgette gagnon , africa director of the new york-based human rights organization .
human rights watch has called for the release of opposition leader , birtukan mideksa , 36 , who is serving a life jail sentence .
she has been dubbed " the ethiopian aung san suu kyi " , in reference to burma 's detained pro-democracy activist .
ethiopia , which borders eritrea and somalia , remains a key us and western ally .
meles zenawi is seen as a guarantor for long-term political stability in the country and the region , according to diplomatic sources in addis ababa. nrt / afp / reuters editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the four-day trip will also include political talks in bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia . german chancellor angela merkel on monday began a four-day tour of the gulf region to promote the middle east peace process .
political talks in the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- , bahrain , qatar and saudi arabia will also be dominated by regional security issues and the nuclear standoff with iran .
the ongoing financial crisis , the weakness of the euro and ensuring the security of europe 's oil supply will also be high on the agenda .
however , critics have been wondering why the german chancellor should embark on tour of gulf states while the euro is in the middle of its worst crisis ever . " because they also have an interest in a strong europe , the gulf states have proved very helpful in the economic crisis with investments .
one example is qatar 's cooperation with vw and porsche , " merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been criticized for turning her back on europe 's problems .
german business elite accompanied by a delegation of german business leaders , merkel sealed contracts for plastic production and a natural gas service during her first stopover in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
the uae is one of the most important economic partners for germany in the middle east . the list of top managers on the trip reads like a who 's who of germany industry : siemens chief peter loescher , deutsche bahn ceo ruediger grube , linde ceo wolfgang reitzle and eon-ruhrgas manager bernhard reutersberg . the german chamber of industry and commerce estimates that current projects in the gulf are worth around 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.5 billion -rrb- .
according to middle east expert felix neugart , trade is no longer restricted to traditional infrastructure projects like housing construction , power and water supply .
" increasingly , qualitative aspects are gaining more and more importance , ranging from traffic planning , waster disposal , recycling and water treatment projects , " said neugart .
" german companies are well positioned in these market areas . "
despite the economic downturn , the gulf region still enjoys a strong economic growth rate that hardly ever dips below the 5 percent mark , thanks to its vast oil and gas resources .
between 2000 and 2008 , german exports tripled in the gulf region .
then the global financial crisis hit and exports plunged .
" i believe that the trip sends an important signal at the right time , as these states gain more and more importance for us " , said neugart .
co2-free city on tuesday , merkel is scheduled to visit the city of masdar in the united arab emirates , a prestige project aiming to be the world 's first co2-free city .
it is also home to the international renewable energy association irena .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masdar is looking to become the world 's first co2-free city merkel 's next stop is saudi arabia where she intends to thank riyadh for its support in securing the release of two german hostages held by militants in yemen .
she will also hold talks with saudi businesswomen and give a speech at the king abdullah university for science and technology , the first academic institution where men and women study on a equal footing .
mideast peace efforts talks in saudi arabia , which is a g-20 member , will concentrate on the planned reform of the financial markets , the upcoming g20 summit in canada , the deadlocked middle east peace process and the nuclear standoff with iran .
merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen said the countries in the gulf cooperation council have a central role to play in resolving the standoff with iran .
" states in this region view iran 's nuclear programme as a threat to their security .
as direct neighbors they would automatically be affected and also are the first victims in any escalation , " he said .
" that 's why we want to win their cooperation .
on the one hand in negotiations , and if these negotiations fail - sanctions .
and as neighbors they will be called upon to ensure , first and foremost , that these sanctions are imposed and monitored . “ on the final leg of her gulf tour , merkel will hold political talks with bahrain before returning to berlin .
the trip is not without its stumbling blocks , however . for years negotiations on a free trade zone with the gulf cooperation council have been at a standstill .
because of the weak euro , the german leader will not have the same political clout she 's been used to in the past .
that means she may have to wait before winning greater access to the lucrative gulf markets .
